Former President Trump discusses protecting life in America during Fox News townhall.
President Biden’s presidential campaign released a new attack ad on Sunday attempting to blame former President Donald Trump for the overturning of Roe v. Wade, as the Biden-Harris ticket seeks to make the abortion issue front and center. 
The ad features Dr. Austin Dennard, an OB/GYN and mother of three in Dallas who says she was forced to leave the state of Texas to get an abortion after at a "routine ultrasound" she learned "that the fetus would have a fatal condition" and "that there was absolutely no chance of survival." 
"Having this beautiful, messy, chaotic, but wonderful family, it’s the joy of my life," she says. "I never thought that I would need an abortion for a planned pregnancy. But I did. Two years ago, I became pregnant with a baby I desperately wanted," Dennard says. "In Texas, you are forced to carry that pregnancy. And that is because of Donald Trump overturning Roe v. Wade. The choice was completely taken away. I was to continue my pregnancy, putting my life at risk. It’s every woman’s worst nightmare, and it was absolutely unbearable. We need leaders that will protect our rights, and not take them away. And that’s Joe Biden and Kamala Harris." 
The ad ends with two still images of Biden and then Biden and Harris, with the president voicing over, "I’m Joe Biden and I approve this message." The Biden campaign captioned the ad on X, writing, "Because of Donald Trump, Dr. Austin Dennard was forced to flee Texas to get the heath care she needed to save her life. It’s simply outrageous." 
ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, JANUARY 22, 1973, SUPREME COURT ISSUES LANDMARK ROE V. WADE DECISION
Monday marks the 51st anniversary of the Supreme Court’s 1973 decision on Roe v Wade.

The landmark decision was overturned in June 2022 – during Biden’s term – in the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization ruling. 
Trump, who claimed responsibility for the overturning of Roe after adding conservative justices to the court during his administration, has described himself as the most "pro-life president" but took some criticism from conservatives in September after criticizing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s six-week ban. 
Trump vowed to come to a compromise on how long into pregnancy to ban abortion outright, potentially around 15 weeks, and condemned late-term abortions. 
The vice president is expected to deliver remarks in Big Bend, Wisconsin, on Monday, as part of her "Fight for Reproductive Freedoms" tour, and per Harris’ office, will speak about how she "will also hold extremists accountable for proposing a national abortion ban, call on Congress to restore the protections of Roe, and outline steps the Administration is taking to protect access to health care." Biden, meanwhile, will convene the fourth meeting of the Task Force on Reproductive Healthcare Access, "where agencies will announce new actions to protect access to reproductive health care," the White House said.

PRO-LIFE VOTERS REVEAL HOW THEY REALLY FEEL ABOUT TRUMP'S STANCE ON ABORTION
In a statement released by the White House on Monday, Biden said he and Vice President Kamala Harris "are fighting to protect women’s reproductive freedom against Republicans officials’ dangerous, extreme, and out-of-touch agenda. We stand with the vast majority of Americans who support a woman’s right to choose, and continue to call on Congress to restore the protections of Roe in federal law once and for all." 
"Fifty-one years ago today, the Supreme Court recognized a woman’s constitutional right to make deeply personal decisions with her doctor—free from the interference of politicians," Biden said. "Then, a year and a half ago, the Court made the extreme decision to overturn Roe and take away a constitutional right. As a result, tens of millions of women now live in states with extreme and dangerous abortion bans. Because of Republican elected officials, women’s health and lives are at risk. In states across the country, women are being turned away from emergency rooms, forced to go to court to seek permission for the medical attention they need, and made to travel hundreds of miles for health care."

"Even as Americans—from Ohio to Kentucky to Michigan to Kansas to California—have resoundingly rejected attempts to limit reproductive freedom, Republican elected officials continue to push for a national ban and devastating new restrictions across the country," the statement added.  
Harris on X also wrote, "We trust women to make decisions about their own body and their own future."

Chris Faddis, Solidarity HealthShare president, spoke with Fox News Digital at the annual March for Life about the current attacks on pro-life health care.
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Pro-life advocates may have faced political setbacks across the country since Roe v. Wade was overturned, effectively granting states the ability to regulate abortion.
As thousands gathered in the snow Friday on the National Mall ahead of the march around the Capitol to the Supreme Court, many called for a continued expansion of the pro-life cause to include policies and programs to help mothers and families, not just work on legal battles.
"It's important that we not just combat the harm of abortion that it's causing our patients, but also recognize why women are oftentimes seeking abortion and do something about that," Christina Francis, CEO of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists (AAPLOG), told Fox News Digital on the sidelines of the March for Life Friday.
But some pro-life activists in the health profession told Fox News Digital they see other wins since the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson overturned nearly 50 years of Roe precedent. Doctors and medical professionals are rejecting messages from advocates for abortion.

"We definitely have seen a growth in our membership in the last two years, especially right after Dobbs. We had a huge increase in membership," Francis said.
AAPLOG's medical student and resident fellowships increased from about 200 to around 400 since the 2022 Dobbs decision, and total membership increased from 7,000 to around 7,500. In the past decade, the group tripled in total membership.
Some new members join AAPLOG due to feeling left behind by the pro-choice stances of the major medical institutions, according to Francis.
"What they're realizing now is that we are under active attack, I would say ... not just from pro-abortion advocates, but from our major certifying bodies," Francis said.
"Many of them are seeing the veil has been lifted, I think, on the true position of some of our major medical associations."
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), according to Francis, has acted inconsistently with many OB/GYNs' beliefs about providing quality health care.
In August 2023, ACOG Interim President Christopher Zahn wrote in a letter to The Washington Post expressing the belief abortion access should not be limited. 
"Abortion is safe. It improves and saves lives, and it must be available without restrictions, without limitations and without barriers — just as any other critical part of health care," Zahn wrote. 
PRO-LIFE GROUPS HAMMER ‘TWISTED ATTEMPT’ BY DEMOCRATIC AGS TO ‘HINDER’ PREGNANCY CENTERS FROM HELPING WOMEN
"I think that many physicians are seeing now how radical that position is," said Francis. "Maybe they're not exactly in the same position I am on abortion, but they recognize that there should at the very least be some limitation, and there should be safeguards put into place for women's safety and to ensure that they're in good care. We really are seeing a lot of physicians and other medical professionals wake up to what's been going on in our profession for quite some time."
ACOG last year released a fact sheet that dismissed as misinformation some pro-life terms — particularly the claims that abortion defenders want abortion to be legal to the point of birth.

"'[A]bortion up until birth' or ‘abortion after birth’ are examples of derogatory language used by opponents of abortion access that is not based in facts. Neither is accurate, and neither uses clinically appropriate language," ACOG's website states.
ACOG also says abortion later in pregnancy is rare and indicates that "something has gone terribly wrong regarding the patient’s health or the pregnancy."
Viewing abortion as something involving a single patient, according to Francis, is one of the issues driving medical practitioners to question the major health groups that insist abortion is health care.
PRO-LIFE VOTERS REVEAL HOW THEY REALLY FEEL ABOUT TRUMP'S STANCE ON ABORTION
"We know that induced abortion is not health care. It ends the life of one of our patients, and it significantly harms our other patients," said Francis. 
"They need to point out the extreme, radical nature of what [Democrats] will do if they get into office and have the majorities in the House, Senate and the White House. It'll be abortion until birth. In debates, when facing down your Democratic opponent, make him or her defend that."
"This abortion fight is it's not just Planned Parenthood clinics and the pregnancy centers, it is in health care today," said Chris Faddis, president of Solidarity HealthShare. 
"The health care system is pushing people more and more towards early fetal testing, so they can push people to abortions and their children into, you know, Planned Parenthood for regular female care, so they can get them on birth control and a board of patients and those things," Faddis said.
AHEAD OF MARCH FOR LIFE, MISSISSIPPI UNVEILS MOBILE APP TO HELP PREGNANT MOMS
Concerned Women for America President Penny Nance told Fox News Digital a priority for the pro-life movement must be expanding ways for struggling pregnant women and mothers to get assistance, be it public or private.
"We know the No. 1 reason a woman chooses abortion is that she isn't supported," said Nance.
One proposal is a national clearinghouse where a pregnant woman can search her zip code for resources near her — not just medical, but financial assistance, help with bills and food or employment. The idea is similar to a program in Mississippi that launched in the past year to collect public assistance and nonprofits into one searchable database.

March for Life has also been a political advocacy group, and in light of recent setbacks at the ballot box for abortion issues, pro-lifers have urged pro-life politicians not to avoid the issue, but to put Democrats on the defensive.
"They need to point out the extreme, radical nature of what [Democrats] will do if they get into office and have the majorities in the House, Senate and the White House. It'll be abortion until birth. In debates, when facing down your Democratic opponent, make him or her defend that," said Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J.

The rally came on the same day as the Republican primary in New Hampshire.

Throughout Biden’s talk, multiple protesters interrupted by shouting critiques of his administration’s handling of Israel's ongoing ground offensive against the terrorist group Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
Immediately after beginning his remarks, a male protester with a Palestinian flag shouted, "How many kids have you killed?" The protester was drowned out by the crowd chanting "four more years" as security escorted the protester out.

"This is going to go on for a while; they got this planned," the Democrat president said as the protesters were escorted out one by one.
The chaotic rally came on the same day as the Republican presidential primary in New Hampshire, where Trump plans to tighten his grip on his party's 2024 nomination.

It also came a day after the anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court case, Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion for nearly 50 years before it was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in the summer of 2022.

Biden and Democrats have made that consequential overturning a rallying cry for reelection.
"He's betting we won't hold him responsible," Biden said of Trump to the crowd of hundreds of cheering supporters. "He's betting you're going to stop caring."
"But guess what?" he added. "I'm betting he's wrong. I'm betting you won't forget."

Trump has taken credit for helping to overturn Roe v. Wade, but he has balked at laws like Florida's ban on abortions after six weeks, which was signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, who dropped out of the Republican nomination race over the weekend.

People attending the 2024 March for Life in Washington, D.C., spoke with Fox News Digital about abortion and the upcoming presidential election.
A medical student in Wisconsin who supports full-term abortions told a public hearing Monday that she would leave the state if she could not perform abortions or get the proper training to do so.
During a hearing before lawmakers at the state Capitol, pro-life and pro-choice people applauded and criticized, respectively, a bill that would ban abortion after 14 weeks.
Republican State Rep. Amanda Nedweski and Republican State Sen. Mary Felzkowski, who co-authored the bill, said the proposal was made to appease those who wanted either a total abortion ban or no restrictions on abortions.
Critics of the bill took issue with the fact that it does not include exceptions for rape or incest. The only exception for the 14-week proposal is in cases where the mother's life or health may be at risk.

"In the cases of rape or incest, this gives you 14 weeks to figure out what to do," Nedweski said of the criticism.
She also said the bill would likely be vetoed by Democrat Gov. Tony Evers, who has previously said he would stop any legislation that would place new restrictions on abortions. The state currently has a 20-week abortion ban.
Medical College of Wisconsin students Madalynn Welch and Maya Seshan told lawmakers they are worried the proposed 14-week ban would push people in the state away from becoming licensed OBGYN practitioners.
"When you put physicians in a gray area every day, their ability to quickly save the lives of the person they're working on makes their lives harder," Seshan said.
When Welch approached the microphone, she offered her personal opinions on abortion access and the potential impact on medical students.
"I think abortion should be unrestrictive. And I think when somebody finds out in pregnancy when – how far along that they are – when someone finds out, they should be able to get an abortion if they want to. And for some people, that is full term," she said.

Welch then said that if she cannot get abortion training this year, or if she cannot perform abortions in her career, she would not stay in Wisconsin.
"A lot of my colleagues who are on the same track agree," she added.
The Medical College of Wisconsin's website notes that a critical aspect of the specialty of obstetrics and gynecologists includes access to contraception as well as safe and legal pregnancy termination.
"Restricting access to reproductive care disproportionately affects our most vulnerable patients, erodes the trust and sanctity of the patient-physician relationship, and criminalizes physicians – all of which negatively impact the health of our community," the website says.

"Our Department stands with the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology and other leading Medical and Healthcare organizations who oppose a ban on abortions. We add our voice to those advocating for access to comprehensive reproductive healthcare for all our patients," the website notes.
Welch and the Medical College of Wisconsin did not return Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Will 2024 be the charm for a third-party candidate?
President Biden on Tuesday said former President Trump is "most responsible" for the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, blaming his predecessor for "stripping away" abortion rights and vowing to veto any potential national abortion ban.
Biden made the comments at a "Reproductive Freedom" campaign rally in Manassas, Virginia, on Tuesday afternoon.
BIDEN CALLS ON CONGRESS TO RESTORE ROE V. WADE ABORTION PROTECTIONS AS FEDERAL LAW: 'THIS IS NOT OVER'
"I believe Roe v. Wade got it right," Biden said. "A New Supreme Court made an extreme decision overturning Roe v. Wade with their Dobbs decision."
Biden said the high court "did what it had never done before."
"It ripped away a fundamental constitutional right that was in place for nearly 50 years and that was so important to so many Americans for so long," Biden said, stressing that the "health and lives of women in this nation would be at risk."

Biden said women are "being turned away from our emergency rooms, forced to travel hundreds of miles to get basic health care, forced to go to court to plead to help to protect themselves, and the ability to often have children in the future."
"The cruelty is astounding and it's a direct affront to a woman's dignity to be told by extreme politicians and judges to wait to get sicker and sicker before anything can happen, even to the point where, as you heard your life had been determined to be in danger, or the idea that a woman should have to carry a fetus after she'd been raped or the victim of incest," Biden said. "It's outrageous."
"Or the idea a woman receives competent medical advice that the fetus she's carrying won't live and will impact on her ability to have children in the future and she still can't get medical care," he continued. "I think it's unconscionable that anyone think that anyone think that this is where America is going in 2024."
"Let there be no mistake: the person most responsible for taking away this freedom in America is Donald Trump," he said. "Trump says he’s proud that he overturned Roe v. Wade."
SUPREME COURT OVERTURNS ROE V. WADE IN LANDMARK OPINION
The Supreme Court ruling in 2022 came in the court's opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. The ruling returns the issue of abortion back to the states after nearly 50 years. 
Biden pointed to the 21 states that have enacted abortion bans, and blamed Trump.
Biden has criticized Trump for creating a conservative majority on the high court. Trump, during his administration, appointed conservative Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.
"The reason women are being forced to travel out of state—women are being forced to travel across state lines for health care is Donald Trump," he said. "When you are threatened with prosecution, it's because of Donald Trump."
"And the reason their fundamental right has been stripped away is Donald Trump, and because of Donald Trump, doctors are fleeing their home states, setting up practices in other states because they're afraid they'll be put in prison if they exercise their responsibilities in states like Texas," Biden said. "Doctors Can get a life sentence for providing the care they were trying to provide. It's Outrageous."
Biden claimed that Trump and "MAGA Republicans," which he said includes House Speaker Mike Johnson "are hell bent on going even further."

"To date, MAGA republicans in Congress propose three additional national abortion bans to criminalize health care in every state," Biden said. "Let me tell you what they are: First is a zero-week ban with absolutely no exceptions. The second one introduced is a six-week ban with a penalty for violating — it is jail. And the third is a 15-week ban and the penalty is a five-year jail sentence."
Biden warned that "even if you live in a state where extremist Republicans are not in charge of the state government, your right to choose your right to privacy is still risk."
"But as long as I have power of the presidency, know, this — if Congress are to pass a national abortion ban, I will veto it. I will veto it," Biden said. Look, MAGA Republicans are trying to limit all women in America from getting a safe and effective medication."
Biden added: "I don't think this court and the MAGA Republicans have any clue about the power of women in America. I don't think that they have any clue but they're about to find out."
Biden went on to say the 2024 election is "going to be the most important election we've had since 1864."

"I mean, the reasons are clear. Democracy is on the ballot. Freedom is on the ballot — like the freedom to choose, the freedom to vote, the freedom to love who you want, the freedom to go to work, go to school, go to your house and worship without fear of being gunned down by a weapon of war," Biden said.
"So my question to you is simple. Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to protect our freedoms? And are you ready to win this election? Let's get this done," Biden said. "Talk to your families and friends. Organize your community. Register to vote. Get people to the polls. And let's remember who we are. We are the United States of America. And there's nothing, nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together."

Fox News' Shannon Bream reacts to the Supreme Court's abortion pill ruling, discusses Sen. Dick Durbin calling for Chief Justice John Roberts to testify before a Senate committee as well as her new book.
Three Republican attorneys general have asked to join a lawsuit pending before the Supreme Court that could determine whether women have access to the abortion pill, mifepristone. 
Missouri, Idaho and Kansas on Monday jointly filed a motion to intervene in U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) vs. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, which, if granted, would allow the states to become plaintiffs in the case. The move is an effort to keep the lawsuit alive if the justices find the pro-life doctors who originally challenged the FDA's approval of mifepristone lack standing to do so.
"This is one of the most important cases before the Supreme Court this term. We're fighting to protect women and their unborn children from these dangerous abortion pills," Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey told Fox News Digital in a statement. 
The Supreme Court last month agreed to consider appeals from the Biden administration and drug manufacturer Danco Laboratories defending deregulation of mifepristone, the abortion pill, as part of an effort to make it easier to access and use the drug since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.

In its landmark June 2022 decision, the court ruled in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization that the U.S. Constitution does not guarantee the right to an abortion and that the matter should be decided by the states. In the aftermath, 14 states have banned abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions, and two others have banned abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected, which is around six weeks of gestation.
The case now pending before the court concerns pro-life doctors and medical groups that sued the FDA in 2022, alleging that the agency unlawfully approved mifepristone in 2000 and that the drug is unsafe. 
Mifepristone, known by the brand name Mifeprex, is a pill taken with misoprostol in a two-drug regimen that first deprives an unborn baby of hormones it needs to stay alive and then causes cramps and contractions to expel the dead fetus from the mother's womb.
In a highly controversial ruling, the district court in Texas where the case originated halted the FDA's approval of mifepristone, triggering an appeals process that has now landed before the Supreme Court.

The Biden administration and Danco are asking the high court to reverse an appellate ruling that would cut off access to the abortion pill through the mail and impose other restrictions, even in states where abortion remains legal. The restrictions include shortening from the current 10 weeks to seven weeks the time during which mifepristone can be used in pregnancy. The nine justices rejected a separate appeal from abortion opponents who challenged the FDA's initial approval of mifepristone as safe and effective in 2000.
The case will be argued in the spring, with a decision likely by late June, in the middle of the 2024 presidential and congressional campaigns.
Before the Supreme Court agreed to hear the appeal, Idaho, Kansas and Missouri moved to intervene in the case in the original district court. Texas U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk allowed the three states to join the lawsuit on Jan. 12, 2024, but by then the Supreme Court had already agreed to hear the case. 
Now, the Republican attorneys general say the Supreme Court should allow them to join the lawsuit as plaintiffs, asserting there are injuries their states have suffered that the pro-life doctors and medical groups are unable to address in court. They claim that abortion rights organizations have shipped abortion pills into their states, with the assistance of the FDA, in violation of state abortion bans.

"FDA's actions impose substantial monetary and sovereign harm on the States. The private plaintiffs have no capacity to assert the States' interests. So if this Court denies intervention and holds that the private plaintiffs lack standing, the States may be forced to wait for relief until this Court resolves a future emergency application or certiorari petition by Petitioners," the states told the court in a legal filing.
Bailey, in the filing, also pointed to data that shows thousands of women have traveled out of state to purchase mifepristone and then return to Missouri. "The Federal Government admits that 5 to 8 percent of these women experience significant complications after returning home," the filing states. 
"Intervention would also promote efficiency," the attorneys general argued, observing that their separate challenge to the abortion pill is likely to end up before the court "within months" anyway. 
Should the Supreme Court decline their motion to intervene, the Republicans said they "are happy simply to submit an amicus brief." 
"I am very pleased the district court in Texas has recognized Idaho’s standing in this case.  We intervened over concerns for the safety of Idaho women and the virtually unregulated access to mail-order abortion pills," Idaho Attorney General Raul Labrador told Fox News Digital in a statement. "The Federal Drug Administration’s recklessness puts the lives of both pregnant women and their unborn children in medical jeopardy."

"Biden is beholden to the nation’s most radical abortion extremists so the FDA is allowing the shipment of chemical abortion pills," Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach said. "The FDA lacks the statutory authority to do so. And that’s why Kansas is suing."
The FDA has defended its approval of mifepristone and said the drug is safe when used correctly.
"The FDA approved Mifeprex more than 20 years ago based on a thorough and comprehensive review of the scientific evidence presented and determined that it was safe and effective for its indicated use," the FDA's website states.
Alliance Defending Freedom senior counsel Erik Baptist, who is representing the private plaintiffs, expressed optimism that the Supreme Court will ultimately come down on their side.
"Women should have the ongoing care of a doctor when taking high-risk drugs," Baptist said. "The FDA betrayed women and girls when it removed safety standards that it previously deemed necessary for women’s health and well-being. The FDA should do the right thing and protect women and girls. Three courts have already agreed with us, and we are hopeful that the U.S. Supreme Court will also agree."

Fox News correspondent Lucas Tomlinson has the latest on the annual pro-life demonstration on 'Special Report.'
For a prominent pro-life group, recent setbacks at the ballot box have not tampered spirits for the future of the movement to create a culture that protects unborn life in the womb.
The March for Life — the organization and the annual event that attracts tens of thousands of people (at least) from across the country each January — has grown significantly in the 50 years since the first march in 1974.
Activists assembled on the first anniversary of the Supreme Court's 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade, which effectively made abortion legal in every state across the country. Since then, the march always had Roe as its chief point of protest, but in the year and a half since the Supreme Court overturned Roe's precedent in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health, the energy surrounding the march has not waned.
"The march for life was born in a moment after Roe was overturned, and there was a lot of confusion about choosing life, and the unborn child," March for Life President Jeanne Mancini told Fox News Digital in an interview. "We think this particular moment calls for these marches, and that the pro-life grassroots needs strengthening and even a little direction right now. That's where we see the state march program as being so critically important."

In the past five years, the March for Life has expanded to the state level, hosting annual rallies in cities across the country organized by state chapters of the national organization.
The state-level expansion is moving fast. In 2018, March for Life Virginia held an inaugural march. In 2023, eight states held marches, and next year March for Life will be in 17 states, and Mancini has plans to be in every state in the union in the next six years or so.
Following the Dobbs decision in June 2022, pro-life leaders and conservative politicians have sought to redirect activism to state-level political battles and focus on creating a "culture of life." March for Life's goal, Mancini said, is to create a world where "abortion is unthinkable."
That effort is as much about helping women with unexpected pregnancies as it is about changing laws around abortion.
"There's so much confusion about what it means to be a woman, and frankly, what it means to be pro-life. The heart of pro-life is supporting women and wanting what's best for them," Mancini said.
The political fight over abortion does not appear to be going away, and pro-life leaders are far from giving up on pushing for state or national pro-life legislation.
However, pro-life causes have had a series of setbacks in statewide ballot initiatives in the past two elections. Most recently, Ohio voted to enshrine a right to access abortion into its state constitution in November.

Wade, demanding an end to legal abortion in the United States. (Photo by Albin Lohr-Jones/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images)
"With the ballot initiatives, we're learning a lot," Mancini said. "As we're moving and changing culture, we're going to have lessons along the way."

As many pro-life leaders have pointed out, Mancini noted that public opinion surveys show most Americans are not in favor of completely unrestricted abortion.
"For at least 12 years strong, 7 out of 10 Americans would limit abortion at most to the first three months of pregnancy. And that's not our national law," Mancini said. "Some states do enact protective laws of life prior to that moment, which is wonderful, but our national law is not in line with most of Europe." 
The theme of the 2024 March for Life is "with every woman, for every child." It aims to address the confusion and show that being pro-life is not only about political fights without regard to the difficulties of an unplanned pregnancy.

"We see two patients when someone is facing an unexpected pregnancy, and we want both of those patients to fully flourish."
The Charlotte Lozier Institute released a report earlier in December about the impact nearly 3,000 pro-life pregnancy centers across the nation have had serving women.
The report showed that in 2022 alone, the network of mostly locally-run pregnancy centers provided nearly 800,000 new client consultations, 700,000 pregnancy tests, half a million ultrasounds, and hundreds of thousands of STI tests, parenting classes and sexual risk avoidance education.
Pregnancy centers also provided "after-abortion support" to 20,000 clients.
The centers also delivered $358 million worth of material support for new mothers, including cribs, strollers, diapers, baby formula and car seats, the report said.

Mancini said there was a distinction between advocacy for abortion access, and the pro-life movement. Abortion access tends to prey on women's fears, implying that those carrying an unplanned pregnancy are not capable of bearing or raising children, Mancini said.
"The pro-life movement is the opposite," Mancini said. "We want to encourage and support women, come alongside them and strengthen them; and tell them 'you can do this. You have what it takes to do this. This is going to be hard, but it will be beautiful, and we will be here with you.'"

Former Vice President Mike Pence goes after Nikki Haley for her answer on whether she supports a six-week abortion ban.
Former Amb. Nikki Haley and former Vice President Mike Pence went head-to-head on the issue of abortion Wednesday night, with Haley calling for "consensus" on the issue and Pence firing back that would be "the opposite of leadership."
The Republican presidential candidates were asked during the first GOP primary debate Wednesday night about the issue of abortion and whether they would support a nationwide abortion ban.

"Not because the Republican Party tells me to be, but because my husband was adopted and I had trouble having both of my children—so I’m surrounded by blessings," Haley said. "Having said that, we need to stop demonizing this issue."
The Supreme Court, last year, overturned the 1973 landmark case, Roe v. Wade, bringing the issue of abortion back to the states for the first time in nearly 50 years.
"Now, it has been put in the hands of the people," Haley said.

But as for a federal ban, Haley said politicians "need to be honest with the American people and say it will take 60 Senate votes, it will take a majority of the House."
"So, in order to do that, let’s find consensus," she said. "Can't we all agree that we should ban late-term abortions? Can’t we all agree that we should encourage adoptions? Can’t we all agree that doctors and nurses who don’t believe in abortion shouldn't have to perform them? Can't we all agree that contraception should be available? And can’t we all agree that we are not going to put a woman in jail or give her the death penalty if she gets an abortion?"

She added: "Let’s treat this like the respectful issue that it is and humanize the situation and stop demonizing the situation." 
But Pence fired back, maintaining his pro-life record, but slamming Haley’s push for "consensus."
"You're my friend, but consensus is the opposite of leadership," Pence said. "When the Supreme Court returned this question to the American people, they didn’t just send it to the states only—it is not a states-only issue. It is a moral issue."
Pence vowed that if elected, he would be a "champion for life in the Oval Office." 
"It is going to take unapologetic leadership—leadership that stand on principle and expresses compassion for women in crisis pregnancies—I will do that as President of the United States," Pence said.

But Haley offered a rebuttal, saying that a federal ban is far-fetched.
"No Republican president can ban abortions any more than a Democrat president could ban all those state laws," she said. "Don’t make women feel like they have to decide on this issue, when you know we don’t have 60 Senate votes." 
She added: "You have to be honest with the American people."

Pro-lifers at the 2024 March for Life in Washington, D.C., spoke with Fox News Digital about abortion and the upcoming presidential election.
WASHINGTON D.C. – Pro-life voters are not overjoyed with former President Trump's comments on abortion late last year, but some still plan to vote for him if he wins the Republican nomination.
At the 2024 March for Life rally in Washington, D.C., Fox News Digital spoke with voters who were torn over his recent comments.
Trump was vocally pro-life throughout his presidency, but he drew backlash after telling MSNBC in September that Gov. Ron DeSantis' six-week ban on abortion was "a terrible thing and a terrible mistake."
"I mean, ‘DeSanctus’ [DeSantis] is willing to sign a five-week and six-week ban," the former president told the outlet. "I think what he did is a terrible thing and a terrible mistake."
"I would sit down with both sides, and I'd negotiate something, and we'll end up with peace on that issue for the first time in 52 years," Trump added.

One voter at the March for Life told Fox News Digital that there should be no "compromise" when it comes to abortion.
"While Trump was an amazing president for the pro-life movement. We have seen, unfortunately, that he seems to want to compromise on the abortion issue, and we think that it is never okay to compromise on killing innocent children," a young voter told Fox News Digital. "And that's what abortion is. And so if I could talk to President Trump right now, I'd maybe ask him what he's thinking."
PRO-LIFE LEADER ANTICIPATES MAJOR VICTORIES DESPITE RECENT BALLOT INITIATIVES EXPANDING ABORTION ACCESS
Another individual said that Trump's comments on his opponent's six-week ban were "very heartbreaking" and will "probably affect how I vote."
"It definitely makes me wonder what his actual opinions on abortion are, versus like if he's just saying these for votes," one voter told Fox.

While some pro-lifers are concerned over the comments, other rally-goers believe Trump is pro-life, and they will continue to support his third bid for the presidency.

"Overall, with other policies and things, I think I would still vote for Trump," one woman told Fox.
Another individual suggested that while some candidates may support earlier bans on abortion, six weeks might be difficult for a candidate to push on the national stage.

"I think Trump is pro-life. I think we'll stick with his vote," another pro-Trump voter told Fox. "But politically speaking, you know, six weeks is a hard push. You know, my ultimate goal is [a] total ban on abortion. That's what I would like. But politically speaking, you got to take one step at a time. And I think it's where Trump is coming from."
One individual said that his actions on abortion while president speak louder than his recent comments.
"It's really the actions that matter most. And we can see from Trump's presidency that his actions were pro-life, like, he got Amy Coney Barrett into the Supreme Court. And I think his actions speak louder than his words."
PRO-LIFE DEMONSTRATORS BRAVE DC SNOW FOR 2024 MARCH FOR LIFE
The Trump campaign touted the former president's pro-life record — particularly appointing Supreme Court justices who ultimately overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, returning abortion restrictions to states —  in a statement to Fox News Digital.
"President Trump’s unmatched pro-life record speaks for itself," said Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung. 
"He appointed strong Constitutionalist federal judges and Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade, which others have tried to do for over 50 years. He ended taxpayer-funded abortions, reinstated the Mexico City Policy that protects life abroad, and took many other actions to defend the unborn," Cheung said.

Cheung noted that pro-life advocacy group Susan B. Anthony List called Trump "the most consequential in American history for the pro-life cause.
"Throughout these unprecedented successes, President Trump has always advised fellow Republicans that they must learn to talk about this critical issue the right way and remind voters that it is Democrats who are the extreme ones on abortion, not Republicans, despite the left’s attempt to paint it that way," Cheung added. 
"Joe Biden and virtually every Democrat in Congress is on the record supporting on-demand abortion up until the moment of birth, and after birth, as well as using American tax dollars to fund the killing of the most vulnerable. That's why millions of pro-life Americans will vote to send President Trump back to the White House," he said.
