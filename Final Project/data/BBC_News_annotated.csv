BBCNews_1,"Pope Francis is evicting US Cardinal Raymond Burke, an outspoken critic, from his Vatican apartment and revoking his salary. Cardinal Burke is part of a group of American conservatives who have long opposed the Pope's plans for reforming the Catholic Church. A Vatican source told the BBC that Pope Francis has not yet carried out his intention to evict the 75-year-old. And the decision is not meant as a personal punishment, the source added. Instead, it comes from the belief that a person should not enjoy cardinal privileges while criticising the head of the church. Still, the move is ""unprecedented in the Francis era"", Christopher White, a Vatican observer who writes for the National Catholic Reporter, told the BBC. ""Typically, retired cardinals continue to reside in Rome after stepping down from their positions, often remaining active in papal liturgies and ceremonial duties,"" he said. ""Evicting someone from their Vatican apartment sets a new precedent."" Mr White warned that the decision could ""provoke significant backlash"" and deepen divides between the Vatican and the US church, where there is already ""fragmentation"".  Cardinal Burke has yet to respond to the news and the BBC has reached out to his office for comment. The Pope revealed his plan to act against the cardinal at a meeting with heads of Vatican offices last week. His frustration with US detractors who take a more traditional or conservative view on several issues appears to be coming to a boil. Earlier this month, he fired Joseph Strickland, a conservative Texas bishop who had blasted his attempts to move the church to more liberal positions on abortion, transgender rights and same-sex marriage. The removal followed a church investigation into governance of the diocese. A few months before, the Pope told members of the Jesuit religious order in Portugal that there was ""a very strong, organised, reactionary attitude in the US church"", which he called ""backward"", according to the Guardian. Tensions with Cardinal Burke, who was appointed by Pope Benedict XVI, have been simmering for nearly a decade, with the American prelate openly criticising Pope Francis over both social and liturgical issues.  ""Cardinal Burke's situation seems to stem from his gradual alienation from the Pope,"" said Mr White. ""It appears the Pope perceives Burke as fostering a cult of personality, centred around traditionalism or regressive ideals. This action seems aimed at limiting Burke's influence by severing his ties to Rome."" Most recently, the cardinal held a conference called The Synodal Babel in Rome on the eve of the Pope's synod, or meeting of bishops, last month.  He also joined fellow conservatives in publishing a ""declaration of truths"" in 2019 that described the Catholic church as disoriented and confused under Pope Francis, saying that it had moved away from core teachings on divorce, contraception, homosexuality and gender.  Notably, he disagreed with the Pope promoting Covid vaccines. Within church politics, he and Pope Francis were at odds over the firing of the head of the Knights of Malta after the order's charity branch was found to have distributed condoms in Myanmar. The Pope, in turn, has demoted Cardinal Burke within the church hierarchy or moved him to posts with less influence over the years. Michael Matt, a columnist for the right-wing Catholic newspaper The Remnant, wrote that the most recent action taken against Cardinal Burke showed that Pope Francis was ""cancelling faithful prelates who offer hierarchical cover to pro-life, pro-family, pro-tradition hardliners"". He accused the Pope of putting critics into ""forced isolation"".  The man who burned himself in Washington DC is an active-duty US airman, local media report. After Alabama rules that frozen embryos are children, some fertility patients pray that lawmakers find a solution. The former president moves closer to the Republican nomination with a huge win in his rival's home state. The US says the allies targeted 18 sites, including missile storages, drones and radars.

BBCNews_2,"Chileans are voting in a referendum to decide whether to adopt a new constitution to replace the one brought in under Gen Augusto Pinochet.  A previous draft put forward by an elected body dominated by left-wing delegates was rejected last year.  A constitutional council, this time dominated by right-wing delegates, has drafted a new, more conservative version. But polls suggest Chileans remain divided on whether to approve it. The drive for a new constitution started in 2019 after massive anti-government protests rocked Chile, which is normally seen as a haven of stability in the region. The protesters, many of whom were left-wing students, demanded drastic social and political change. After months of disruption, the conservative president at the time, Sebastián Piñera, agreed to launch a process to rewrite the 1980 constitution. But the first draft, crafted by a constitutional convention chosen by voters, proved too radical for many. Many balked at its sweeping reforms and its proposals to change many of the country's established institutions, such as replacing the 200-year-old Senate with a new Chamber of Regions. It also proposed declaring Chile a ""plurinational state"", recognising the rights of Chile's indigenous groups - which make up about 13% of the population - to their lands and resources. In September 2022 it was rejected by 62% of voters. A new constitutional council - this time made up of 24 individuals designated by Congress and 51 representatives elected by the Chilean people - was created to come up with a new draft.  It is this revised draft which Chileans have been asked to approve or reject this Sunday.  Opinion polls suggest that this second draft may also fail to get the backing necessary for it to come into force, with 46% telling pollsters they plan to vote against the draft and only 38% saying they will back it, with 16% still undecided. While the first draft was widely criticised for being ""too far-left"", some voters have said that this second draft has veered too far to the right.  Socialist Party Senator Paulina Vodanovic warned that the new text represented ""a move backwards"" on many aspects of Chilean social and political life, such as gender issues. Other leftist critics argue that the revised proposal fails to adequately protect indigenous rights. On the issue of abortion, for example, left-wing critics deem the proposed text too ambiguous and say it could allow future restrictions on existing reproductive rights.  Left-wing critics also dislike the weight given to private property rights and the fact that the new text enshrines private sector participation in the provision of basic services such as health, education or pensions. Some describe it as being more conservative than the current constitution it aims to replace.  Proponents of the new draft say it gives individuals more choice by letting them decide if they prefer public or private providers for basic services. Natalia González, a member of the constitutional council, wrote on X, formerly Twitter: ""If the state does it well, then they [the Chilean people] can opt for it, but if not, people don't have to remain captive. That freedom is protected in the new constitution."" The far-right Republican party, which holds a majority of the seats on the constitutional council, is backing the new draft.  The party's leader and former presidential candidate, José Antonio Kast, urged ""us Chileans who last year voted 'reject', now have to vote in favour, in favour of change, in favour of improvement"". The government of President Gabriel Boric, the left-wing former student leader who beat Mr Kast in 2021, has been accused by the opposition of openly promoting the ""reject"" option.  President Boric has already said that if the new draft is rejected, he will not push for another rewrite.  In that case, the current constitution will remain in place, although amendments and changes could be proposed.  Copyright 2024 BBC.

BBCNews_3,"Medical providers and fertility patients in Alabama have been left in uncertainty after a court ruled that frozen embryos are considered children. At least three fertility facilities have since paused new IVF treatments over concerns of ""legal risk"". ""There is an emotional side to this, and I don't think the law should be based on those emotions,"" one Alabama mother said. The ruling opens up a new front in the US battle over reproductive medicine. It is not yet clear what the impact might be in other parts of the country.  The Alabama Supreme Court ruling, which came down on Friday, was prompted by three couples who filed a case after their embryos were accidentally destroyed in an incident in 2020. A patient wandered into the part of a fertility clinic where the embryos being stored, handled them, and accidentally dropped them.  The ruling did not ban or restrict IVF and in fact, the couples who brought the case actively sought out the procedure. But experts say the decision may cause confusion about whether some aspects of IVF are legal under Alabama law - and over how to use and store embryos. President Joe Biden weighed in on Alabama's decision, saying it puts ""some fertility treatments at risk for families who are desperately trying to get pregnant"".  ""The disregard for women's ability to make these decisions for themselves and their families is outrageous and unacceptable,"" he said in a statement. ""This is a direct result of the overturning of Roe v Wade."" Alabama Fertility, the largest clinic in the state, announced in a Facebook post on Thursday its ""impossibly difficult decision to hold new IVF treatments due to the legal risk to our clinic and our embryologists"".  It said it was contacting affected patients ""to find solutions"", and would alert legislators ""as to the far reaching negative impact of this ruling on the women of Alabama"".  Another clinic, Mobile Infirmary, announced it would be pausing treatments as well, saying the court decision ""sadly left us with no choice"". ""We understand the burden this places on deserving families who want to bring babies into this world and who have no alternative options for conceiving,"" said Mark Nix, president and of Infirmary Health.  It comes after the southern US state's largest hospital stated on Wednesday its own decision to pause IVF services, over fears it could be exposed to criminal prosecution.  Dr Mamie McLean from Alabama Fertility told the BBC World Service Newshour programme that her patients would not be able to go through IVF in the near future. She said the court ruling made it ""impossible"" for IVF treatments to happen in the state, adding that ""there will be fewer babies in Alabama because of this"". She pointed out that Alabama already had one of the lowest net population growths in the nation. Dr McLean explained: ""If an embryo is considered a child, the legal ramifications are too far-reaching and scary. We cannot put our practice or our embryology team at the risk of significant legal penalty or even jail time. And unfortunately, our patients are bearing the burden of this misguided ruling."" IVF patients are also concerned about the ruling's ramifications.  Veronica Wehby-Upchurch, 42, told the BBC that she had her son - now three years old - via IVF and has two frozen embryos in the state.  Since the ruling, though, she fears prosecution. Because she already went through IVF before, she says that while she was ""appalled"" at the news, she was ""unfortunately, not shocked"", adding that ""those of us who have been paying attention sort of saw this coming"".  Ms Wehby-Upchurch says her desire is to have another child but she does not know now what her options are and, at 42, there's not a lot of time left.  ""I understand the idea of attaching emotions to embryos,"" she said. ""But you can't cuddle an embryo, you can't breastfeed an embryo. It took me five embryos to get to my one child I hold in my arms."" IVF - which stands for in-vitro fertilisation - offers a possible solution to women who face challenges getting pregnant. Officials say around 2% of US pregnancies are the result of this method. The process involves retrieving the woman's eggs with a needle from her ovaries and combining them with a man's sperm in a lab. The fertilised embryo is then transferred into the woman's uterus, where it may create a pregnancy. After Alabama rules that frozen embryos are children, some fertility patients pray that lawmakers find a solution. Several clinics paused treatment after a court ruled frozen embryos have the same rights as children. The case stems from a lawsuit brought by three couples whose frozen embryos were lost at a clinic. The state recently executed Kenneth Eugene Smith with the controversial method condemned by the UN. Dr Mathew Knowles says his daughter was inspired by her grandfather's favourite country music as a child. Copyright 2024 BBC.

BBCNews_4,"You probably shouldn't play Kim Petras's new EP to your mum. Titled Slut Pop Miami, it's an outrageous, sex-positive, club-ready tribute to the joys of carnal pleasure. Released on Valentines' Day, it was inspired by ""hedonistic trips to Miami"" and joins a lineage of explicit, transgressive pop, from Madonna's Erotica to Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion's WAP. ""Stirring up the culture and raising eyebrows has been in the DNA of pop forever,"" Petras tells the BBC. The EP is the German-born star's third release since last June, following her debut album Feed The Beast and Problématique, a surprise release of an earlier, scrapped project. This flurry of activity followed her appearance on Sam Smith's global chart-topper Unholy - which made Petras the first openly transgender artist to have a US number one and the first trans artist to win a major category Grammy.  Her mainstream breakout followed years of hard graft. Petras started uploading cover songs to MySpace in 2007, and later gambled on a move to Los Angeles in the hope of becoming a pop star. ""I played every gay club in America, I danced on every single bar and I built my following from the ground up,"" she says.  ""I didn't have my breakthrough until Unholy but, to get to that stage, I had to release multiple songs as an independent artist and prove to record labels that there's a fanbase out there for me."" That determination paid off. Now signed to Republic Records (home to Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande), she's in the middle of a sold-out, 40-date world tour.  On a rare day off, Petras called the BBC to reflect on her career to date. Hey Kim! Are we interrupting your vocal rest? Not today, I have a bunch of things lined up. But usually, between shows, I just shut up for two whole days. It's the only thing that works for singers who actually sing. Ah yes, you have a policy of never miming. How come? I just feel ripped off if I go to a show and the artist isn't singing. When you sing live, it makes the show different every night. Your performance reflects the energy of the crowd. If they're into it, you're going to hit all the high notes and do all the crazy runs. And knowing that gives the fans motivation to go crazy as well. It helps that you have a really strong voice... Well, I've always been really loud! I used to get in trouble with my neighbours because I love diva singers like Freddie Mercury or Cher, so it felt right for me to sing big. How did you train yourself to emulate Cher? Well, at first, you blow out your voice a bunch, until you realise you're screaming and doing it wrong. I used to sing from my throat a lot - for us Germans the ""R"" sounds are in our throats. Then you adjust and learn to sing from your body, not your throat.  But thank God, I had a voice to work with in the beginning. My parents taught me a lot, too. My dad's an architect, but he plays eight instruments and was always off to band rehearsals. And my mum was really into jazz, so there was a lot of Billie Holiday in the house. It's nice to hear that. So many interviews about your childhood focus on your gender transition, but music was always important? Absolutely. I was always singing. Music was my happy place and honestly very helpful in my transition. I went through that stuff very early [Petras completed gender reassignment surgery at 16] and music allowed me to sing and twirl and forget about how the world reacted to me. Once I started learning how to write, it immediately became my job. I figured, OK, you live in the middle of nowhere, no-one's going to write songs for you, so you'd better learn to do it yourself.  I wanted to be like an Indiana Jones of music and find the magic formula to pop. Does that explain why your songs are so upbeat and escapist, even now? Totally. I think there's a double standard in music where the stuff that gets taken seriously is sad and depressed, because those emotions are so hard. But a lot of the time, I feel very depressed and the way to get myself out of it is to write a ridiculous song. If I write a sad one, it's just going to make me sadder.  So, for me, making happy songs, or slutty songs, takes just as much effort as writing a slow ballad. Just because it doesn't seem like there's any hurt or pain going into the creation of that, it doesn't mean it's not there. Can you imagine a time where you would write about the things you went through as a teenager?  I try to stay away from the past. I find the past quite useless. I'm more focused on new and exciting things. But yeah, I definitely feel like, after releasing so many different projects, I need to go down new routes. Maybe it would be more about the stuff I'm currently going through, rather than the past. The lyrics on Slut Pop aren't especially deep, but the idea of relishing and celebrating sex still feels quite radical in pop. Why do you think that is?  It's something I feel strongly about. I've always been surrounded by incredible women. Even at school, the people who stood up for me and understood my condition were female. And I think men's desire to control women's bodies has been the plague of this planet forever. It very much goes hand in hand with being transgender. The people who wanted to forbid me to transition are the same ones who want to forbid women to have abortions or have sex and even make money from it. I'm a big fan of Madonna's work, and I feel like, when she celebrated sex in Erotica and her Sex book, people misunderstood it as just filth. But female sexuality isn't filth, and it shouldn't be written off like that. Neither is trans-feminine sexuality or anyone's sexuality. I think everybody should be equal. That's not to say Slut Pop is a big political statement. It's supposed to just be fun, but the conversation it stirs up is a good thing. A lot of the Slut Pop songs have blown up on TikTok. What are your thoughts on Universal Music removing music, including yours, from the app while they argue over royalty payments? I feel very protected by Universal. I know people who have number one records and can't afford their rent, so I'm proud Universal is taking a stand. Of course, right now, all of us Universal artists are screwed a little bit, but you've gotta take one for the team. The intentions are noble. It's about musicians making money from their art - and not just the famous faces, but the songwriters and the people behind the scenes. I feel like it's a really good fight. When royalty payments are so low, do you ever think about going back to your first job and writing advertising jingles? Me and my friends still make jingles all the time, just for fun. And if I ever had a stroke of genius and came up with something where I'm like, 'This has laundry detergent written all over it', then, for sure, I'm not above it. And about the money thing: I know what it's like to struggle and be a songwriter who lives on a studio couch and goes a year without getting any songs released but, at the end of the day, as long as I can write music, I'm happy. The money part is really for my fans. I want to put on the best show for them.  You're opening the Euro 2024 football tournament this summer. What can you tell us about that? I'm over the moon about it. Soccer is such a big part of German culture, so it feels like a huge deal. I have so many memories of watching matches with my friends and getting absolutely hammered, so it's gonna be crazy! Plus, the opening match is Germany v Scotland, so there'll be a lot of kilts in the stadium. Oh my God, that's my dream. It is America's first federal trial over an an alleged hate crime based on gender identity. First broadcast 25 years ago, Queer as Folk depicted three gay men in a way not seen on TV before. Festival organisers say they won't host the 2024 event to allow it to ""flourish and evolve"". The presenter is taking over from DJ Ace, who left the the station after 21 years.

BBCNews_5,"It was a political grenade in the form of a 345-page report. The pyrotechnics were delivered on Thursday afternoon in the findings of special counsel Robert Hur's investigation into Joe Biden's handling of classified documents after he left the vice-presidency in 2017. The top-line conclusion was that the president would not face criminal charges for his actions, despite evidence that he had ""wilfully retained and disclosed classified materials... when he was a private citizen"". The bottom line was much more damaging. Among the reasons Mr Hur listed for why he had decided not to prosecute the 81-year-old president was because he would likely be a sympathetic figure to a jury who would view him as a ""well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory"". Issues about Joe Biden's age and competency to serve another four years in office have been simmering for practically as long as Mr Biden has been in the White House, so this latest finding will provide fuel for Republican attacks and stoking concerns among some Democrats that the president is not up to the task. It is a narrative that the Biden campaign has been desperately trying to confront, said Chris Borick, the director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion. ""The polling, over and over, we see data points that suggest it is his largest liability into this election that voters think he's simply too old to run,"" he says. It's no surprise, then, that the Hur report prompted the White House to launch a furious counter-offensive that included the president holding an impromptu press conference, where he asserted that his memory was ""just fine"". ""I know what the hell I'm doing,"" he said. What's more, the special counsel presented specific evidence to back up this assertion. He wrote that during two days of interviews, Mr Biden had frequently been unable to recall details relevant to the investigation. More than that, Mr Hur recounted, he had struggled to recall which years he had been vice-president and when his oldest son, Beau Biden, had died of cancer. It was this last claim that prompted an angry response from the president during his press conference at the White House on Thursday evening. ""How in the hell he dare raise that?"" the president said. The press conference itself could lend more fuel to the attacks on Mr Biden, however, as the president answered a question about the Gaza War by referring to Egyptian President Mohamed al-Sisi as the president of Mexico. That stumble, not unlike other verbal miscues by Mr Biden in recent days, exposes the scope of the challenge facing his re-election effort. The best way for the president to address concerns about his age is to run a vigorous campaign and increase his public exposure. But every attempt comes with the risk of actions or evidence that feed existing concerns. The White House has made other efforts to defuse the potency of the Hur report. Mr Biden's personal lawyer, Richard Sauber, tried to convince the special counsel to drop references to Mr Biden's mental acuity and mental lapses, writing in a letter that such language was not ""accurate or appropriate"". Mr Biden also noted that he had given his two days of testimony to the special counsel shortly after the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel - while he was ""in the middle of handling an international crisis"", he said. Other Biden allies have pushed back on Mr Hur's impartiality, pointing out that he was appointed to a US attorney office by Donald Trump in 2017. It was Biden Attorney General Merrick Garland who selected Mr Hur as special counsel, however. The Biden team has also been quick to pounce on the verbal missteps of his likely November opponent, 77-year-old Donald Trump. The former president recently confused his primary opponent Nikki Haley with former Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and referred to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban as the leader of Turkey. The best case for the White House may be that this particular grenade exploded in February, a full nine months from election day.  Larry Sabato, the director for the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, says concerns about Mr Biden's age are already essentially baked into the race, making the report damaging but not fatal. The public ""will look at it, and will raise one eyebrow, not both"", he says. ""Because in a way, people already knew this. Even if you casually watch five minutes of a speech he's giving, you already know this,"" he says. When American voters finally head to the polls, the assertions contained in a special counsel report that ultimately declined to find Mr Biden criminally culpable will be of less concern than issues like the economy and abortion. The worst-case scenario, on the other hand, is that this is just the start of a cavalcade of evidence undermining the president on one of his weakest attributes. And the arrow of time only points one way. The president isn't getting any younger. With additional reporting from Madeline Halpert If you're in the UK, sign up here.

BBCNews_6,"Russian authorities are limiting access to abortions in an attempt to confront the country's longstanding demographic crisis.  Measures include making it an offence trying to persuade a woman to have an abortion and pressuring private clinics to stop carrying out the procedure. Feminist groups say the campaign is putting the lives of women at risk. The Russian Orthodox Church, which has close ties to the Kremlin, is playing a key role in the anti-abortion campaign.  ""As a member of the clergy, I testify that an abortion is a disaster and a tragedy for the woman those close to her,"" Patriarch Kirill, the Kremlin-backed head of the church, said in January 2023. ""Officials, ultra-right politicians and the church are actively forcing women and girls to give birth to unwanted children,"" said the Urals Feminist Movement group, which has organised small-scale protests in favour of abortion rights. ""These initiatives will only lead to a dramatic increase in the number of illegal abortions and a huge number of maimed and killed Russian women."" Russia's population is virtually the same size as it was over 20 years ago. According to official figures, there are now 144 million people in Russia - 2 million fewer than in 2001, when President Vladimir Putin first came to power.  Religious authorities say a key factor for the demographic crisis is the high number of abortions. Almost a third of Russian women say they have had one.  In 2022, more than 500,000 pregnancies were terminated, compared to 1.3 million children born in Russia. Mr Putin called it ""an acute problem"".  ""The population can be increased as if by waving a magic wand: if we solve this problem and learn how to dissuade women from having abortions, statistics will go up immediately,"" according to Patriarch Kirill. Authorities are concerned that the decreasing number of young people, particularly men, will make it more difficult for the Russian military to recruit soldiers. There are also worries about the effects of a stagnant population on the economy. Russian feminists say women's rights are being curtailed to benefit the military and economy. ""They need new taxpayers, they need new soldiers,"" Maria Mueller, of the Russian feminist association Ona, told the BBC.  The authorities are increasingly seeking to informally limit abortions, though the country's laws remain on paper some of the most liberal in the world. The Health Ministry has drawn up guidelines telling medics how best to dissuade women from having an abortion. Doctors are encouraged to tell pregnant women who are younger than 18 that young parents bond better with their children ""because they are practically from the same generation"".  If a pregnant woman is single, doctors are meant to tell her that ""having a child is no obstacle to finding a life partner"". In parallel, the authorities are restricting the sale of medication used to end pregnancies, sales of which increased by over 50% last year. From September 2024, pharmacies will be required to register the sale of such pills in special databases.  The government is also offering financial incentives to pregnant women and those who give birth, including payments of up to 524,500 roubles (£4,680, $5,830) which can be used to purchase property or pay for schooling. A fifth of abortions in Russia are carried out in private clinics, which have come under pressure from religious authorities to stop offering the service.  ""As a member of the clergy, I testify that an abortion is a disaster and a tragedy for the woman and those close to her,"" Patriarch Kirill said.  Accordingly, governors in 10 Russian regions are making efforts to stop private clinics from performing abortions. The annexed Ukrainian region of Crimea was the first territory where private clinics stopped performing abortions in early November. Days later, it was followed by the Kursk region, where four out of five private clinics no longer offer the service. Restricting access to abortions in private clinics will harm women's health, World Health Organisation expert Lyubov Yerofeyeva told BBC Russian. The Kursk region deputy governor, Andrei Belostotsky, called this ""a significant event"" because almost all women wishing to terminate their pregnancy will have to go to state hospitals, where the authorities will ""actively work with them"" trying to make them change their mind.  Another initiative proposed by Patriarch Kirill and already implemented in parts of Russia is a ban on ""incitement to abortion"".  ""We need more people. It's an obvious fact recognised by everyone, both politicians and sociologists alike,"" he told an Orthodox Church meeting. ""But for this to happen you need to make real efforts,"" he added. As an example, the patriarch pointed to the western region of Mordovia, which has introduced fines of up to 200,000 roubles ($2,250; £1,800) for trying to persuade a pregnant woman to have an abortion. He said such bans should be introduced across the country. Experts fear that the anti-abortion campaign will harm women's health by discouraging safer medical abortions. ""This will be a blow against medical abortions because this was the method promoted by the vast majority of private clinics. More than 80% of their procedures were medical abortions, while state hospitals mostly perform surgical ones,"" the WHO's Ms Yerofeyeva said.  ""Surgical abortions carry higher risks of complications, side effects and injuries. That's why the whole world is moving away from them."" Ms Yerofeyeva also fears that the clampdown on legal abortions will trigger a spike in dangerous illegal procedures. Jailed opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza refuses to be cowed following the death of Alexei Navalny. Western leaders are in Kyiv in a show of solidarity as the country grapples with a range of setbacks. King Charles rallies international support for the ""true valour"" of Ukraine's war against Russia. Ms Kallas says leaders risk ignoring lessons from 1930s and 1940s as war continues to rage in Europe. Kalla Kajas tells the BBC that leaders risk ignoring the ""lessons from the 1930s and 1940s"".

BBCNews_8,"Iowa's influential evangelical voters were once decidedly lukewarm on Donald Trump. But if recent polls are accurate, born-again Christians will carry him to victory on Monday in the Republican caucuses. What has changed?  The video is bombastic, even by Mr Trump's standards. Just consider the title: God Made Trump. ""God looked down on his planned paradise and said, 'I need a caretaker,'"" a voiceover intones over a minimalist piano track. ""So God gave us Trump."" The former president, according to the narrator, is carrying out the will of God. He's ""a shepherd to mankind"" who will ""fight the Marxists"" with ""arms strong enough to wrestle the deep state"".  The video is based on So God Made a Farmer, a 1978 speech by American radio host Paul Harvey which extols the virtues of simple rural American life.  Independently produced by a group calling itself ""Trump's Online War Machine"", the clip started to pick up steam a week ago when Mr Trump shared it with millions of followers on his Truth Social account. It immediately enraged some religious leaders here in Iowa.  ""He's not the saviour,"" said Michael Demastus, pastor of the Fort Des Moines Church of Christ in the state capital. ""Our allegiance as evangelicals is to Jesus, not to the Republican Party or to Donald Trump."" But despite Mr Demastus' insistence that many voters agree with him - and that a surprise is in store on Monday - opinion polls show a different story, with Mr Trump poised for a runaway victory over his Republican rivals. Evangelical support is crucial here in Iowa, with born-again Christians expected to make up around two-thirds of all Republican caucusgoers.  They are a diverse voting bloc - made up of various denominations and including more traditional churchgoers along with others who may not even regularly go to a church, yet still define themselves as evangelical. In 2016, Mr Trump picked up just 22% of this group on the way to a second-place finish behind Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who like previous Iowa Republican winners made faith a major part of his campaign. But since that time, when many were still sceptical of the blunt-talking New York businessman trailed by sex scandals, Mr Trump has made born-again Christians a key part of his voter base. In this Iowa caucus, surveys suggest he will get the support of roughly half of evangelical voters. Steve Scheffler, a Trump supporter and president of the influential Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition, said that Mr Trump had delivered for the religious right, and they expected him to do so again at a moment that many see as the most important election in their lifetimes. ""Evangelical voters know that we live in a society where things have gone awry,"" he said, mentioning culture war issues over gender identity and ""wokeness"". ""They believe things are very bad, and if they don't get involved, they are going to get much worse."" Mr Trump's opponents, particularly Florida Governor Ron Desantis, have put a lot of effort into earning the support of religious voters. Mr DeSantis won the coveted endorsement of Bob Vander Plaats, head of The Family Leader, a conservative Christian non-profit group. But Mr Scheffler argued that big-name endorsements weren't very important - ""they're nice to have, but they don't move the needle"". And Mr Trump has hit back, collecting endorsements of his own and sending surrogates such as his former housing secretary Ben Carson on a tour of Iowa churches. Mr Carson alluded to Mr Trump's unpredictability as he made the case for his former boss at a stop here last week. ""Would you rather have someone whose tongue is maybe a little wild, but has incredibly good policies that make your life better?"" he asked the congregation. ""Or someone who has a silver tongue and says all the right things and has terrible policies which ruin your life and those of your children and grandchildren?"" Self-described conservative evangelical David Pautsch is a huge fan of Mr Trump, and the former president is part of the reason he's decided to run for Congress in Iowa's 1st district, challenging a Republican incumbent from the right.  Mr Pautsch lives here in Davenport, a city of around 100,000 people in eastern Iowa, and was collecting signatures to back his campaign from hundreds of locals who braved frigid weather to visit a gun show at an exhibition centre.  Easily shifting between quoting Bible verses and Mr Trump's campaign messages - including immigration and his insistence that he did not lose the 2020 election - Mr Pautsch called the people who criticised the God Made Trump video ""too uptight and literal"".  Christians, he said, need to boldly demand that conservative religious values be injected into the heart of American government. ""Our country was never meant to be run without God."" Kedron Bardwell, a political science professor at Simpson College in Indianola, just outside Des Moines, said that Mr Trump had a key advantage over his rivals - a track record that aligned with evangelical priorities. His appointment of three conservative justices to the Supreme Court - and the overturning of Roe v Wade, which for decades had held that there is a constitutional right to abortion - is a key part of that record, as is his decision to move the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. If the polls turn out to be accurate, another crucial factor might be an evolving sense of what it means to be evangelical - one that is increasingly aligned with Mr Trump's particular flavour of right-wing politics.   Although church attendance is in long-term decline across the country, according to the Pew Research Center the number of white Americans describing themselves as ""evangelical"" went up during Mr Trump's presidency. And the group most likely to start using that label to describe themselves were the president's supporters.  ""In some ways 'evangelical' has become a political label more than a theological description,"" said Mr Bardwell, who studies religion and politics and is himself a long-time member of the evangelical community.  He described a deepening divide - mirrored in wider society - between church elites and the masses.  And he said that the decline in church attendance over time had meant that many of those who considered themselves religious were less influenced by spiritual leaders and more by right-wing media and politicians - Mr Trump foremost among them.  The former president regularly refers to religious themes and rarely misses a chance to contend that he is being persecuted by the authorities. Mr Bardwell said that he particularly appealed to ""spirit-led"" evangelicals, who see the divine playing out on the American political stage.  ""There's a portion of the evangelical community that's very attracted to the idea that God knows everything and God appoints leaders,"" he said. ""They believe that Donald Trump is the appointed leader at this moment in time."" On Sunday, most churches in this city in eastern Iowa were closed due to the winter storm that has sent temperatures plunging. But whether Iowa's believers will ignore the cold and turn out in force for Mr Trump on Monday will be a decisive factor in the Republican race.

BBCNews_9,"When Alabama's Supreme Court defined frozen embryos as children, the shock and confusion was immediate. Major hospitals pulled fertility services and would-be parents scrambled for clarity on what would happen next. The debate over reproductive rights in America has long been driven, in part, by opposition to abortion from Christian groups - but this ruling has divided that movement and ignited debate about the role of theology in US lawmaking. Margaret Boyce is soft-spoken, a private person, and certainly not - in her words - a ""crier"". She had been taking fertility drugs for 10 months and was days away from her first appointment for in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) when the justices of Alabama's top court upended her life. Their ruling, which prompted many fertility clinics to pause their work, has left her turning to the Bible daily for comfort. The 32-year-old and her husband have a young boy but, second time round, she is experiencing unexplained infertility. Building a family has always been the dream. ""I'm one of three. I feel like it's the greatest gift to give your child a sibling,"" she said. ""The journey to becoming parents is different for every single couple - mentally, emotionally and financially,"" she added, welling up. ""This ruling has added more unnecessary anxiety to something that is already so hard."" For a devout Christian like Margaret, the ruling - given its consequences for what she sees clearly as a process to create life - is even more difficult to comprehend. ""God,"" she said, ""tells you to go forth and be fruitful and multiply."" IVF is a difficult and lengthy treatment, involving the fertilisation of a woman's eggs with sperm in a lab to create a microscopic embryo. The fertilised embryo is then transferred into a woman's uterus, where it may create a pregnancy - but a successful outcome is not guaranteed. Embryos are often frozen or eventually destroyed as part of IVF, which accounts for around 2% of US pregnancies. The Alabama court ruled that an existing law - wrongful death of a minor - covers not just foetuses in the womb, but embryos held in a lab or storage facility too. It did not explicitly restrict or ban IVF, but it has still created deep uncertainty for clinics and medical workers who handle embryos and fear prosecution. In recent days the office of the state's attorney general said he had ""no intention"" of pursuing criminal charges against IVF clinics - but one clinic told the BBC this statement lacked detail and did not quell their fears. While the majority of the justices rooted their ruling in law, Chief Justice Tom Parker also had a higher authority in mind, repeatedly invoking scripture in explaining his decision. The people of Alabama, he wrote in a concurring opinion, had adopted a ""theologically-based view of the sanctity of life"" in their state constitution. Delving into religious sources from classic Christian theologians like St. Thomas Aquinas and also a modern conservative Christian manifesto, he concluded that ""even before birth, all human beings have the image of God, and their lives cannot be destroyed without effacing his glory"". Some anti-abortion groups celebrated the explicit use of scripture in Justice Parker's opinion to justify what for them was a momentous decision.  Tony Perkins, president of evangelical activist group the Family Research Council, described it as ""a beautiful defence of life"". But the chief justice's theocratic justification has left Margaret puzzled. She doesn't believe in abortion but she also struggles to see a frozen embryo as a living person. For her, life begins with a heartbeat. ""Nobody understands more that an embryo is not a child,"" she said, before taking a pause, ""than the person yearning for that embryo to be a child."" US courts do sometimes make decisions that seem to be based on religious premises, said Meredith Render, a professor at the University of Alabama School of Law. But, she added, ""rarely do you see it as explicitly stated"" as in the chief justice's opinion. The ruling was however ""not an outlier"" for a conservative court in a red state, said Kelly Baden, the vice president for public policy at the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks abortion legislation across the US.  ""We do see that many elected officials and judges alike are often coming at this debate from a highly religious lens,"" she said. While the Alabama state Supreme Court is not appointed by the US president, more than 200 judges were appointed by Donald Trump to federal courts during his four-year term, winning him lasting support from American evangelicals. During his presidency he was able to nominate three new justices to the nine-member Supreme Court - all of whom sided with the majority in striking down the 1973 Roe v Wade decision that had guaranteed a federal right to abortion. Since that decision in 2022 re-opened a national battle over reproductive rights, courts in Missouri have quoted Biblical teachings to justify restricting abortion rights and a Trump-appointed judge in Texas who previously worked for a Christian legal organisation tried to impose a nationwide ban on Mifepristone, a commonly used abortion pill. While many Republican politicians comfortably agree with such rulings, restrictions on abortion imposed by conservative courts have proved a potent campaign issue for Democrats in recent elections, including the 2022 midterms.  The Alabama decision, made by Republican judges and affecting fertility treatments widely supported by the US public, went one step further, prompting immediate fear of a political backlash in a presidential election year.  Any sign of IVF being endangered could worsen the anger that's already cost Republicans since the fall of Roe v Wade, especially among suburban women and those who are uncomfortable with abortion bans. Donald Trump himself, the clear frontrunner in the Republican nomination race, came out strongly in support of IVF, calling on Alabama lawmakers to preserve access to the treatment. His last remaining rival Nikki Haley at first appeared to support the ruling, but then backtracked. ""It's a win philosophically for the pro-life movement because it carries on the pro-life recognition of unborn life,"" said Eric Johnston, president of the Alabama Pro-Life Coalition.  ""But you get into a very difficult situation, where you have this medical procedure that's accepted by most people, and then how do you deal with it? That's the dilemma. ""I agree with the opinion overall - I think it's well written opinion from the legal side and from the medical side,"" he added.  ""But I think the pro-life community in general supports IVF, and I've known and worked with many people who have had children via IVF. And at the same time, they think abortion is wrong. This issue is so different from abortion, but it has to do with life."" For patients in the deep-south state, the last week has been one of panicked phone calls to clinics, emails to local lawmakers and a rush by some to try and transfer frozen embryos out of the state. Rodney Miller, 46, and his wife Mary Leah, 41, spent a decade trying to have children, before IVF allowed them to give birth to a set of twins 18 months ago, who were adopted as frozen embryos. He said he ""thanks the Lord for the advances in science and medicine"" that made that possible. The couple are now going through the process again, and waiting to see if two embryos transplanted this week will develop into a pregnancy. ""This is not a win [for the Christian right],"" says Rodney, who works for Carrywell, an organisation that supports families through infertility. ""It's the classic case of you won the battle but lost the war. Fewer children will be born because of this unless things change. ""How did we become a state where if you want to terminate a pregnancy, you have to leave the state and if you want to initiate a pregnancy, via IVF you [also] have to leave the state?"" Whether the ruling in Alabama influences decisions elsewhere is an open question.  Foetal personhood bills, which enshrine the idea that life begins at conception, have been introduced in more than a dozen states. But these bills, while pushing the idea that a foetus or embryo is a person, don't explicitly relate that to the context of IVF, said Kelly Baden of the Guttmacher Institute. The Alabama ruling - with its implications that go far beyond abortion access - does not therefore constitute a trend, she said. Alabama family lawyer Ashleigh Meyer Dunham, who has used IVF herself, has been working with a large number of cases affected by the ruling. She said she was ""terrified"" that fertility patients in other states could eventually be affected. ""I think the biggest concerns are that people elsewhere forget about us and they think, 'Oh they're just the conservative state, and they're all country bumpkins. Don't worry it will never happen here.' ""And the next thing you know, it is happening in other states that are ultra-conservative."" Because the Alabama ruling involves an interpretation of state, not federal law, it is unlikely to reach the US Supreme Court. Currently a bill is going through the state house in Alabama, introduced by Democrats, which would aim to effectively pause the ruling and allow treatments to resume as before.  Republicans are expected to propose their own bill. If they do, they have to find a way to balance a divided religious constituency, with some celebrating the court's ruling and others disturbed by its potential implications for IVF. Margaret is praying that lawmakers find a solution. ""I'm not very outspoken, I keep myself to myself. But if any of my friends or family heard that I was sending emails to every single representative and senator, I think they would be shocked."" She takes a breath. ""But this has got me fired up. It is all I can think about now."" Alex Lederman contributed reporting from Alabama. Additional research from Kayla Epstein in New York.

BBCNews_10,"The Texas Supreme Court has ruled against a woman seeking an abortion for her high-risk pregnancy, hours after her lawyers said she was leaving the state for the procedure.  Kate Cox, 31, had sought an abortion after her foetus was diagnosed with a fatal condition that doctors said threatened her fertility.  A lower court granted an exception, but that order was overturned on Monday. Texas has one of the strictest abortion bans in the country.  The state's overlapping bans prohibit abortion from the point of conception, except in rare cases where the life of the expectant mother is under threat. Abortion advocates argue the exception is too vague and puts women's health at risk. In its seven-page ruling, the Texas Supreme Court found that Ms Cox's doctor had not proven that her safety was threatened due to a ""life-threatening physical condition"" as required under the law.  ""These laws reflect the policy choice that the Legislature has made, and the courts must respect that choice,"" the justices wrote. The case was believed to be the first instance of a woman seeking a court's permission for an abortion since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade last year, giving individual states power to control abortion access.  Ms Cox, a mother of two from the Dallas area, sought an abortion after her foetus was diagnosed with Trisomy 18, a chromosomal disorder which in the majority of cases results in miscarriage, stillbirth or the death of the baby within the first year of life. Ms Cox's physicians told her that continuing the pregnancy could jeopardise her future fertility.  According to Ms Cox's court filings, doctors refused to perform an abortion on her, saying their ""hands were tied"" as long as her baby had a heartbeat.  She was granted an exception by a Texas judge on Thursday. But the state's Attorney General Ken Paxton quickly threatened criminal prosecution against any doctors or healthcare providers who helped her obtain an abortion.  Mr Paxton also asked the state's Supreme Court - whose nine members are all Republicans - to intervene. The court obliged, temporarily blocking Ms Cox from obtaining an abortion while it reviewed the case.  On Monday, lawyers for Ms Cox announced she had left Texas to obtain an abortion outside of the state. There is no Texas-wide law prohibiting travel outside of the state for an abortion. ""This past week of legal limbo has been hellish for Kate,"" said Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, the pro-choice group representing Ms Cox. ""Her health is on the line. She's been in and out of the emergency room and she couldn't wait any longer."" Just hours after the announcement by Ms Cox's lawyers, the state Supreme Court announced it had ruled against her.  ""This should never happen in America,"" President Joe Biden said on Tuesday in a statement about Ms Cox's case.  ""Legal and medical chaos, as we are witnessing in states like Texas, Kentucky and Arizona, is a direct result of Roe v Wade being overturned, and as we predicted would happen, women's health and lives now hang in the balance,"" he added.  Speaking to the BBC on Monday, Molly Duane, a lawyer for the Center, called the Supreme Court's ruling ""stunning"". ""Politicians like to tout medical exceptions as being reasonable and available, as Kate's experience shows they simply don't exist in practice,"" she said.  The Texas Supreme Court is currently weighing another abortion case related to the state's health exception, also led by Ms Duane and the Center for Reproductive Rights. Twenty-two plaintiffs - including doctors and women denied abortions in the state - have sued to clarify the existing state bans, saying the medical exception is dangerously unclear.  The near-total bans have left physicians ""terrified"" to use their medical judgment over fear of harsh penalties, Ms Duane told the court last month. Doctors who perform abortions in Texas could risk life in prison, loss of their medical licence and hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines. A lawyer for the attorney general, Beth Klusmann, argued existing standards allowed physicians to use ""reasonable"" medical judgment.

BBCNews_11,"Donald Trump has said he supports the availability of IVF treatment, joining a growing number of Republicans who are seeking to distance themselves from an Alabama court ruling on the issue. The state's top court ruled last week that frozen embryos have the same rights as children and people can be held liable for destroying them. At least three clinics paused IVF treatment in the wake of the ruling. On Friday, Mr Trump called on Alabama to find ""an immediate solution"". ""We want to make it easier for mothers and fathers to have babies, not harder! That includes supporting the availability of fertility treatments like IVF in every State in America,"" the former president wrote on his Truth Social platform. ""[Like] the VAST MAJORITY of Republicans, Conservatives, Christians, and Pro-Life Americans, I strongly support the availability of IVF for couples who are trying to have a precious baby,"" he added. Earlier on Friday, in an apparent effort to ease concerns in the state, Alabama's Republican Attorney General Steve Marshall said he did not intend to prosecute IVF providers or their families. Mr Trump's comments were his first on the issue, and signalled his opposition to a ruling which some Republicans fear could harm them electorally by hindering plans to win back suburban women as well as swing voters. Mr Trump is the front-runner to win the Republican nomination for November's election and arguably the leading voice in the party.  In a further sign of the party's efforts to distance itself from the Alabama ruling, the National Republican Senate Committee, which helps members get elected to Congress, sent out a memo to candidates on Friday which directed them to express support for IVF and ""campaign on increasing access"" to the treatment.  ""There are zero Republican Senate candidates who support efforts to restrict access to fertility treatments,"" the committee's executive director, Jason Thielman, wrote in the memo which was obtained by the BBC's US partner, CBS. The memo also cited internal polling conducted by Kellyanne Conway, a one-time White House adviser to Mr Trump, to show access to IVF is overwhelmingly popular. A number of Senate candidates, including Kari Lake in Arizona, came out to publicly support access to the treatment after the memo was circulated. Mr Trump's only challenger for the Republican nomination, Nikki Haley, initially appeared to back the ruling after she said she considers frozen embryos to be babies. She later denied that she supported the court's decision. While the Alabama ruling does not ban or restrict IVF, several medical providers in the state cited fears of legal repercussions as they paused fertility services in recent days. It was made by the state's Supreme Court and all of its justices are Republican. Democrats are already incorporating the Alabama case into campaigning, portraying it as a warning that their rivals will seek to chip away at women's rights if they win in the November election. Mr Biden said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that the Alabama decision was only possible because of the 2022 ruling by the US Supreme Court - which has three Trump appointees - to nullify abortion rights. While many conservatives celebrated the end of Roe v Wade, it proved a potent get-out-the-vote motivator for Democrats and a messaging nightmare for Republicans.

BBCNews_12,"Northern Ireland's post-primary schools have been given guidance on how to deliver classes on sex education. They must teach about access to abortion and prevention of early pregnancy, under new regulations introduced last year. The Department of Education (DoE) held a public consultation which would influence under what circumstances a pupil might be removed. A total of 13,461 responses were received with over 25,000 comments. Before the new policy, each school in Northern Ireland has been required to teach relationships and sex education (RSE) but the curriculum has been a matter for each school to decide, based on their school ethos. That approach has previously been criticised by some experts, who have said it leads to ""different and inconsistent learning experiences"" for pupils. However, the move by NI Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris means post-primaries would have to teach pupils about issues such as how to prevent a pregnancy, the legal right to an abortion in Northern Ireland and how relevant services may be accessed. The guidance states a pupil in years eight, nine, 10 and 11 may be excused if a parent, who considers the education against their wishes, makes a written request to a school. If a parent makes a request for their child in Year 12 to be removed from part or specified elements of the programme, it must be confirmed the pupil does not object to being excused. The guidance also points to the social and emotional effects of being excluded, as well as the likelihood of a child hearing their peers' version of what was taught and discussed second-hand. However it is noted that any detrimental effects may be mitigated if the parents propose delivering the specific education to their child at home instead.  The guidance further notes that the change to the curriculum made by the Northern Ireland secretary does not prevent teachers and pupils from discussing and commenting on the moral, ethical or spiritual issues which may arise in relation to matters such as abortion. A Department of Education spokesperson said the guidance follows the wording in the regulations brought by Mr Heaton-Harris, and the ability to excuse pupils from receiving the education required is not the same as the rest of the UK. BBC News NI understands that in England, a principal can override the wishes of the parent if they deem it necessary. The Department of Education has also released a number of the comments made in the consultation.  One parent said: ""It is vital that pupils are taught accurate and appropriate information regarding these topics. ""I believe that pupils absolutely should know how to prevent early pregnancy and access abortions."" A school leader commented: ""Children are and should be just that - children.  ""When we consider that they cannot vote until a certain age then why should being taught about such issues be any different?"" The highest number of responses were from parents at 47.16%, followed by members of the public at 32.48%. The Education Authority will provide training for teachers and board of governors in respect of the new requirements. CCEA will also release documents to help address sensitive issues with pupils. There is also guidance on external providers who would come in to help with RSE.  Teachers will have to co-design and participate in those lessons. The guidance states external providers shouldn't substitute teaching but should enhance or supplement it.  The school must also be satisfied with the quality of what is being brought into the classroom. Dr Graham Gault, director of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) in Northern Ireland, said the department has engaged ""very well"" with unions when constructing the guidance. But he added that the ""proof would be in the pudding"" in how easy and workable it is for parents and young people to decide not to access the lessons. ""I imagine there will be things that will need to be improved in the guidance over time and the department, I hope, will remain open to looking at that as time goes on,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme. The Northern Ireland Secretary said he recognised that some parents may either wish to teach their child about sex education, or make alternative arrangements based on religion or age. ""The regulations therefore placed a duty on the Department of Education to ensure that a pupil may be withdrawn from education on sexual and reproductive health and rights or elements of that education, at the request of a parent,"" a statement said. Millennium Integrated Primary near Saintfield is one of 10 schools no longer receiving new buildings. Dr Graham Gault says it will take a generation to fix educational underfunding in Northern Ireland. The £11m shared campus caters for pupils from both Limavady High School and St Mary's High School. A pause in funding for new-build projects has been lifted for schools in the worst condition. Union leaders had been making plans for three more days of strike action before Easter.

BBCNews_13,"Almost a year before Americans head to the polls for the 2024 presidential election, two prominent political fighters - a Democrat and a Republican - are squaring off on the debate stage. It may not be next year's title card - that's Donald Trump and Joe Biden who are seemingly heading toward a 2020 rematch. But these contestants, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and California Governor Gavin Newsom, make Thursday night's showdown an interesting contrast - and perhaps a preview of political battles to come. The made-for-television event is the result of months of verbal sparring - and a cable news network and a conservative talking head, Sean Hannity, eager to offer a platform for the duel. As the two men face off, let's look at the tale of the tape. In one corner, lacing up his thick-heeled boots, is Ron DeSantis.  Once thought to be a top contender for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, he has fallen on hard times, sagging in the polls and cutting his campaign spending as donor contributions taper off. This debate offers him the opportunity to set himself apart from his Republican rivals, including former President Donald Trump, by demonstrating he has the composure and strength to go toe-to-toe with the Democrats. Across the ring, slicking back his well-coiffed hair and getting his game face on, is Gavin Newsom.  He won his first governor's race in 2018, the same year as Mr DeSantis, and his political career has followed a similar upward trajectory. Mr Newsom may not be running for president this year, due to there being a Democratic president running for re-election, but he clearly harbours White House ambitions.  One way or another, the 2028 Democratic nomination fight is going to be an open contest, and Mr Newsom could use this debate - along with other spotlight-grabbing opportunities - to burnish his credentials as a party standard-bearer. This isn't the first TV sparring match between two political heavyweights. In 2017, Senators Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz - runners-up for their respective party's presidential nominations the previous year - twice met in front of the cameras in what felt like an alternate presidential contest. When Mr Newsom and Mr DeSantis tap gloves on Thursday night, however, the two men not only represent their party's ideological differences, they also stand as the leaders of two states that have most clearly put those political philosophies into effect. Both California and Florida are at the top of the rankings in population (first and third) and economic muscle (first and fourth).  They're also single-party fiefdoms. Democrats control California, including all statewide offices, and Florida is similarly under Republican domination. During the Trump presidency, California was held up as the liberal counterpoint - a land that offered an alternative to the right-wing populism on the ascent in Washington.  That script flipped when Mr Biden took over and ""the free state of Florida"", as Mr DeSantis put it, became the conservative alternative to the Democrats' liberal national government. Although both Mr DeSantis and Mr Newsom have national political aspirations, they both also have records to tout - and defend - in their home states. Mr Newsom will be able to point to California's broad range of liberal social policies - including a robust social safety net that includes healthcare and aid to the poor, gun-control, openness to immigrants, and gay and transgender protections.  He will also have to account for his state's high income taxes, a growing homeless problem and an uptick in crime in its major cities. For his part, Mr DeSantis has pushed for a broad range of conservative policies in Florida, particularly this year, as he geared up for his presidential bid.  The state has enacted a six-week ban on abortions, loosened restrictions on carrying firearms in public, limited how teachers can discuss gay and transgender issues in public-school classrooms, and invalidated out-of-state driving licences issued to undocumented migrants.  The governor will have to explain, however, a higher-than-average poverty rate, spiralling housing and insurance prices, and criticism that his education policies are infringing on free speech. The Covid pandemic offered a dramatic contrast between the two governors' philosophies, as California closed schools, shuttered businesses for an extended duration and imposed mask and vaccine mandates, while Florida reversed its earlier mitigation efforts much more quickly. The winner of this debate might be the man best able to play defence on his record while also landing political punches on his opponent. While the two combatants may appear evenly matched on paper, the importance of the evening for each is far from balanced. Mr Newsom has a long runway to ramp up a possible 2028 presidential bid. While a good performance may help elevate him in the eyes of Democrats, anything less is unlikely to linger in their memory.  That is hardly the case for Mr DeSantis, who will be judged by Republican voters much sooner, starting in Iowa in mid-January.  Over the course of the Republican primary debates, he has offered competent yet bland performances, doing little to elevate himself in the eyes of conservatives.  While he has another party debate next week, this may be the Florida governor's best chance to change the trajectory of a presidential campaign that not only trails Mr Trump by a wide margin but is also in danger of ceding second place to former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley. What's more, this contest is hosted by Sean Hannity on conservative Fox News - and should be friendly terrain for the Republican.  While Mr Newsom will get credit just for showing up, and there will be fewer Democrats watching if he messes up, Mr DeSantis will be performing squarely in front of the kind of voters who will decide his fate in the coming months. Mr Newsom may be facing a fighter with his back to the wall - which can be a combustible situation. At the very least, it should make for entertaining viewing.

BBCNews_14,"Evidence of widespread abuse and torture by the founder of one of the world's biggest Christian evangelical churches has been uncovered by the BBC. Dozens of ex-Synagogue Church of all Nations members - five British - allege atrocities, including rape and forced abortions, by Nigeria's late TB Joshua. The allegations of abuse in a secretive Lagos compound span almost 20 years. The Synagogue Church of All Nations did not respond to the allegations but said previous claims have been unfounded. TB Joshua, who died in 2021, was a charismatic and hugely successful preacher and televangelist who had an immense global following.  The BBC's findings over a two-year investigation include:  One of the victims, a British woman, called Rae, was 21 years old when she abandoned her degree at Brighton University in 2002 and was recruited into the church. She spent the next 12 years as one of Joshua's so-called ""disciples"" inside his maze-like concrete compound in Lagos. Disciples: The Cult of TB Joshua A shocking journey into a maze of manipulation and terrifying abuse perpetrated by one of the most powerful religious figures of the 21st Century Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK only) or on the BBC Africa YouTube channel (outside UK) ""We all thought we were in heaven, but we were in hell, and in hell terrible things happen,"" she told the BBC. Rae says she was sexually assaulted by Joshua and subjected to a form of solitary confinement for two years. The abuse was so severe, she says she attempted suicide multiple times inside the compound. The Synagogue Church of All Nations [Scoan] has a global following, operating a Christian TV channel called Emmanuel TV and social media networks with millions of viewers. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, tens of thousands of pilgrims from Europe, the Americas, South East Asia and Africa travelled to the church in Nigeria to witness Joshua performing ""healing miracles"". At least 150 visitors lived with him as disciples inside his compound in Lagos, sometimes for decades.  More than 25 former ""disciples"" spoke to the BBC - from the UK, Nigeria, US, South Africa, Ghana, Namibia and Germany - giving powerful corroborating testimony about their experiences within the church, with the most recent experiences in 2019. Many victims were in their teens when they first joined. In some of the British cases, their transport to Lagos was paid for by Joshua, in co-ordination with other UK churches. Rae and multiple other interviewees compared their experiences to being in a cult. Jessica Kaimu, from Namibia, says her ordeal lasted more than five years. She says she was 17 when Joshua first raped her, and that subsequent instances of rape by TB Joshua led to her having five forced abortions while there. ""These were backdoor type… medical treatments that we were going through… it could have killed us,"" she told the BBC.  Other interviewees say they were stripped and beaten with electrical cables and horse whips, and routinely denied sleep. On his death in June 2021, TB Joshua was hailed as one of the most influential pastors in African history. Rising from poverty, he built an evangelical empire that counted dozens of political leaders, celebrities and international footballers among his associates. He did, however, attract some controversy during his lifetime when a guesthouse for church pilgrims collapsed in 2014, killing at least 116 people. The BBC's investigation, which was carried out with international media platform openDemocracy, is the first time multiple former church insiders have come forward to speak on the record. They say they've spent years trying to raise the alarm, but have effectively been silenced. A number of our witnesses in Nigeria claim they were physically attacked, and in one case shot at, after previously speaking out against the abuse and posting videos containing allegations on YouTube. A BBC crew that attempted to record footage of the church's Lagos compound from a public street in March 2022 was also fired at by the church's security, and was detained for a number of hours. The BBC contacted Scoan with the allegations in our investigation. It did not respond to them, but denied previous claims against TB Joshua. ""Making unfounded allegations against Prophet TB Joshua is not a new occurrence… None of the allegations was ever substantiated,"" it wrote. Four of the British citizens who spoke to the BBC say they reported the abuse to the UK authorities after escaping the church. They say no further action was taken. In addition, a British man and his wife emailed eyewitness accounts of their ordeal and video evidence - including recordings of being held at gunpoint by men describing themselves as police who are also members of Scoan - to the British High Commission in Nigeria in March 2010 after fleeing the church. In his email, the man said his wife had been repeatedly sexually assaulted and raped by Joshua. He warned the commission that other British nationals were still inside the compound facing atrocities. He also says no action was taken. The UK Foreign Office did not respond to these claims, but told the BBC that it takes all reports of crime, including sexual assault and violence against British nationals overseas, very seriously. Scoan continues to thrive today, under the leadership of Joshua's widow, Evelyn. In July 2023, she led a tour of Spain. Anneka, who left Derby in the UK to join Scoan at the age of 17, told the BBC she believes there are many other victims who have yet to speak out. She hopes further steps will be taken to uncover Joshua's actions.  ""I believe the Synagogue Church of All Nations needs a thorough investigation into why this man was able to function for so long the way he did,"" she said.

BBCNews_15,"Women waiting too long for NHS gynaecological treatments end up having potentially avoidable major surgery, a retired teacher has said. Anne Donnelly, 43, had an operation for endometriosis two years ago and is awaiting physiotherapy. A major review of gynae services said health trusts need to re-prioritise those waiting over a year for surgery.  The Department of Health said the report recognised ""unacceptably high"" waiting times. It added that the department would work to progress the recommendations, but that some will require ""additional investment"" which could impact delivery.   The review found that more than 37,000 women were on hospital waiting lists in Northern Ireland with 5% of those waiting nearly three years for treatment. Anne Donnelly, from County Tyrone, was diagnosed with endometriosis at the age of 22, after years of attending various GPs, specialists and a psychologist. ""I went from being a bubbly, active, outgoing 15-year-old to overnight having a debilitating pain that restricted my life and eventually led to me abandoning sport and Irish dancing. Endometriosis takes over every part of your life.  ""It is excruciatingly painful, it is like someone is sticking a knife into you; it takes the breath from you. I'm still shocked that we have to fight seven, eight, nine, 10 years before we are taken seriously,"" Anne said.   She said women feel ""abandoned"" by the NHS, with some having their bowels or womb removed as disease, such as hers, spreads. The review of gynaecology was conducted by the Getting it Right First Time (GIRFT) team, an external organisation on behalf of the NHS. The team spent a week last year visiting the five Northern Ireland health and social care trusts. Dysmenorrhoea, endometriosis, incontinence, hysterectomy, prolapse and urinary tract infections are among the conditions covered by gynae services. Waiting lists for these conditions are the worst in Northern Ireland and also when compared to similar lists in other parts of the UK. The review recommends: The review makes recommendation for each health trust. Among Belfast's 18 recommendations was that it should ""urgently develop an improvement strategy to address the outpatient and surgical waiting lists and include the introduction of a surgical robotic programme, similar to what exists in England"".   It added that an action plan should be developed within one month of receiving the report.   The Southern Health Trust was advised to open a dedicated female surgical ward for gynaecology, breast, and female urology patients with a minimum of two protected beds for each specialty. In relation to the Northern Trust, the report suggested promoting the Causeway Hospital's gynaecology unit as the main elective day case hub.  There were 17 recommendations for the Western Trust, including creating a dedicated gynaecology/women's health unit and to commission an abortion MVA service.  It also noted action was needed to resolve the ""issue of Swah consultants leaving"" for the Southern Trust.  In the South Eastern Trust, the suggestions included a need to develop Rapid Access Gynaecology Clinic for 10 sessions per week.  Earlier this year, the Department of Health confirmed the decision to permanently move maternity services from Causeway to Antrim Area Hospital. The report suggested a similar consideration be made to maternity services at Swah and Daisy Hill, where ""a similar move to centralise services would free up clinical time and space for other elective women's services"". Anne Donnelly is now awaiting an MRI and physiotherapy treatment. She said in the past 30 years, little has changed around gynaecological services.   Like most women in her position, she was told that painful periods were ""normal"".  ""We are ignored and it's not good enough anymore,  I am still facing the same discrimination because I am a woman, I am still facing the same comments about periods and endometriosis,"" Anne said. ""How can a young woman, at 43 with three kids, a teacher be left abandoned by the NHS and the government because we didn't have a government or leaders making decisions?"" she said. The victims were killed in separate, unrelated incidents in the Austrian capital on Friday. The dress is included in an exhibition at Leeds' Thackray Museum of Medicine. Data shows half of the referrals in 2023 resulted in no treatment. Women take part despite some in the community suggesting it should remain a men-only event. Plans for the doctors' regulator to license less-qualified health workers are under attack. Copyright 2024 BBC.

BBCNews_16,"Chileans have rejected a new constitution proposed by conservative delegates that would have affected laws in areas including abortion access, the ability to strike and rights for indigenous people.  The new charter would have replaced the current one written during the military regime of Gen Augustine Pinochet.  In a referendum on Sunday, the draft was reject by 56% of voters to 44%.  Voters had already rejected a progressive draft last year.  Efforts to replace Chile's existing constitution, adopted in 1980 under the Pinochet dictatorship, began in 2019 following anti-government demonstrations.  The protesters - many of them left-wing students - called for measures to address inequality and the cost of living crisis, as well as social and political reforms.  After weeks of unrest, the conservative president at the time, Sebastián Piñera, agreed to launch a process to rewrite Chile's constitution.  The first draft, written by a body of 155 elected members, proposed reforms to Chile's senate as well as formal recognition of the country's indigenous groups, but was rejected by 62% of voters in September last year.  The version voted on in Sunday's referendum was written by a new body of 51 elected representatives, 23 of whom were from the right-wing Republican Party. Among the criticisms made by left-wing opponents were that it failed to protect indigenous rights, could have allowed restrictions to reproductive rights, and enshrined private sector participation in the provision of services such as health, education, and pensions. Chilean President Gabriel Boric, who backed the first draft but remained neutral on the second, said ahead of the vote that it would be the last attempt at constitutional reform. On Sunday, he reiterated the message, saying: ""With this... the constitutional process is closed. There are other urgent matters. ""Our country will continue with the current constitution, because after two plebiscites on proposed constitutions, neither managed to represent or unite Chile in its beautiful diversity.""

BBCNews_17,"At 89 years old, feminist icon, writer and magazine editor, Gloria Steinem has no plans to retire from a long career of challenging the status quo. It's over 50 years since the political activist masterminded the Women's Action Alliance. It was a group dedicated to fighting sexism, and Steinem - one of three co-founders - became the face of the women's liberation movement in the United States for the rest of the 20th Century.  She started her career as a journalist in New York in the 1970s and went on to co-found Ms. magazine, one of the first publications to focus on other women's issues than the perils of housekeeping and the mandates of the beauty industry. In her apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side there's evidence of a life lived on the road, with artefacts from places she's visited adorning every surface. But these days she is mostly settled in New York, ""happy to be in my neighbourhood,"" she says. ""I'm still, now, hyper-conscious of how great it is to be here."" The apartment serves as the headquarters of her foundation, Gloria's Foundation, and as a place for women, journalists, activists and community leaders to gather now that she is at home more often. Gloria Steinem has been named one of the BBC's 100 Women for 2023.   During the 1970s, Gloria Steinem was one of the main voices campaigning for women's reproductive rights. She celebrated the US Supreme Court's 1973 ruling in the case of Roe v Wade, which granted women the constitutional right to abortion. Nearly half a century later she witnessed the reversal of this decision - the Supreme Court's historic ruling in June last year that ended the nationwide right to abortion. For Steinem and other pro-choice activists it was a stark reminder of the need to keep campaigning, to achieve changes she says she hopes to see in her lifetime. ""The most obvious and simplest [change] is that we can determine the fate of our own physical selves, so we can decide whether and when to have children, not to have children… whatever it is about our physical selves. ""That's where our difficulty begins, because we happen to have wombs and there is a desire to control wombs that is very central to authoritarian systems. Clearly, because we have a womb and men don't, the desire to control the womb is often the most lethal kind of effort."" As women's access to reproductive rights has become more limited in the US, some women in Latin America have successfully campaigned for the right to legal abortion and Steinem, who has been at the front line of countless street demonstrations in her life, admires their determined activism. ""Using our voices, protesting with our bodies, supporting other women is what the revolution is all about,"" she says. ""Reproductive freedom is basic, maybe more basic than freedom of speech."" With five decades of advocacy behind her, Steinem is in a unique position to reflect on the progress women have made.  In the US one major step forward has been an increase in the proportion of women turning out to vote, she points out. Other benchmarks are directly related to the family and the daily life of women, she says. ""Some are very domestic. Who is raising the children? Who is making dinner? Who is doing the dishes? That's crucial. ""There has been progress, just not enough,"" she says.  Steinem closely monitors the pressure on women's rights across the world, including the curtailment of freedoms in countries like Iran and Afghanistan. She regards the protests by Iranian women - who took to the streets burning their hijabs and chanting ""Woman, Life, Freedom"", after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in the custody of Iran's morality police - as both a battle for self-determination and a form of feminist revolution. ""They are fighting for the idea that a woman's body is not shameful or to be restricted, just as men's bodies are not, so whether they use the word 'feminism' or not, is up to them,"" Steinem says. ""Some people say 'women power', or 'women's liberation'. It's up to us."" The intersection of gender and race has always been the focus of Gloria Steinem's work. In the 1970s she worked closely with black political activist Angela Davis.  A photo of Steinem and fellow feminist Dorothy Pitman Hughes standing shoulder to shoulder with their fists in the air became an iconic image of the fight by women and African Americans for equality and social justice.  Yet many around the world have criticised Western feminism for not being inclusive enough. ""That's probably true,"" says Steinem. ""I mean, we're dealing with racism in this country. We have always generally tried to say, 'OK, if the group we're starting with doesn't look like the country, then we should wait until it does.' You know, to do our best to represent all the women who are affected by a particular issue."" Steinem remembers the days in which hand-outs and calls to action were made on a primitive duplicating machine called a mimeograph. She has now embraced the opportunities to connect remotely, fostered by the pandemic, and to reach a wider audience using the internet and social media. ""The problem with the internet is that it's discriminatory, because not everyone can afford to have a computer or understands the technology or knows how to express themselves on the web. And that's worrisome,"" she says. Even more so, she adds, ""since probably men have more access to technology than women do"". Steinem also expresses concern about cancel culture, and the impact on younger generations and social media users. She tells BBC 100 Women she hasn't experienced it herself but resents it on behalf of anybody who has, ""because free speech is crucial to any democracy"". ""We should not submit to cancel culture, it's social pressure as censorship, and it's definitely not a good thing even when it is suppressing evidence of bias. It still is silencing people."" Some might argue that one of the shortcomings of feminism has been its inability to help men navigate change as gender roles are redefined. For Gloria Steinem though, it is not women's responsibility to ""make [men] their revolution and their dinner"". That some men reject feminism should be expected, she says, as it is not beneficial for those ""using masculinity to dominate"". She believes change has to start from within our own homes. ""That's where a lack of democracy begins, and that's the beginning of the change that we all can make,"" she says. Days are busy at the Steinem house and foundation. There are books she needs to sign and meetings she needs to attend. As she sits at a table in the corner of her living room signing posters for an event, the doors of her apartment swing open and two women walk in. ""It is just great to be home more,"" Steinem repeats. She gets up to join them on the other side of the room.   ""I turned my living room into a place for talking circles. You know, revolution is like a liquid that's being poured into different containers. It changes its form, but it's still the same liquid."" Video filmed by Andrew Blum.

BBCNews_18,"Colorado's top court has ruled that Donald Trump cannot run in the state's Republican primary election.  Its ruling said the former president's actions before the Capitol Riot in 2021 amounted to insurrection, and disqualified him from the contest under the 14th Amendment.  We asked US voters what they made of the decision, and whether the courts should have any role in deciding who appears on presidential ballots.  Rom has been a loyal supporter of Donald Trump and voted for him in both the 2016 and 2020 elections. It is unfathomable to me how this state Supreme Court concluded that Donald Trump is disqualified from appearing on the ballot, even under the 1860's law. Mr Trump has not been convicted of insurrection, and he has not even been charged with insurrection. I believe it reveals how desperate Democrats are to stop Mr Trump, as well as how scared they are of him. To rely on a law from the 1860's intended to punish those who supported the Confederacy to stop Donald Trump reveals the extent of their desperation and the level to which they are willing to stoop.  For a party that claims it is trying to save democracy, in my opinion they are the antithesis of democracy.  Karen Kemp-Prosterman says protecting democracy and ensuring voting rights are her most important voting issues. I am pleased to finally see the judicial system embracing the clear threat of having a former president who provided comfort and aide to insurrectionists, as well engaged in active steps to delay congress in their official role. I do believe the current situation our country finds itself in, is one in which citizens must choose to recognise the danger of re-electing Mr Trump. What happens to the current rule of law as we know it? What happens to global ties? And what about the significant impact on the health of democracy? We already exist with rules and regulations that prohibit certain individuals from being eligible for electoral positions, therefore the precedent being set in Colorado is not an extreme position but one that finally addresses the current predicament the former president cultivated. Crystal Myers-Barber has been vocal about her support for Donald Trump. She voted for him in 2016 and 2020. I have tried to avoid being drawn into the drama, simply because this bad decision will be appealed. At this stage, nobody has been able to prove that Donald Trump did anything wrong on 6 January, so there is no reason to keep him off the ballot. I do not think a court should decide on who appears on a ballot, it is up to the voters! It's very simple. Let the people decide by their votes. We know Trump will be back on the ballot in Colorado, and he could even capitalise on the judges' poor decision by raising more money from supporters. Sandra's key issues are reproductive rights and gun control. She is worried by the prospect of Trump returning to the White House. My first response when I read about the Colorado verdict was 'it's about damn time'.  It's been so distressing, having an entire segment of the country acting like Donald Trump is eligible to run again. Mr Trump opposed a peaceful transition of power, in direct violation of the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution. I'm hoping other states will step up and exclude him from their 2024 ballots as well. I know the decision to include or exclude will ultimately rest with the Supreme Court, and I don't have a lot of faith in our Supreme Court because it's obviously compromised. Kathleen McClellan is a strong anti-abortion voter and backed Donald Trump twice.  My concern with the Colorado decision is that the make-up of the court - appointed entirely by Democratic governors -  could suggest that it is politically influenced.  And even if there's an actual legal issue impeding someone's eligibility to be on the ballot and the courts strike them off, in most states voters could just write them in anyway.  I had been hoping that both parties would give younger candidates a chance this time around. If Mr Trump is nominated I'll vote for him, but I'd really prefer someone like Governor Ron DeSantis. The man who burned himself in Washington DC is an active-duty US airman, local media report. After Alabama rules that frozen embryos are children, some fertility patients pray that lawmakers find a solution. The former president moves closer to the Republican nomination with a huge win in his rival's home state. Trump celebrated ""Republican unity"" after winning the South Carolina primary - but his rival is staying in the race. The US says the allies targeted 18 sites, including missile storages, drones and radars. Copyright 2024 BBC.

BBCNews_19,"Legal ambiguity over abortions in Kenya is pushing thousands of women to turn to backstreet clinics. BBC Africa Eye explores how abortion is shrouded in stigma and misinformation. Edith is lying on a bed covered in old newspaper in a backstreet clinic in Nairobi.  Her legs are held high by stirrups while a man in a white medical coat explains he is about to put some medicine inside her uterus. A red bucket of bleach containing medical instruments sits on the floor.   The mum-of-three, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, is four months pregnant and is about to have an abortion.    ""I had to terminate because I had to go back to work, and I have another small baby,"" she later tells BBC Africa Eye.   Abortion is a complicated issue in Kenya.    The penal code, which has its origins in the colonial era, outlaws abortion, criminalising the woman, the person who carries out the abortion and the person who supplies the material required.   However, the 2010 constitution, combined with a wider body of law, does allow abortion when ""the life or health of the mother is in danger"" or when the pregnancy has resulted from rape or incest. Edith discovered she was HIV-positive a few years ago. Her partner, after refusing to get tested himself, later left her. A lawyer told the BBC that having a child while living with HIV meant ""her physical wellbeing is probably in danger"". This, as well as other factors, meant that Edith may have qualified for a legal abortion.   But she felt the backstreet clinic was her only choice.   Few doctors providing legal abortions are willing to talk about the issue openly.    High-profile arrests over the years have made the situation ""dangerous for health workers"", according to Prof Joachim Osur, a reproductive and sexual health expert at Amref International University in Nairobi. It is about how the law is understood.   ""Depending on how the judge interprets the legality of the procedure that someone has done, it can go either way,"" he says.   In 2004, Dr John Nyamu, along with two nurses, was arrested for the murder of two foetuses, a crime that carried the death penalty.    He was held at the Kamiti Maximum Security Prison in Nairobi for 12 months before he was found not guilty.   The media sensation in Kenya around his case eventually led to the formation of the Reproductive Health and Rights Alliance. It was this group that led the debate to help draft the 2010 constitution, which for the first time in the country's history provided a legal, albeit limited, avenue for abortion.  However, Dr Nyamu, who now provides safe and legal abortions, believes that the legal ambiguity over abortion makes it hard for women to access these services, even when they should be allowed and particularly in public health facilities.   ""Unsafe abortion is rampant in Kenya,"" he says, arguing that poor women suffer the most as safe terminations are not available in public hospitals because of the uncertainty and lack of guidelines. The unsafe abortions they then seek can lead to health problems.   ""The ones who come with the post-abortion complications, most of them are young people…. The women actually start [the procedure] themselves, or they do it with assistance of an untrained person,""  Dr Nyamu adds.   According to the global human rights organisation, Center for Reproductive Rights, around seven women and girls die every day in Kenya because of unsafe abortions. Thousands more are hospitalised.  At an unregulated clinic on the outskirts of Nairobi, the man in charge offers women abortions for 2,500 Kenyan shillings ($16; £13).   ""We have girls who are still going to school. You get others who are raped.   ""You get someone who is not ready, and they want to terminate it. We do help because they come for help. They need that help from us,"" he says, speaking on condition of anonymity.   He charges extra for the safe disposal of the foetus. If the woman cannot afford that he pays someone to throw it in the river.   Anti-abortion campaigners and associated religious organisations in Kenya, many of whom are supported by the anti-abortion lobby in the United States, insist the law is clear: abortion is illegal.  Charles Kanjama, chairperson of the Kenya Christian Professionals Forum, regularly speaks out against abortion and organises rallies in Nairobi.   ""For us, we don't think there is any contradiction. We think [the penal code and the constitution] are aligned. I do not support an amendment of our laws to remove the crime of abortion,"" he says.   In 2012, the government published guidelines for health workers on legal abortions. A year later they were withdrawn, and training on safe abortion care was suspended. That remains the case and Mr Kanjama's group wants it to stay that way.   ""Our position is that whether abortion is safe or unsafe, first of all, the child always dies. So, it is always unsafe for the child. And number two, you cannot train people to do something that is illegal in the country.""   There are many leading voices in Kenya who disagree. MP Esther Passaris not only speaks out in favour of abortion but is pushing for improved sexual health and family planning education too.  ""Our constitution allows abortion only when the wellbeing of the mother is in question, and the wellbeing is not just physical and biological, it's emotional and economical.    ""I think it's about time that we understand the emotional burden of not having access to family planning, not empowering the woman so that she knows that she doesn't have to become a baby-producing machine.""  Ms Passaris says that while the 2010 constitution legalised abortion in certain circumstances, she argues that the fear around it restricts women's access to health services, particularly for those from poorer communities.   ""The rich have an opportunity to take their children to five-star hospitals and procure a safe abortion, silently, without anyone knowing or speaking. But the poor have to struggle,"" she says.   In March 2022, Kenya's High Court affirmed abortion as a fundamental right under the terms of constitution and ruled that arbitrary arrests were illegal, but it has done little to allay the fears of some women, like Edith.  Back in the clinic where she is seeking a termination, the man, who says he trained as a doctor and performs around 150 abortions a month, has finished putting the medicine inside her to induce an abortion.  ""We have, like, four to five hours before the medicine starts taking action. But later, when hell breaks loose, she's going to experience the same thing people experience when giving birth,"" he says.   Edith saved up 4,000 Kenyan shillings for the abortion. It was not enough but the clinic agreed to do the procedure on condition she would pay more later.    A week after the abortion, Edith speaks to the BBC again, describing what it was like to get an abortion in secret.   ""I was alone and in so much pain that I was hitting the walls. I was wondering what was going on, if this was a birth. I was thinking: 'I don't want to die in this house alone.'   ""You do it in pain, because you did not expect something like that. You love children but considering the life you live, you have to do that.""

People pay their respects at the funeral of world record holder Kelvin Kiptum who died at 24. South Africans and Ethiopians are among those who will no longer have to pay a $30 fee to enter.

BBCNews_20,"An Alabama court ruling that frozen embryos created through fertility treatment are children has delivered an election-year opportunity for Democrats - and a political headache for Republicans.  US President Joe Biden's party is already campaigning on the controversy, casting November's vote as a fight over reproductive rights. For Republicans, the row could pose an obstacle in their carefully laid plans to win back suburban women and swing voters. At least three fertility clinics in Alabama have paused in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) since last week's ruling. The all-Republican justices decided that frozen embryos created through IVF are considered children under state law. While the ruling does not ban or restrict IVF, several medical providers in the state cited fears of legal repercussions as they paused fertility services in recent days. On Thursday President Biden sought to blame the ruling on his predecessor and likely Republican challenger in this year's election, Donald Trump. Mr Biden said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that the Alabama decision was only possible because of the 2022 ruling by the US Supreme Court - which has three Trump appointees - to nullify abortion rights. While many conservatives celebrated the end of Roe v Wade, it proved a potent get-out-the-vote motivator for Democrats and a messaging nightmare for Republicans. Mr Biden's party will be hoping the Deep South fallout over IVF will prove as energising for their electoral base as the abortion issue. Democrats are already depicting the Alabama case as what they see as a portent of further assaults on women's rights if their rivals make headway in the coming general election. US Vice-President Kamala Harris accused Republicans of hypocrisy during a stop on her ""Fight for Reproductive Freedoms"" tour in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on Thursday. ""On the one hand, the proponents are saying that an individual doesn't have a right to end an unwanted pregnancy and, on the other hand, the individual does not have the right to start a family,"" she told an audience. Forty-two percent of Americans have either used IVF treatments or known someone who did, according to a Pew Survey last year. That percentage rises with increased earnings - 45% among middle-income Americans and 59% for those with high-incomes. Those individuals are more likely to be white Americans who vote Republican, and many are ones whom Mr Trump is hoping to bring back into the political fold after losing their support in 2020.  The IVF controversy could well frustrate that effort. Shana Gadarian, a political science professor at Syracuse University, said: ""In other words, restricting IVF is going to be unpopular even among conservative and Republican voters and is an extreme position not shared by most Americans."" Mr Trump has so far stayed silent on the subject. Other Republican office-holders have either avoided the issue altogether, or steered a middle ground, distancing themselves from the few hardline conservatives who do support restricting access to fertility treatment and contraception. New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu, a moderate Republican, called the Alabama ruling ""scary"" while speaking at the Politico Governors Summit on Thursday. Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, a potential Trump running mate, said he had not ""studied the issue"" when pressed by reporters on Thursday.  Nikki Haley, Mr Trump's last challenger for the Republican White House nomination, initially agreed in the wake of the Alabama court ruling that ""embryos are babies"".  She backtracked slightly on Thursday, telling CNN that embryos should be protected, but that Alabama ""needs to go back and look at the law"". ""We don't want fertility treatments to shut down. We don't want them to stop doing IVF treatments,"" said Ms Haley, who used fertility treatments to have her two children. Even anti-abortion groups seemed torn on Thursday at the Conservative Political Action Conference, one of the largest annual gatherings of Republican voters.  Jessica Andreae, director of operations of the ProLove Ministries, told the BBC at the event near Washington DC that she agreed with the Alabama court that embryos should be considered human life, but added that it ""is a very complex issue for me"".  ""I have a friend who has two dear children through fertility treatment,"" she said. ""And any human life, however it's brought into this world, is a gift."" How Republicans manage that balancing act could prove decisive as the presidential election looms.  With additional reporting from Francesca Gillett  The man who burned himself in Washington DC is an active-duty US airman, local media report. After Alabama rules that frozen embryos are children, some fertility patients pray that lawmakers find a solution. The former president moves closer to the Republican nomination with a huge win in his rival's home state. The victims were killed in separate, unrelated incidents in the Austrian capital on Friday.

BBCNews_21,"A preacher who protested outside an abortion clinic has been convicted of breaching a protection order.  Stephen Green, 72, held a sign bearing a religious verse in a part of Ealing, west London, covered by a public spaces protection order (PSPO) last February.  Outside the MSI Reproductive Choices Clinic, it was the first such zone to be introduced in the UK. Green's conviction was welcomed by campaigners who said people were fed-up of seeing behaviour like his. Green was given a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £2,426 in costs and surcharge. His lawyer told Uxbridge Magistrates' Court on Thursday his client intended to appeal his conviction. Green, of Carmarthen in west Wales, held what was described in court as a ""large sign"" displaying the psalm text ""For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb"". He had pleaded not guilty and proclaimed his right to freedom of speech. District Judge Kathryn Verghis said he ""pointedly and intentionally"" included the words ""in my mother's womb"" as a protest. She said displaying those words outside an abortion clinic amounted to ""an expression of disapproval as envisaged by the order"". Judge Verghis accepted the protest had been peaceful, but attached ""great weight"" to the fact he could have protested in an area not covered by the order. The court heard clinic staff were diverted from their work to deal with the protest, and that residents challenged Green, but that there was no evidence of any clinic patients suffering. MSI Reproductive Choices spokeswoman, Louise McCudden, said: ""People are fed up with seeing behaviour like Stephen Green's in their communities, which is why Parliament voted to protect clinics across England and Wales."" She said the verdict showed national legislation must be implemented urgently so women can access abortion ""safe from harassment"". The conviction comes a day after Home Secretary James Cleverly said his department was listening to consultation responses supporting the introduction of ""safe access zones"" around abortion clinics. Campaigners want national legislation, saying PSPOs can result in a postcode lottery. In Parliament last year, MPs voted against attempts to allow ""silent prayer"" outside clinics under the new law. Proposed draft guidance states prayer itself within a zone ""should not automatically be seen as unlawful"", but added that ""where an individual is praying, but their conduct is also intrusive, this is likely to be an offence"". The challenge saw 27 groups walk across the capital, visiting all but one of London's Tube stations.

BBCNews_22,"A dog who found a permanent home after spending five years at an animal shelter will get his best Christmas this year, his new owner said.  Chase, a Malinois and German shepherd cross, was taken in by the Pact animal and wildlife sanctuary in Hingham, Norfolk, at the age of 20 months. Mike Palmer from Hellesdon, Norwich, said he ""felt a bond"" with Chase while volunteering at the centre. ""Essentially, he's the one rescuing me,"" Mr Palmer said. Several unsuccessful attempts were made by the PACT sanctuary to rehome Chase. Mr Palmer, a former civil servant who retired eight years ago due to treatment for a brain tumour, said he and his wife had lost their own dog in April. ""When I had brain surgery in 2015, I had to re-learn how to do everything again, so there's a path here that I can relate to,"" he said. ""After walking about 30m (98ft) or so, I just felt a bond."" He said Chase was now much calmer thanks to ""lots of love and attention"" - and long walks twice a day.  He said Christmas would see Chase very much included in the celebrations.  ""He'll probably get an extra juicy bone for Christmas and a decent walk,"" he said. ""It's a fine act being a doting father to a dog enjoying every day with us."" He said the animal rescue charity was also impressed with Chase's progress. Mr Palmer added: ""I have to get out of bed every day even when I might be feeling a little depressed, due to my brain injury. ""I have to because he needs the exercise and the fresh air helps my health too. He's made a massive difference.

BBCNews_23,"On Friday, activists assembled in Washington for the March for Life, the nation's largest annual anti-abortion rally.  The crowds were thinner than in past years, due in part to the cold temperatures and blowing snow that blanketed the capital overnight.  But the campaigners in attendance this year also acknowledged the more concerning headwinds facing their movement, now in an election year: a general public broadly supportive of abortion rights, and a Republican party increasingly hesitant to join the fight.  ""It is kind of discouraging,"" said Olivia Murphy, an activist from Virginia. ""Keeping the momentum up is definitely challenging.""  Four years earlier, Donald Trump had become the first and only sitting president to attend the March for Life. ""Unborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House,"" he said, pausing for applause.  Mr Trump soon delivered on that promise, helping to reshape the Supreme Court into the body that would overturn Roe v Wade in June 2022, rescinding the nationwide right to abortion. But in the 18 months since that generational victory in Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization, things have not gone quite as planned.  Instead, the anti-abortion movement has been stymied by mounting public support for reproductive rights, and a series of bruising electoral defeats. These challenges will soon collide with the presidential election, where abortion is expected to be a leading issue. Mr Trump - the likely Republican nominee - has begun his own retreat, calling for ""compromise"" from activists.  ""We want people in office to truly be on our side. It's a tough situation,"" Ms Murphy said. ""But we'll work with what we have.""  Last year, at the first march after Roe's demise, activists seemed triumphant.   In the immediate aftermath of Dobbs, Republican-controlled states moved swiftly to outlaw the procedure. Today, 21 states have either total or partial abortion bans on the books, with some including harsh punishments for doctors and others who assist in accessing the procedure, including jail time, steep fines, and the loss of medical licences.   But these anti-abortion policies incited fierce anger among broad sections of the American public, boosting support for reproductive rights. About 69% of voters think that abortion should be legal throughout the first three months of pregnancy - the period when most abortions occur - according to a recent Gallup poll. The survey marked a high watermark in support for pro-abortion activists.  And in the first year without Roe, the average number of monthly abortions rose, according to data released in October from a research group backed by the Society of Family Planning (SFP). Abortion bans have caused serious harm to families across the country, said David Cohen, a law professor at Drexel University and an abortion expert. ""But the anti-abortion movement would sure hope that they were accomplishing something more than some disruption."" ""They thought they were - to use their words - 'saving babies' and, on balance, they're not,"" he said, citing the SFP data.   For Republican politicians, anti-abortion policies have proven politically toxic.  Reproductive rights have won every abortion-related ballot measure over the last two years, even in Republican-controlled states. And abortion is thought to have handed Democrats a series of unexpected electoral wins, including the 2022 midterms, the Virginia state elections and the Wisconsin Supreme Court.  ""We're getting our butts kicked,"" said John Feehery, a Republican strategist. ""The politics of this are not awesome for Republicans right now.""  These results have spawned a growing unease among Republican lawmakers who fear the blowback of a strict anti-abortion stance.  In Congress, nearly three dozen House members who in 2021 signed a bill that recognised life at the moment of conception, have so far refused to sign on to nearly identical legislation crafted last year, a shift first reported by the New York Times. In the Senate, Republican Lindsey Graham's proposed anti-abortion legislation, a 20-week ban, was quickly shot down by members of his own party.   And Mr Trump, the overwhelming favourite to win the Republican presidential nomination, has done a partial about-face on the issue, dismissing the idea of a national ban - the ultimate goal for the anti-abortion movement - and calling for compromise.  ""We're living in a time when there has to be a little bit of a concession one way or the other,"" he said in a televised Fox News Town Hall last week. ""You have to win elections.""  At Friday's march, several campaigners said they were disappointed and angered by Mr Trump's words, and the apparent lack of ""moral courage"" on the issue of abortion in the Republican party.  We are Catholic first, we are pro-life first, Joshua Feibelman told the BBC. ""To the degree that politics aligns with those values, that's how we determine our vote.""   But just as many activists acknowledged that as the probable Republican nominee, Mr Trump would likely receive their vote anyway. These activists said they remained optimistic that if Mr Trump returned to the White House he would once again deliver for the anti-abortion cause.  ""The pro-life generation knows when November 2024 comes around there's only going to be one option,"" said Kristan Hawkins, president of the influential anti-abortion group Students for Life. ""The thing about President Trump is that he's a man that prides himself on making his deals and keeping his deals,"" Ms Hawkins said. ""He made a deal with the pro-life movement in 2016 and I'm holding him to that deal.""   The man who burned himself in Washington DC is an active-duty US airman, local media report. After Alabama rules that frozen embryos are children, some fertility patients pray that lawmakers find a solution.

BBCNews_24,"US Senator Tommy Tuberville has dropped his controversial 10-month hold on military promotions, a blockade that infuriated his fellow Republicans.  After ending his protest over the Pentagon's abortion access policy, the Senate on Tuesday afternoon voted to promote 425 military officers.  He released the hold after months of pressure from fellow Republicans, who said he had damaged national security.  But he insisted he would maintain the hold for the most senior promotions. For nearly a year, Mr Tuberville stalled military promotions to protest against a Pentagon policy created after the overturning last year of Roe v Wade, which had for decades granted US women abortion rights.  The Pentagon policy allowed service members time off and travel reimbursement for seeking abortions and fertility treatment. It reimburses members who had to travel to a state where abortion is not restricted.  During the 10-month campaign, approval of over half of the military's general and admiral positions was held up. At one point the Pentagon was forced to appoint acting heads of the Army, Navy and Marine Corps.  Mr Tuberville originally said he would only drop his hold if the Pentagon changed its policy, but there had been increasing pressure from both sides of the aisle to confirm officers. Typically, military confirmations are confirmed through unanimous consent to expedite the process.  ""I'm not going to hold the promotions of these people any longer,"" Mr Tuberville told reporters on Tuesday. ""We just released them - about 440 of them. Everybody but 10 or 11 four-stars.""  His fellow Republicans had become increasingly irate with Mr Tuberville's actions in recent weeks. But on Tuesday he defended his campaign.  ""It's been a long fight,"" Mr Tuberville said on Tuesday. ""We fought hard. We did the right thing for the unborn and for our military, fighting back against executive overreach."" Defence officials had also urged Mr Tuberville to drop his hold on senior military promotions.  ""In the end, this was all pointless,"" President Joe Biden said in a statement welcoming the promotion of scores of officers.  He said Mr Tuberville and Republicans had ""needlessly hurt"" hundreds of American troops, adding: ""I hope no-one forgets what he did."" White House spokesman John Kirby welcomed the move, but added that four-star generals and admirals must be urgently confirmed.  ""They're responsible for some very, very strategic issues around the world,"" he said. Mr Tuberville's fellow conservatives also breathed a sigh of relief. South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham said he was ""glad this has come to the end"". ""I agree with his concerns about the Pentagon policy of using taxpayer dollars to fund travel for abortions, but I think the blanket hold approach is really punishing people who had nothing to do with that,"" he told CNN. In November, his fellow Republicans took to the Senate floor in a five-hour confrontation over the hold, saying they agreed with his objection to the Pentagon policy, but said Mr Tuberville's actions would not resolve it.   The Senate will begin to consider a $95b package that does not include border security measures. Republicans blocked a sweeping immigration bill months in the making - but a back-up has been put forward. Bosses from five of the largest social media firms were grilled about how they are protecting children.

BBCNews_25,"Argentina's new far-right president has vowed to deliver economic ""shock treatment"" in his first speech after formally taking office. Javier Milei warned Argentines ""there is no money"" and recommitted to a programme of harsh austerity measures. The populist outsider won a surprise election victory in November with radical pledges to overhaul the South American nation's ailing economy. Mr Milei's inauguration was held in Buenos Aires on Sunday. In a day of pomp and ceremony, the 53-year-old capped his extraordinary rise to power with a speech which left Argentines in no doubt he intends to embark on an economic path unlike any previous president. He said he would undo ""decades of decadence"" with deep spending cuts, designed to slash huge public debts and drive down inflation, which is now higher than 140%. ""The bottom line is that there is no alternative to austerity and there is no alternative to shock treatment,"" Mr Milei said.  ""We know that in the short term the situation will worsen. But then we will see the fruits of our efforts.""   Mr Milei waved to supporters during a procession to the presidential palace alongside his sister Karina, the confidant who is expected to play an influential role behind the scenes in his new administration. He addressed the crowd and chanted campaign slogans from the balcony, and was presented with the blue and white presidential sash and baton - which he had personalised with engravings of his five dogs. Mr Milei has risen rapidly from relative obscurity to Argentina's highest office on a right-wing platform which includes restricting abortion rights, liberalising gun laws and climate change denial. He was frequently pictured wielding a chainsaw on the campaign trail, and his unflinching statements have been likened to former US President Donald Trump and former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. During the campaign he said he would replace Argentina's currency with the dollar and abolish the country's central bank, along with a host of government departments. But while the presidency comes with sweeping powers, Mr Milei will face political limitations as he attempts to fix a set of daunting problems. The peso - Argentina's embattled currency - is in long-term freefall, poverty levels have soared to 40% and, according to IMF data, the economy is in a deep recession. There is little doubt that Mr Milei has inherited an economy in crisis. What is not clear is whether he will continue along the path of radical solutions he proposed during his campaign or whether he will moderate his promises so as not to rock the boat. The new president will likely face opposition in Argentina's Congress, where the coalition of small right-wing and libertarian parties he leads has only minority representation.  Some observers have noted a more moderate tone since his victory was confirmed. However, hours into the job, the new president signalled he intends to govern as he campaigned by signing a decree to reduce the number of departments from 18 to nine, making good on a key pledge. Among the guests at the swearing-in ceremony was Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has met several Latin American leaders as he seeks to shore up global support for his country's war effort. The pair were pictured embracing and Mr Zelensky later told reporters they had discussed ways Argentina could support Ukraine. Hungary's President Viktor Orban - who Mr Milei has been likened to ideologically - was also in attendance. With the pomp and ceremony of the inauguration over, Argentines will now focus on how their new president approaches the job in practice.  And while Mr Milei was buoyed by the frustration of voters with previous administrations, he will now have to deliver to avoid disappointing those who backed him. His honeymoon period will likely be short.  Copyright 2024 BBC.

BBCNews_26,"A couple who have adopted three-year-old triplets said life had become ""much more amazing and stressful and fun"". Paul and Richard have spent years making Christmas special for their local community in Coventry, putting on spectacular light shows and raising more then £30,000 for charity. Now they are set to spend their first Christmas as an extended family after adopting the children in July.  ""It's changed the whole thing, it's going to be crazy,"" said Paul. ""We went into the adoption process not knowing what to expect, but it is almost like it was meant to be."" The couple said they had always wanted children but had not previously considered taking on three of them at once.  ""Last January I was looking through the online forum where details of the children were, when I spotted these triplets and thought there was no way would we get them, no way would we be able to help them,"" the 42-year-old electrician explained.  ""Unbeknown to me my other half Richard had also spotted them.""  He said they had talked through the decision, taking into consideration the cost and space in the house.  ""Everyone was saying how mad we were,"" said Paul, ""but every negative each of us brought up, one of us found a positive to overcome it. ""The way it has worked out has been absolutely amazing."" The process of applying to adopt had been ""gruelling,"" he added, ""but it's so rewarding, they're so adorable, they're just a joy to be around."" Richard, 39, described the adoption process as ""quite intense and very intrusive"" but said, now they were home and settled with the children, to have Christmas with their own little family was ""just beautiful"". Paul said the couple had been supported by the adoption agency and local authority. ""They've both been fully on board with us,"" he added. The couple were nominated for a BBC CWR Make A Difference Award for being good neighbours, for their annual Coundon Christmas light show.  Paul said he had first been inspired to put up decorations as a 12-year-old after spotting a neighbour's display. ""I bought some lights with my pocket money and stuck them in the tree,"" he said.  ""And each year it got bigger and bigger and the family started coming around, and then the neighbours."" About 500 people attended this year's lights switch-on, a first for their new family.  ""The music was playing and the lights were flashing, they took in the crowds and were excited,"" he said. ""But they just kept thinking it was their party and were so happy about that. ""I know we've given them a secure home for them to grow up in, but I think it's made our family complete by them being here - it's such a warm feeling.""

BBCNews_27,"They're calling it ""Sejmflix"". The daily livestream from Poland's parliament, the Sejm, has become an online hit, drawing hundreds of thousands of viewers for each session. Some top a million.  Soon the latest must-watch series will make the leap to the big screen. Demand to follow key proceedings next week is so high that one of Warsaw's main cinemas, Kinoteka, is showing the whole thing, offering politics with popcorn.  Monday is the deadline for Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki to present his cabinet for a vote of confidence by deputies.  If he fails to get enough support, as expected, parliament will move to approve a coalition government led by Donald Tusk which holds a majority of seats in the Sejm.  Barring any major surprise, Poland should have a new cabinet by mid-week.  The surge of public enthusiasm for tracking the ins-and-outs of political life follows an election in mid-October that saw a record turnout of over 70%.  Democracy is in vogue here, with women and young people particularly engaged. Many were motivated to vote by stark warnings from the opposition that Poland was backsliding on some of the basic principles of democracy, under a right-wing PiS (Law and Justice Party) government. The big one is the rule of law.  The EU is still withholding more than €30bn (£26bn; $32bn) in Covid recovery funds because of its concerns about the politicisation of Poland's courts. Donald Tusk and his coalition partners have promised to make restoring the system's independence a priority. But their ambitions have been stalled. PiS won more votes than any other party at the election, giving it a first shot at forming a government, and it's taking the maximum time permitted. But the populist party's eight years running Poland are drawing to a close. Piotr Gaciarek hopes that might mean he gets his job back. For two decades, the judge ruled on criminal cases, including murder and drug smuggling.  For the past two years he's been stuck in a small back office of the giant Warsaw District Court ""working with documents"", as he puts it.  He was suspended in late 2021 after issuing a legal assessment that a judge was not competent to rule because he'd been appointed after controversial reforms by the PiS government.  As well as being sent to a paperwork purgatory, Judge Gaciarek's salary was docked by 40%. His is not a lone case.  PiS argues that its reforms - which affect how judges are appointed and how they are disciplined - were about shaking up old elites and improving efficiency. But judges' groups talk instead of the politicisation of the judiciary and a campaign of harassment against those who speak out. ""Most cases are of no interest to the authorities: divorce, theft. But there are those where it's important how the judge rules: against critical journalists, opposition politicians, protesters,"" Judge Gaciarek argues.  ""They simply wanted to have their own judges, to influence decisions."" He was eventually reinstated, after a fight. But he's still not back in his old job. A letter he showed me from the court's president said he was too busy to be released from his current role, although he says he has about 15 minutes' administrative work a week. ""I'm so frustrated. Poland trained me to try the toughest criminal cases. This is a waste of a major resource."" The battle over the judiciary is costing Poland in other ways.  Without the EU recovery funds, analysts say the new government will struggle to meet promises on raising teachers' salaries, maintaining social spending and improving healthcare, as well as other issues important to voters.  Tusk's coalition has promised reforms to release the cash. But there's no concrete plan and the process is bound to be fraught.  At least 2,000 new judges have been appointed since the contentious reforms, and opinion on whether they should stay in post is divided. On top of that, PiS-friendly President Andrzej Duda is in office for another two years, with the power to veto any legislative changes.  ""But it has to be resolved,"" Judge Gaciarek insists. ""I compare it to going to the doctor and wondering if the surgeon is authorised to treat me. I have to trust that the judicial system is working legally."" Another headline promise from Team Tusk was a radical overhaul of state media, which it describes as a ""factory of lies and hatred"". Talk of a ""purge"" prompted prominent members of the conservative press to warn of attempts to ""completely eliminate free speech"". But under PiS, Poland has slumped in international rankings measuring press freedom.  Radio 357 is living proof of the changes.  The station was launched in January 2021 by staff who resigned or were sacked from public radio's Channel 3, or Trojka, in a battle over political interference.  The last straw was an attempt to ban a song criticising PiS party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski, which had surged to the top of the Trojka charts.  There were earlier warning signs. Pawel Soltys, now the boss of 357, describes publicly funded media today as a ""propaganda machine"". But he says the interference began as soon as PiS were first elected. Pawel was a journalist at Trojka back in 2016 when two news anchors were demoted to work in the archives, after reporting on anti-government protests.  He defended them, as their trade union representative, and was then sacked himself.  ""It was one of the first cases of political interference, but [then] it was getting worse and worse,"" Pawel told me, in the station's studios beneath a public library in a Warsaw suburb. ""It took a year, before the whole [public media] machine was running to support the government."" Entirely funded by listener donations, Radio 357 is mainly dedicated to music. But Pawel values the fact its news bulletins and current affairs show are free to cover whatever they want.  ""On public radio it's not that you can't mention an anti-government protest,"" he says. ""You just have to make sure to say there's a small crowd.""  Assuming Team Tusk eventually start work, the list of promises to fulfil is long.  Women's groups - and women voters - are among the many who will be watching closely, especially for reform of the abortion laws. Strajk Kobiet has led major protests against a near-total ban on terminations in Poland.  The group's founder, Marta Lempart, told the BBC she expects Donald Tusk to keep his campaign pledge and ""do everything possible for legalisation to happen,"" allowing abortion on demand up to 12 weeks. The group also wants an end to the harassment and prosecution of people who give advice to women seeking abortion abroad or provide morning-after pills. ""Young people and women brought victory to the government,"" Marta Lampart says, ""so they should not be cheated"".  ""That would be a clear signal not to engage anymore, ever."" For now, the engagement level is high. Kinoteka says all the free tickets for its screening of parliamentary proceedings on Monday have been snapped up. They are expecting a full house. The audience there, and across Poland, don't want to be disappointed.  The agreement aims to improve the sharing of information and expertise to tackle illegal migration. President Zelensky has said the protests show solidarity between Poland and Ukraine is waning. Lawmakers are set to investigate claims the former government snooped on the phones of its opponents.

BBCNews_28,"Christian campaigners have lost a legal challenge to an order banning prayers outside an abortion clinic. Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council imposed a ""safe zone"" in 2022 around the clinic in Bournemouth. Campaigners Livia Tossici-Bolt and Christian Concern argued the Public Spaces Protection Order was illegal. However, two High Court judges said any interference with human rights was justified by the ""legitimate aim"" of protecting the clinic's clients. From about 2017, the council received reports of ""alarm and distress"" caused by protesters outside the British Pregnancy Advisory Service clinic, the judges said. In October 2022, the authority introduced an order prohibiting prayer, sprinkling holy water and other activities within a defined area around the centre in Ophir Road. Ms Tossici-Bolt, from the group ""40 Days For Life"", and Christian Concern argued the order banned ""peaceful and lawful behaviour"". However Lord Justice Warby and Mrs Justice Thornton said there was evidence the protests had caused harm. They said: ""It is, in our judgment, naïve and simplistic to suggest that activities of this kind in this context cannot be considered 'detrimental'... just because they are silent."" The judges added: ""The protest activities described in the evidence, including silent prayer and the handing out of leaflets, were... outside a clinic to which women were resorting at particularly sensitive and difficult moments in their lives."" They said any interference with human rights was ""justified by the legitimate aim of protecting the rights of women attending the clinic, their associates and the staff"". Christian Concern said it would appeal against the ruling. A law to introduce buffer zones around abortion clinics in England and Wales was passed in May. However, the government has said it is launching a consultation on guidance before the buffer zones can be enforced. Follow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

BBCNews_29,"Healthcare workers are being told not to report women to the police if they believe their patients may have illegally ended their own pregnancy. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) says ""deeply traumatised"" women are being prosecuted following abortions. By law, patients' data must not be disclosed without their consent. The new guidance follows a recent rise in police investigations into abortions. The RCOG says these cases are rare, however, and it is encouraging women to seek medical help if needed. NHS staff are allowed to breach confidentiality rules to give information to the police about possible crimes, but only if it is in the ""public interest"". The RCOG says it is ""never"" in the public interest to report women who have abortions, and that they must be safeguarded. In the first official guidance issued of its kind, a healthcare worker must ""justify"" any disclosure of patient data or ""face potential fitness to practice proceedings"". The organisation says it is ""concerned"" by the rising number of police investigations following abortions and pregnancy loss, and the effect this might have on ""especially vulnerable"" patients. Dr Jonathan Lord, who co-chairs the RCOG abortion taskforce and the British Society of Abortion Care Providers told BBC News: ""A law that was originally designed to protect a woman is now being used against her. ""We have witnessed life-changing harm to women and their wider families as a direct result of NHS staff reporting women suspected of crimes, and we just don't think that would happen in other areas of healthcare. ""We deal with the most vulnerable groups who may be concerned about turning to regulated healthcare at all, and we need them to trust us"". Dr Lord said he believed some NHS staff had shared information with police because they were ""ignorant"" about confidentiality regulations. In 2022, the number of suspected illegal abortions logged with police forces in England and Wales rose to 29, from 16 in 2018. Abortions are legal in England if they are performed by a registered medical practitioner and take place within the first 24 weeks of pregnancy. Otherwise, it is illegal to deliberately end a pregnancy and, under the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act, it carries a maximum punishment of life imprisonment. Last year, six women were prosecuted in England on suspicion of breaking abortion law, according to the RCOG, compared with just three in the previous 20 years. It is believed their information may have been handed to police by medical staff. Dr Lord said many women who had been investigated had in fact had late miscarriages, or had been later in their pregnancy than they had realised when they had had terminations. Recent prosecutions include that of Carla Foster, who was jailed for procuring her own abortion in 2020, and Bethany Cox from Teesside, who was cleared of the same charge earlier this month. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said cases such as these were very rare: ""We carefully consider the personal circumstances of those who end their pregnancy outside the legal parameters and address these as sensitively as possible. ""Our prosecutors have a duty to ensure that laws set by Parliament are properly considered and applied when making difficult charging decisions."" The RCOG says it supports an amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill, which would have the effect of protecting women from prosecution for having abortions. A government spokesperson told the BBC: ""It is important that all women have access to safe and legal abortions on the NHS... ""We understand this is an extremely sensitive issue and we recognise the strongly held views on all sides of the discussion.  ""That is why, by longstanding convention, any change to the law in this area would be a matter of conscience for individual MPs rather than the government."" The Society for the Protection of Unborn Children said that by advising against reporting to the police, the RCOG risks undermining the public's trust in the medical profession and the legal system itself.  Spokesperson for Right To Life UK, Catherine Robinson, raised concerns about illegal abortions occurring as a result of abuse, coercion or sex trafficking. ""This new guidance appears to create a presumption against disclosing information about illegal abortions to the police, and this could leave vulnerable women in these situations being denied the protection of the law,"" she said.  The victims were killed in separate, unrelated incidents in the Austrian capital on Friday. Women take part despite some in the community suggesting it should remain a men-only event. Parents in England wanting 15 hours free childcare for two-year-olds face an important deadline. Democrats have already seized on the issue, which could complicate Republican plans to win back suburban women.

BBCNews_30,"Japan has begun trial sales of morning-after pills without a prescription. Under the pilot, the pill is set to be available at 145 pharmacies. Until now these had only been available at a clinic or pharmacy with a doctor's prescription. A public consultation by Japan's health ministry found overwhelming support to make it available over the counter. Rights groups have criticised the scheme, saying it is too small, and called for restrictions to be lifted.  Under existing rules, women, including victims of sexual assault, have to go to a clinic or hospital for a prescription to obtain emergency contraception The pills - NorLevo and the generic version levonorgestrel - work best within 72 hours after unprotected sex and have an efficacy rate of 80%. Selling the drug without a prescription was first discussed by a health ministry panel back in 2017, but officials stopped short of giving it the green light, saying that making the morning-after pill more easily available would encourage irresponsible use of the drug. The health ministry has now found overwhelming support after a public consultation - 97% in favour - to allow the sale on a trial basis. Globally, emergency contraceptives are available without a prescription at pharmacies in about 90 countries. The initial phase of the over-the-counter sale in Japan will cover only 0.2% of the 60,000 pharmacies in the country, which rights groups say is insufficient.  The campaign group Emergency Contraceptives at Pharmacies Project has urged the health ministry to make the pill available fully and rapidly in all drugstores without restrictions. The organisation's co-chair, Asuka Someya, said: ""There are many who say they cannot talk to their parents about possible pregnancy. It's going to be difficult if they have to talk about their sexual experiences and concern about pregnancy.""  The World Health Organization has called for emergency contraception pills - commonly known as morning-after pills - to be routinely included within all national family planning programmes.  Dependent on the outcome of the trial, Japan may approve a full-scale rollout.  The victims were killed in separate, unrelated incidents in the Austrian capital on Friday. Women take part despite some in the community suggesting it should remain a men-only event. Parents in England wanting 15 hours free childcare for two-year-olds face an important deadline.

BBCNews_31,"Four women living with HIV in Kenya have each been awarded $20,000 (£16,000) in damages for being sterilised without their informed consent. They have spoken to the BBC about their experiences. The women fought a nine-year legal battle - and their names have been changed to protect their identities, which were not revealed during the case at the High Court. ""It has ruined my life,"" Penda told the BBC about the surgery she underwent shortly after having twins at the state-owned Pumwani Maternity Hospital in the capital, Nairobi. The procedure is called a bilateral tubal ligation (BTL) - when a woman's fallopian tubes are cut, tied, burned, clipped or partly removed, closing them and preventing future pregnancies. The father of her twins left before they were born. Her husband had died a few years earlier of HIV-related complications. She is distressed that she will never find another partner: ""Who will marry me if they know I can't give birth?"" Penda knew she was HIV-positive when she became pregnant so had sought medical advice. At the time, pregnant women with HIV were encouraged to give birth by caesarean section and to not breastfeed their babies to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the virus.  These are expensive routes to go down for many from poorer backgrounds. Nowadays most maternity care in Kenya is free. But it has not always been the case.  After giving birth, Penda says she was told to exclusively use formula milk. She says she was assured she was entitled to get free food for herself and the babies, but only if she showed proof that she was using family planning. ""As a single mother, that shocked me. I was already struggling with stigma. I didn't know what else to do,"" she says. To help Penda obtain this proof, the hospital nutritionist referred her to a community health worker who told her to report to a clinic where personnel from Marie Stopes, Kenya's largest and most-specialised sexual reproductive health organisation, ran a family planning programme. Here Penda was given a form, which she signed, to have a BTL. As she cannot read, she says she did not know she had given her consent to be sterilised. Neema related a similar experience at the Pumwani, which is Kenya's largest public maternity hospital. She already knew her positive HIV status by the time she was expecting her fourth child. She was worried about infecting her unborn baby. She says she was told by a nutritionist there that if she did not agree to undergo a BTL after giving birth, she would not qualify to receive portions of cooking oil porridge and maize-meal flour, and that her maternity health bill would not be paid. On the day of her delivery, before being taken to theatre, Neema said the nurse on duty advised her of the need to plan her family since she already had three children.  The nurse told her to undergo a BTL and she was given a piece of paper to sign agreeing to both a caesarean and the tubal ligation. ""I didn't know what it meant. I thought it was ordinary family planning,"" Neema told the BBC. ""If they had explained the procedure properly to me, I wouldn't have signed that paper."" In Furaha's case she remembers no discussion about family planning before she had her third child at the Pumwani Maternity Hospital. She only recalls consenting to a caesarean section to prevent her from infecting her newborn with HIV - and then waking up in unbearable pain. A nurse explained that she had also undergone the sterilisation procedure. ""I was too afraid to tell my husband what happened. I kept it to myself,"" she told the BBC. ""When he found out, he became a total drunkard. He died after he was hit by a moving vehicle. These organisations destroyed my home."" A fourth woman, Faraja, told the BBC she caved into pressure to undergo the BTL two months after delivering her third child. As she was HIV-positive, she had been cautioned against breastfeeding her newborn. But without proof that she was using family planning - in particular a BTL - she was not able to receive free baby formula milk. ""I was desperate. My husband had left. My rent was due. What could I have done?"" she asks. Faraja told the Kenyan High Court that she attended a clinic where she underwent the procedure.  She was given a form to sign, but says that because she cannot read, she did not understand what she was signing. No-one explained to her that she had agreed to be sterilised, and she says she was not offered alternative family planning. It is because health professionals did not explicitly explain what these women had agreed to that they won their case. The High Court of Kenya ruled in September that this use of BTL without informed consent was a violation of the women's fundamental rights, including the right to establish a family.  The damages they are to receive will be paid jointly by Marie Stopes International and the Pumwani Maternity Hospital as well as the medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), which gave family planning advice. Allan Maleche, executive director of Kelin Kenya, an HIV-rights group that represented them, says the judgement is very significant for HIV-positive women in Africa who have experienced pressure to undergo sterilisation. ""For a very long time, cases that were filed in South Africa, in Namibia, had the difficulty making the link between the tubal ligation and the HIV status. The significance of this case is that it reaffirmed the fact that it is wrong,"" he told the BBC. A Marie Stopes spokesperson in Kenya told the BBC by email that the case had been a long and difficult ordeal for all those involved. ""We welcome a resolution after nearly a decade. Informed consent has always been integral to everything we do. ""As a member of the global reproductive rights community, we understand the stigma that people living with HIV continue to face. We will continue to undertake rigorous training and monitoring to ensure that the highest standards are adhered to, and we will never be complacent about the care we deliver."" MSF France maintains that it never performed, nor is it currently performing, medical sterilisations in Kenya. It says if the patient opts to undergo a BTL, its role is to counsel, to inform and refer them to selected facilities.  ""We acknowledge the part of the responsibility for what happened to the women and restate as a medical organisation, our commitment to the patient informed consent process,"" Dr Hajir Elyas, MSF's country director in Kenya, told the BBC. The Pumwani Maternity Hospital did not respond to the BBC's invitation to comment. There is no accurate data about how many women living with HIV in Kenya have been sterilised without their informed consent.  However, a 2012 study carried out by the African Gender and Media Initiative - Robbed of Choice - documented the experiences of 40 women who had been coerced into sterilisation. Of these, only five successfully filed a constitutional petition. Mr Maleche says the women chose to file constitutional petitions, rather than criminal cases, because this type of litigation has a bigger impact. ""A criminal case would only either lead to imprisonment, a payment of fines. There would be no benefits that would go to the women in terms of monetary compensation,"" he says. But the women say their case was not just about compensation. They say the High Court judgment has validated their demand for justice. Their lawyer, Nyokabi Njogu, agrees: ""How do you compensate for a compounding violation? ""They just wanted an acknowledgement that this happened. They don't want women who have suffered like them to continue in that suffering.""  People pay their respects at the funeral of world record holder Kelvin Kiptum who died at 24. South Africans and Ethiopians are among those who will no longer have to pay a $30 fee to enter. Kelvin Kiptum is to be buried in his village in Kenya where his family remember what made him special. The Kenyan and Nigerian presidents face domestic criticism for their frequent trips abroad. Kelvin Kiptum had planned to build a home for his family before he was killed in a road accident.

BBCNews_32,"Nancy Pontius is ready to share an unpopular view: she doesn't think inflation is a major issue, and says concerns about the economy won't influence her vote in November's election. But that's not because the 36-year-old Democrat hasn't felt the same financial strain as tens of millions of Americans over the past couple of years. ""I definitely felt the gas price increase,"" the mum-of-two from Pennsylvania says, ""but I also recognised that it was likely to be temporary"". Ms Pontius voted for Joe Biden four years ago and plans to do so again, motivated by issues like abortion. ""I'm not worried about the big picture economy,"" she says. Such confidence is welcome news for Mr Biden, whose first term has been troubled by a once-in-a-generation 18% leap in prices, which propelled economic dissatisfaction and eroded political support. Even as the American economy's booming emergence from the pandemic drew envy abroad, opinions at home remained starkly negative.  Now there are signs that may be changing, as petrol prices fall back towards $3 a gallon nationally and wages get closer to catching up with price rises. Economic sentiment - what some pollsters describe as the ""vibe"" that people feel around the economy - has improved in business surveys in recent months.  Democrats like Nancy are now as positive about the economy as they were in 2021, when prices had just started their climb - and more positive than at any point during the Trump presidency, according to the University of Michigan, which has surveyed consumers for decades. Even the views of Republican voters have brightened a bit, their research indicates. The White House hopes the change in mood will last and shore up support for the president as the election approaches in November - especially in crucial swing states like Pennsylvania. But that's far from guaranteed.  The president's approval ratings are hovering around the lowest levels of his term, hit by concerns over immigration, his age and the war in Gaza. And despite the positive signs, overall economic sentiment has yet to recover from the beating it took during the pandemic, despite solid growth and a historic streak of unemployment below 4%.  Among Democrats, the issue is particularly hurting Mr Biden with those under the age of 30, just a quarter of whom rated the economy as excellent or good in a recent Pew survey, compared to 70% over the age of 65. Kim Schwartz, a 28-year-old health technician from Pennsylvania, voted for Mr Biden in 2020 but has been disappointed by his economic policies. ""I don't see any progress in getting more money into the hands of middle class and working class Americans to keep up with [inflation],"" she says.""I am going to vote, but whether it will be a write-in or third party or Biden, I don't know.""  Though her financial position has improved since 2020, when she was struggling to cover her expenses while studying and working part-time, she still scouts multiple grocery stores each week in search of the lowest prices.  She has deferred work on her car due to cost concerns; and big financial and life goals, like buying a house, still feel achingly out of reach. ""I am surviving,"" she says. ""It's enough to maintain but it's not enough to improve or progress."" It's a truism of American politics that the state of the economy decides elections. On that basis, Mr Biden should be in safe territory, with growth of 2.5% last year and inflation down sharply from its 2022 high, at 3.1% last month. But the typical weekly wage in the US, adjusted for inflation, at the end of last year remained lower than it was when Mr Biden took office.  Frustrations like Kim's turn up repeatedly in political polling, where majorities express serious concern with the price of food, consumer goods and housing and describe the state of the economy as ""poor"" or ""fair"".  ""It's like a race and you're trying to keep up with it,"" says John Cooke, a 34-year-old restaurant manager in Pennsylvania. Though business at the eateries where he works has been good, he says inflation has cut into profits and he has not had a pay raise.   ""Car insurance has gone up, health insurance has gone up, my rent has gone up. They are saying the economy is doing great. That's great to show me all these numbers but how is that helping me?""  Republicans, who have an historic advantage among voters on economic issues, have made the economy one of their key lines of attack, hammering Mr Biden on inflation and blaming his ""tax-and-spend"" agenda for driving up prices.  Economists say generous government financial support for households during the pandemic did help to fuel inflation by lifting consumer demand and cushioning household budgets, allowing firms to put up prices without major blowback. But the shock to oil prices from the war in Ukraine and supply shortages tied to the pandemic also played important roles. Democrats have held their own in elections since 2020 - including the 2022 midterms - by blaming wider forces for inflation and focusing on non-economic issues that motivate the base. But independent and infrequent voters, for whom the economy ranks highly, are more likely to vote in presidential contests.  ""The core issues the Biden coalition cares about are still issues like abortion, like gun safety, like voting rights, like climate change,"" says Danielle Deiseroth, executive director at the progressive pollster Data for Progress. ""But in an election that's going to come down to a couple thousand votes in a couple of states, you can't leave any issue off the table for swing voters."" Strategists say Mr Biden for too long relied on the big national numbers to defend his record - a response that felt emotionally out of touch.  ""When you just say the economy is great; GDP is great - nobody ever bought a dozen eggs with GDP. Nobody cares,"" says pollster Celinda Lake, who worked on Mr Biden's 2020 campaign.   That criticism appears to have landed. In recent weeks, Mr Biden has adopted a markedly more populist tone, attacking companies for price gouging and ""shrinkflation"" - charging more for less - and sharpening his criticism of ""extreme MAGA Republican"" economic policies. Don Cunningham, a long-time Democratic politician in Pennsylvania, says he expects the disconnect between economic sentiment and reality to heal in the months ahead. Mr Cunningham leads the Lehigh Valley Economic Development Corporation - drumming up investment in a former steel-making region that was hit hard in the 1980s as the industry hollowed out, but is enjoying a revival today.  ""I see challenges [for Biden] there but they are not related to economic issues,"" he says. ""How people are feeling personally, how candidates make them feel, if there's an age gap, if younger folks are frustrated because there's not someone from their generation... those are all real issues that go into how people vote and why people vote."" There are signs a significant number of Americans are dismayed by the likely choice they face in November - with Mr Biden and Mr Trump looking set for a 2020 rematch. Even Nancy's urgency has cooled. Four years ago, she proudly planted a Biden sign on her lawn, but going into the 2024 race she's planning to take a lower profile, leery of alienating her neighbours. ""We might still put the Biden-Harris sign out,"" she says. ""But I was willing to be a little louder in 2020... than I am now."" If you're in the UK, sign up here. And if you're anywhere else, sign up here. The former president moves closer to the Republican nomination with a huge win in his rival's home state.

BBCNews_33,"Democrats are celebrating their victory in a special election for a seat left vacant when Republican George Santos was expelled from Congress.  Tom Suozzi's win on Tuesday night over Mazi Pilip shaves the Republican party's already razor-thin majority in the House of Representatives. Democrats said the result shows they can take the fight to Republicans on the hot-button issue of immigration. Mr Santos was ousted last December over allegations of fraud and corruption. With most ballots tallied, Mr Suozzi had 54% of the vote, while Ms Pilip had 46%, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner.  Registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans in the third congressional district, which extends from the New York City borough of Queens into the western suburbs of Long Island. Mr Suozzi, who ran as a moderate, will finish Mr Santos's term before running again this November.  In a victory speech briefly interrupted by protesters calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, Mr Suozzi spoke of healing political differences. He also took a swipe at Republicans who control the House, saying: ""Let's send a message to our friends running the Congress these days: stop running around for Trump, and start running the country."" Ms Pilip distanced herself from Mr Trump for much of the campaign, and the former president said in a post on Truth Social on Tuesday night that she was a ""very foolish woman"" because she did not endorse him. The election marks a return to Congress for the Democrat, who previously served three terms in the US House but opted in 2022 to run for governor in New York instead.  That bid was unsuccessful, and voters replaced him in Congress with Mr Santos. Ms Pilip, a state legislator who did not have as much name recognition as her rival, made immigration central to her campaign. She blamed Mr Suozzi and his fellow Democrats for New York City's wave of migrant arrivals and the crisis unfolding at the southern border.  But Mr Suozzi emphasised the need to strengthen border policy, saying that he had at times defied his own party on the issue while in Congress.  Democrats said the race could hold a roadmap to the US general election in November. Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut posted on X: ""Like Suozzi, Democrats can and should go on the offense on the border. Everywhere."" It follows the collapse of a bipartisan Senate border security bill after Mr Trump and his allies condemned it as inadequate. Ms Pilip, an Ethiopian-Israeli immigrant and observant Jew, had pitched her unwavering support of Israel in a district with a large share of Jewish voters. But Mr Suozzi declared himself a staunch ally of Israel, too, arguing that he would counterbalance left-wing Democrats who want to slash US aid to Israel. Mr Suozzi seized on the issue of abortion to counter-attack Ms Pilip, a mother-of-seven who said she was personally against terminating pregnancies, but would not force her beliefs others. This result reduces the Republican House majority to 219-213. Three seats - one of which was held by ex-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy until his resignation in December - remain vacant.  By a margin of just one vote on Tuesday evening, House Republicans impeached Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas over the border crisis. Copyright 2024 BBC.

BBCNews_34,"North Korea has ripped up a five-year-old deal with Seoul aimed at lowering military tensions, in the latest escalation of a row between the two. It all started when Pyongyang claimed to have successfully launched a spy satellite into space on Tuesday. This led to South Korea part suspending the agreement, saying it would resume surveillance flights along the border. Pyongyang is now vowing to fully suspend the pact and send stronger forces and equipment to the border. ""From now on, our army will never be bound by the September 19 North-South Military Agreement,"" it said in a statement. It promised to withdraw all measures ""taken to prevent military conflict in all spheres including ground, sea and air"", and deploy ""more powerful armed forces and new-type military hardware"" in the border region. Pyongyang fired a rocket believed to contain its Malligyong-1 spy satellite late on Tuesday and hailed the launch as a ""success"".  South Korea's military later confirmed that the satellite had entered orbit but said it was too soon to tell if it was actually functioning. Seoul strongly condemned the launch - and on Wednesday morning top officials agreed to immediately restart surveillance operations along the border, which would allow the South to monitor North Korean outposts and long-range artillery. That is a breach of a no-fly zone established under the Comprehensive Military Agreement in 2018 - signed by both nations' leaders in an attempt to de-escalate tensions between their two countries and prevent a conflict erupting. But North Korea has violated the pact multiple times over the past two years, by launching missiles and firing artillery rounds into the sea in the South's direction. Last December, it sent drones across the border into South Korea, with one flying as far as the capital Seoul. This was part of Seoul's justification to scrap parts of the agreement - that the North was already not abiding by it. Some analysts therefore argue that Pyongyang officially withdrawing from the deal might not make much of a difference. ""Because North Korea was not adhering to the agreement in the first place, the possibility of limited collision has always been there"", said Jo Bee Yun of the Korea Institute for Defence Analysis. Though both sides are blaming each other for escalating tensions and threatening to retaliate, Jo Bee Yun called this a ""political tit-for-tat"" that would not necessarily result in a ""physical military collision"". The outcome will likely depend on what action the North now takes. Chun In-bum, a retired South Korean Army lieutenant general, said the North would want to ""make life as difficult for the South as the South makes it for them"". He predicted that they will start by displaying artillery along the border, and by flying more drones, possibly into South Korean territory. South Korea's defence minister Shin Won-sik warned earlier that if the North used the suspension as an excuse to carry out provocations, Seoul would ""immediately and firmly punish it to the end."" He said he would be monitoring the North's behaviour and discussing what counter measures to take with President Yoon Suk-yeol, when he returns from his trip to the UK. Pyongyang insists the launch of the spy satellite is part of its ""right to self-defence"" - but it has been strongly condemned by South Korea, the US and Japan. Developing a functioning spy satellite is a major part of North Korea's five-year military plan, set out by its leader Kim Jong Un in January 2021. The technology could in theory enable Pyongyang to monitor the movement of US and South Korean troops and weapons on the Korean Peninsula, allowing it to spot incoming threats. It would also allow the North to plot its nuclear attacks with more precision. North Korean state media has claimed the country's leader Kim Jong Un is already reviewing images of US military bases in Guam sent by the new satellite. The BBC has not verified this.  South Korea captain Son Heung-min asks fans to forgive Lee Kang-in after his team-mate apologises for his involvement in an altercation between the pair at the Asian Cup.

BBCNews_35,"A new pro-life society at the University of Manchester has caused controversy with more than 15,000 people signing a petition calling for it to be dissolved. The student-organised petition criticised the university's decision to allow the society to be formed, claiming it added to an ""already prevalent stigma"" surrounding abortion. The students' union said it could not block a society forming because of their beliefs. The Manchester Pro-Life society said it existed to ""promote the wellbeing, and dignity of every human life, from conception"". It claimed it was ""not an anti-abortion society but a pro-life society"". The society was officially affiliated by Manchester Students' Union on 11 January before an Instagram post announced the committee on 9 February. Its committee consists of its president, George Vincent, a history of art student, and its treasurer, medical student Jacob Karinatan. A third student was also on the committee but had since removed their name from the society's Instagram post. The petition calling for the society's dissolution claims its existence ""adds to an already prevalent stigma surrounding abortion"", believing women at the University of Manchester ""should not have to face additional pressure or judgement on such personal matters"". It said: ""The student union should be a place that supports all students' rights and wellbeing rather than endorsing societies that aim to abolish these rights."" On its webpage, the pro-life society said it aimed ""to create a pro-life culture on campus and support the dignity of every human life from conception"" and encourages students to join to ""help promote life"".  In a statement to the BBC, a spokesperson for the society said: ""We exist to encourage students to think critically about the way we define and value human life. ""While we oppose abortion, we are also concerned with other threats to life including assisted suicide, the death penalty, deaths occurring through poverty and poor living standards, structural issues in critical infrastructure such as the NHS, and climate change."" The Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Act 2023, which comes into full effect on 1st August, legislates on a university's duties when it comes to freedom of speech. It states students' union's have a duty to ""promote the importance of"" freedom of speech and academic expression. The legislation stipulates that students' union's ""must take the steps that are reasonably practicable""  to secure compliance with the code of practice set out on the act. In a statement issued on their website, the University of Manchester Students' Union executive officers said: ""We believe that fostering a culture of proactive involvement enables students to voice their opinions, challenge perspectives, and contribute to a diverse and inclusive campus environment.   ""As a students’ union, operating as a charity, we must also ensure equitable access to resources, participation in activities, and the formation of groups for all members, irrespective of their lawful views.  ""As a result, diverse societies and students with conflicting perspectives coexist on campus. ""From a legal standpoint, it’s not possible to stop a society from affiliating for their legal views that are contrary to the views of other students.  ""That means, despite concerns over student safety, the students’ union can’t block a society from forming because of their beliefs.""

BBCNews_36,"Home Secretary James Cleverly has said he is committed to ensuring women feel safe accessing an abortion, after the government was accused of watering down plans to prevent protests near clinics.  A law to introduce buffer zones in England and Wales was passed last May. But under draft Home Office guidance, activities including ""silent prayer"" would still be allowed.  Campaigners are worried this will mean women are still at risk of being harassed outside clinics.  Earlier this week, Labour MP Rupa Huq and Conservative Sir Bernard Jenkin wrote to Mr Cleverly calling for an ""urgent review"" of the draft guidance, which was published by the Home Office before Christmas and first reported by the i newspaper.  In a response, seen by the BBC, Mr Cleverly said the guidance was drafted before he was made home secretary in November.  He said he approved the launching of a public consultation ""within days of coming into office"" to make sure ""there was no further delay to the process"".  ""It is clearly unacceptable for anyone to be harassed or distressed simply for exercising their legal right to access abortion services,"" he wrote. ""I am committed to ensuring that women in England and Wales feel safe and protected whilst exercising their legal right to access abortion services."" He agreed to meet the MPs to discuss their concerns, adding: ""All views will be carefully considered ahead of publishing the final version of the guidance."" The consultation on the guidance closes on Monday, with the government previously saying it wanted the measures to be implemented from the spring.  In their letter, Ms Huq and Sir Bernard said they were concerned the draft guidance appeared to contradict what MPs voted for last year.  Under section 9 of the Public Order Act, harassing, obstructing or causing distress to anyone attending an abortion clinic, within a 150 metre ""safe access zone"", was made a criminal offence carrying an unlimited fine. Influencing someone's decision to access an abortion within the area is also an offence under the act.  The measures had cross-party support, although they were opposed by some senior politicians including Minister for Women and Equalities Kemi Badenoch and Mr Cleverly's predecessor as Home Secretary, Suella Braverman. The law does not include any exemptions for silent prayer, with MPs previously voting against a move to specifically exclude this from the scope of the legislation.  However, the draft guidance says silent prayer ""should not, on its own, be considered to be an offence under any circumstances"". It also states: ""The government would expect 'influence' to require more than mere mention of abortion or the provision of information. As such, informing, discussing or offering help does not necessarily amount to 'influence'."" Ms Huq and Sir Bernard wrote: ""The framing of the guidance seems to us to very clearly discount the experiences and reports of women accessing abortion care, and instruct them that they should not feel harassed, alarmed, distressed, or influenced by behaviour which… is having precisely that impact."" The MPs added that they had been told by councils, police and abortion care providers that the draft guidance ""would do nothing to address the ongoing issue of anti-abortion harassment outside clinics"".  The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), which is the leading provider of abortion advice and treatment in the UK, has said it is ""shocked"" by the government's attempt to ""gut a law which a majority of MPs voted for"".  The anti-abortion group Christian Concern has previously commented on the government's draft guidance, saying it ""acknowledges that buffer zones must be interpreted in line with human rights, including the right to manifest religious beliefs, the right to freedom of expression and the right to freedom of assembly and association"". The victims were killed in separate, unrelated incidents in the Austrian capital on Friday. Women take part despite some in the community suggesting it should remain a men-only event. Parents in England wanting 15 hours free childcare for two-year-olds face an important deadline.

BBCNews_37,"The US Supreme Court will decide whether to restrict access to a commonly used abortion pill. It will be the most significant US reproductive rights case after the court overturned Roe v Wade, ending a nationwide right to abortion.  The Biden administration had asked the court to overturn a decision to limit access to the drug mifepristone over anti-abortion groups' safety concerns. The pill has been legal in the US since 2000 and research has shown it is safe. The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, will hear arguments early next year. A ruling is expected next summer, months before the next presidential election.  This current clash over access began in November 2022, when an umbrella group of anti-abortion doctors and activists known as the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine sued in Texas. They claimed the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had unlawfully approved the drug and alleged the pill was unsafe.  The case puts the court back in the position to decide American reproductive rights, less than two years after overturning Roe v Wade - a landmark 1973 ruling that guaranteed abortion access in the US. Since the court nixed the decades-old decision, nearly two dozen states have moved to ban or restrict abortion procedures. Other states have moved to expand access by adding legal safeguards.  More recently, that battle over abortion has centred on medication abortions, now the most common method of ending pregnancies in the US, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-abortion research group.  The two drug-regimen was approved for use up to 10 weeks of pregnancy by the FDA in 2000. When used, a patient is first given mifepristone to induce an abortion and then misoprostol to empty the uterus. Since 2016, the FDA has further eased access to the drug. The agency has allowed doctors to meet patients via telemedicine and prescriptions to be sent by mail. Over its two decades of use, the FDA, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynaecologists (ACOG) and other mainstream medical organisations have maintained that both drugs are safe.  Abortion advocates have long championed medication abortion as a less expensive and less invasive method of ending pregnancy. Anti-abortion groups have countered with claims that abortion pills - cast as ""chemical abortion"" - are ineffective and dangerous.  In April, Texas Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, who has shared anti-abortion views publicly, sided with those suing and imposed a nationwide ban on mifepristone. He argued the FDA had erred in its scientific assessment of the drug and violated federal rules that allow some drugs to be approved more quickly. An appeals court later allowed the drug to remain on the market with some restrictions. The Supreme Court then paused the rulings while the case played out.  The justices said on Wednesday they would decide whether to keep recent restrictions implemented by the lower courts. The Supreme Court's ruling could bring back earlier rules, requiring patients to visit a doctor's office for a prescription and to pick up the drug in person. The Supreme Court declined to reconsider mifepristone's FDA approval, however, suggesting the justices are unlikely to completely pull the pill from the market.   The decision could affect abortion access for millions of women, particularly in states where abortion access is severely restricted. Nancy Northup, the president of pro-choice group Center for Reproductive Rights applauded the court's review of the ""erroneous"" restrictions on mifepristone.  ""Abortion pills have been used safely in the US for more than 20 years, and they are more important than ever in this post-Roe landscape. That is precisely why the anti-abortion movement is attacking them,""  she said in a statement.  Some anti-abortion groups also welcomed the court's decision, alleging the case would illuminate the dangers of abortion pills. In a statement, policy director of anti-abortion group Susan B Anthony Pro-Life America Katie Daniel told the BBC that the FDA ""has misled the American people with its repeated claims that the abortion pill regimen is 'safe and effective'"". She blasted the agency for allowing telemedicine and mailed prescriptions.  US studies say medication abortion is effective at ending pregnancy about 95% of the time and there is less than 1% chance of further medical follow-up.  Deaths associated with mifepristone since its approval are fewer than those linked to common antibiotics used to treat bronchitis, sore throats, and other bacterial infections.  The court's decision could have major implications for other FDA-approved drugs as well, Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said. ""The plaintiffs' efforts potentially implicate the entire FDA new drug application process, which could undermine research and development of new drugs that save lives and reduce pain,"" he said. The private meeting came as the US prepared to announced a new raft of sanctions against Russia. Moscow responds to Joe Biden's sweary remarks about the Russian president at a California fundraiser. The German Shepherd's attacks caused the Secret Service to change tactics for safety, documents show. An agent tasked with protecting Naomi Biden fired his weapon during the incident in Washington DC. Alexander Smirnov is charged with making false statements about President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Copyright 2024 BBC.

BBCNews_38,"A victim of a Rochdale grooming gang has said she was raped more than 100 times from the age of 12 and felt ""let down"" by police. Ruby also told BBC Newsnight police took her aborted foetus away for DNA testing without telling her. Former detective Maggie Oliver said that years after Ruby's abuse, child sexual exploitation was still happening across the country. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said it was ""deeply sorry"" for failing victims. ""Poor service"" in Rochdale in the early 2000s was a ""profound regret"", the force said, adding that while child sexual exploitation had ""not been eradicated"" officers would ""continue to police without fear or favour"". Ruby said she wanted to help other abused children who need to ""feel listened to and heard"" when they report the crime to police. She has called for counselling to be offered after police interviews. In January, a review revealed girls in Rochdale were ""left at the mercy"" of paedophile grooming gangs for years because of failings by senior police and council bosses. It focused on 111 cases in the town from 2004 to 2013 and set out a series of failed investigations by GMP, identifying 96 men still deemed a potential risk to children. Rochdale Council said it was ""determined to ensure these terrible failures do not happen again"". Warning: Some readers might find the following report distressing Ruby, whose real name cannot be revealed for legal reasons, said the abuse started after some older men invited her and her friends to a takeaway and a flat for food and drinks. For a few weeks that was all that happened.    But one day at the flat ""they wouldn't let us in the room"" because other people were in there, she said.  ""They gave us a litre of vodka with no mixer and 10 fags. So by the time we went in the other room, we were all really drunk."" Ruby said there were about ""30 to 40 men waiting for us"" and then ""they raped me... continuously"". ""One would finish [raping me] and then the other one would come in and it was just like that all night."" She said the abuse continued because the gang threatened her and she felt ""there was no way out"".  ""They'd get our numbers, they'd come to the schools, they'd come near my house, they'd come everywhere and they'd look for us and find us."" She said she was raped ""possibly over a hundred [times]"" by men ""from all over the country"" for four years. ""There was men from Bradford and Nelson and Birmingham, Blackpool… [the gang] took us everywhere,"" she said.  ""I feel like I just became numb to it."" In 2008, Ruby went to a sexual health clinic, which she said was a ""cry for help because there was nobody else to help us"". ""We told schools, and social services knew what was happening. Again, nothing happened, so we went there, but we were given flavoured condoms and sent away."" The review confirmed that Ruby had previously disclosed to the Crisis Intervention Team that she had older boyfriends giving her vodka and sexually abusing her. In that same year, she was placed on a child protection plan, and the police were aware of her situation by the start of 2009. Ruby had an abortion when she was 13 and GMP took possession of the foetus to forensically examine it for potential DNA matches with suspects in an investigation. The review said it was ""highly unacceptable"" that Ruby was not told police had taken it. She said she was later approached by the force to ask if she wanted a funeral for the aborted foetus. In 2010, Ruby told a social worker about her ongoing abuse by six older Asian men, the review said. She also made disclosures to social services about the wide-scale abuse of children by up to 60 men. Two years later, one of the men who abused her was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment for trafficking for sexual exploitation.  But just four years on from that, Ruby saw him in a local shop. She said she had not been told about his release from jail.    ""At first I double looked because I didn't really believe what I'd seen. Then, when it hit me he's there, I ran,"" she said.  ""Then I just went home and I didn't leave the house for like three months after that."" Ruby said she phoned GMP and ""they did nothing"", adding: ""I was a mess."" The review, which examined GMP's investigations into child sexual exploitation over nine years, found the force had considered the crime a low-risk priority. Maggie Oliver resigned from GMP in 2012 over the poor handling of the abuse cases and established a foundation to support victims. She said child sexual exploitation was still happening in Rochdale and her foundation heard from victims ""throughout the country"". ""Victims today are telling me the same things that Ruby and those children told me 12 years ago,"" Ms Oliver said. ""I think the public knows what's going on, but I still think that the police and social services are pretending that lessons have been learned."" Ruby has called for more support for child victims of sexual abuse and said they should be offered psychological help after police interviews. ""I want every child who goes through the doors of the police station and reports sexual abuse to feel listened to and heard,"" she said. ""I feel that there's a lot of emotions going on. Instead of taking it home with them and just having to figure it out on [their] own [they should be] put in a room with a professional, so they can speak about the trauma."" A GMP representative said the force was ""deeply sorry for how it failed victims and survivors of child sexual exploitation"". GMP was now recognised as carrying out ""best practice with regards to how victims and survivors are believed and cared for"", they added. ""How we prevent and respond to CSE is vastly different  - particularly in how we work with partner agencies to identify and safeguard vulnerable young people, relentlessly pursue criminals, and care for victims."" A spokesperson from Rochdale Borough Council said: ""We are deeply sorry that the people who were at Rochdale Council during the period 2004 to 2013, like many other areas of the country, did not recognise or acknowledge what was happening and failed to take the necessary action to protect children from abuse.  ""Far more rigorous practices are in place today and we are determined to ensure these terrible failures do not happen again.""

BBCNews_39,"Every four years, Iowa is briefly catapulted to the centre of the political universe as it kicks off the election year race for the White House.  In a few hours, Republicans announce who they have chosen to represent the party against Democratic President Joe Biden in November's presidential election. US media has already called the race, projecting that ex-president Donald Trump has won the contest easily.  Voters in Iowa braved freezing conditions to cast their votes in a state which likes to do things a little differently from other places.  For a start, the vote is called a caucus. Most states run primary contests to nominate a presidential candidate but caucuses have a different, and more complicated, process.  Primaries are a kind of mini-election. Voters cast their ballots privately, either in person or by post, over the course of polling day.  Caucuses instead require party members to attend a location, in person, at a specific time. At schools, community centres and churches across the state, representatives for the candidates make speeches before those present cast their votes by writing down a name. Most states have moved away from caucuses in favour of primaries, but the Iowa Republican Party - along with those in Nevada, Idaho, Missouri, North Dakota, Hawaii, Wyoming and Kentucky - have all stuck to the system.  Voting started shortly after 19:00 local time (20:00 ET / 01:00 GMT) at about 1,700 precinct meetings across the state. Results will be submitted to the Iowa Republican Party and a winner is expected to be announced on Monday night in the hours after the vote. US media has projected Mr Trump as the winner based on entrance polls and their own data. You can follow the results as they come in, and all the reporting by BBC teams on the ground in Iowa, on our live page. A special election programme will be broadcast on the BBC News television channel from 19:00 ET (01:00 GMT). You can also listen to an Americast podcast from Iowa from about 22:00 ET (03:00 GMT). The Republican field has been whittled down to four main candidates: former president Donald Trump, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, former UN ambassador Nikki Haley and biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. Former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson is also running and former New Jersey governor Chris Christie dropped out a week ago. Ahead of the caucuses, Mr Trump dominated the field, and his campaign boasted they were aiming for a blowout victory in the caucuses.  His chief rivals in Iowa are Mr DeSantis - who has sought to tack to Mr Trump's right by fighting a campaign on culture war issues - and Ms Haley, who has fought a more moderate campaign on abortion and foreign policy issues.  Mr Trump has frequently repeated his false claims that he won the 2020 election and has energised supporters by accusing the Biden administration of mounting a political witch hunt against him.  The actual prize Republicans are fighting for in Iowa is minimal. Candidates will split a measly 40 delegates, a little more than 1% of the total number in play at the Republican National Convention in July.  But a win for any candidate in Iowa can help energise their campaign at a crucial early stage and potentially propel them to victory in the primaries.  It also marks the first time the country can see how a candidate fares in an actual election, and can generate significant attention in the media.  Former president Donald Trump has towered over the Republican field since he announced his candidacy in November 2022. His rivals have struggled to dent his support among the party's increasingly populist base.  Republican pollster Whit Ayers told the BBC that ""survival and momentum"" would be key for the anti-Trump candidates in the contest.  If Nikki Haley could beat [Ron] DeSantis for second place, that would give her a substantial boost, he observed.  ""Donors want to support a winner. If you can't get votes, you can't get money.""  Mr Trump, 77, has a commanding lead in the polls over his nearest rivals in Iowa.  The final poll of the Republican race there put him as the first choice of 48% of likely caucusgoers. Ms Haley was second, with 20%, while Mr DeSantis had slipped to third, at 16%.  Mr Ayers observed that voters can be split into three categories: People who will never vote for Mr Trump, staunch supporters of his agenda and a third category who are interested in alternatives.  ""About half of the party are 'maybe Trump' voters,"" he says. ""They are at least interested in who the alternatives are, they're maybe concerned about the amount of baggage he carries, his focus on the past, his concern with grievances as opposed to policies. So they are open to alternatives.""  Iowa has a pretty poor record of picking the eventual nominee - especially when it comes to choosing Republicans. Donald Trump is proof of that.  In 2016, he came second, languishing behind evangelical Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Neither of Mr Trump's two predecessors as Republican nominee won the state either.  In fact, George W Bush was the last non-incumbent Republican president to win both the state and the nomination in 2000.  Mr Ayers told the BBC that Iowa's problem picking candidates reflected how its population was ""completely different to much of the rest of the country"".  ""On the Republican side there are far more evangelicals than there are nationally. On the Democratic side there are almost no African-Americans in Iowa,"" he observed, noting that the group is a key pillar of the Democratic voting coalition.  This year the Democrats have chosen to prioritise states with a more racially diverse make-up than Iowa, which is overwhelmingly white.  Instead, the party's campaign will begin in South Carolina on 3 February and Nevada on 6 February.  Iowa voters will instead cast their ballots by mail, which will be counted on 5 March.

BBCNews_40,"Where do you get your news? Here's how to deepen your understanding of current affairs – according to research. Barely a month into 2024, it's difficult to know what shape the year will take. But one thing seems certain: politically, it's high-stakes. Elections will be held in the United States, Russia, Ukraine, Bangladesh, India, Taiwan, South Korea, and South Africa, for the European Parliament, and, many predict, in the UK too. That's not to mention the international conflicts in Israel-Gaza, Ukraine, and elsewhere, the climate crisis, explosion of AI, and economic challenges – among the other large-scale problems that require an informed and engaged public to help solve.  This means that it has, perhaps, never been more important to be a thoughtful, discerning citizen: no matter your country, you need a clear grasp of the world's issues – and of the policies put forward to solve them. People will never agree on the solutions, but surveys suggest most believe that a ""good member of society"" follows current affairs. Yet by some measures, people's grasp of contemporary issues is fading. In the US, for example, recent polls have found that a shrinking share of adults say they follow the news closely – from 51% in 2016 to 38% in 2022. Among younger people, aged 18 to 29, it's just 19%. It isn't just that citizens are tuning into traditional news media less. It's also that many are getting the news from elsewhere. Pew's polling has found, for example, that one in five US adults get their political news mainly from social media. And among those aged 18 to 29, it is nearly half. Facebook is the most common platform for news consumption in both the US and Europe, with one in three US adults getting news there regularly, compared to one in four on YouTube and one in six on Instagram and TikTok. To be clear, social media can have benefits: it can be a source of support and community, for example, and help disseminate useful information, like public health guidelines. But in terms of informing people, there is a downside. Many assume that social media has made their fellow citizens more informed about current events. But research generally has found the opposite: the more time someone spends on social media, the less they know about politics and current affairs.  You're reading this on the BBC, so you could be forgiven for thinking we are simply blowing our own trumpet as a mainstream news provider. But I promise, there is evidence backing up these statements. How Not To Be Manipulated In today's onslaught of overwhelming information (and misinformation), it can be difficult to know who to trust. In this column, Amanda Ruggeri explores smart, thoughtful ways to navigate the noise. Drawing on insights from psychology, social science and media literacy, it offers practical advice, new ideas and evidence-based solutions for how to be a wiser, more discerning critical thinker. The same 2020 Pew poll found that those US respondents who used social media the most, for example, were the least likely to correctly answer questions about topics in the news, like the Covid-19 pandemic and Donald Trump's impeachment. Only 17% of those who primarily got their news from social media had ""high political knowledge"", versus 45% who got their news from a news website or app. Not only were the social media users less likely to know what was going on in the world – but they were more likely to have heard false, or unproven, claims and conspiracy theories. And they expressed less concern about these claims than other cohorts. These findings have been backed up by other research. One study, for example, found that the more that participants used Facebook to consume and to share the news, the less political knowledge they had. Another found that every extra half hour of social media use reduced knowledge by about one correct answer out of an assessment of 16 questions. Of course, it could be a chicken-and-egg situation. Perhaps people who are less interested in politics may be more likely to be on TikTok than (say) reading the BBC News app. And people have long decried the political disaffection of youth. (In one 1938 article I came across, an ex-provost bewailed ""a flagging interest among young people in present-day politics"" – caused, he said, by the distractions of ""cinema"" and ""motor cars""). It's also important to remember that social media can offer numerous benefits when it comes to informing the public. For example, when major media outlets don't have the capacity, or access, to report what's happening on the ground, content shared by users who are there can fill huge gaps in knowledge. Take the Arab Spring: while the exact role of social media is still being debated, many academics agree that, particularly in countries where governments controlled media outlets, social media played a major role in sharing with the world what was happening. The same argument has been made about the Israel-Gaza war today. With international journalists' access into Gaza severely restricted, it is users on the ground (including Gazan journalists) who are sharing raw, unfiltered glimpses of life in the war zone through platforms like Instagram, TikTok and X (formerly Twitter). But social media has plenty of well-documented pitfalls, too. One is the potential tendency of social media platforms to create ""filter bubbles"": echo chambers helped along not only by like-minded communities of friends, but by ever-more-sophisticated algorithms that know your most intimately-held political opinions and push you similar content. Some research has found that this doesn't have as powerful as an effect as you might think – and even that social media users are exposed to a higher variety of media sources than traditional media users. But other experts disagree, and research has found that for highly divisive topics, in particular – like vaccines and abortion – users on platforms like Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) are more likely to see content that already aligns with their beliefs. Algorithms often seem to reward more extreme ideological positions, and those with more extreme positions are most active on these platforms. On X, for example, users with extreme positions tweet more than more moderate users, while the majority of tweets are shared by a minority of extreme users. Some of the social media firms have, under pressure, introduced labels or services that aim to stem misinformation. However, a lot of content is not vetted, fact-checked or verified, so these platforms have become common battlegrounds for forces of propaganda, disinformation and misinformation. Fake claims frequently go viral. Some even make their way into more mainstream media sources, like the recent false claim that a Palestinian baby killed by Israeli bombing was actually a doll, misinformation that was repeated (and later retracted) in a story by the Jerusalem Post. You may also like: So, if you're looking to be a smarter, better-informed citizen in 2024, should you avoid social media completely? Not necessarily. Like everything, it depends on how you use it. Given the research, I'd argue the best approach would be common-sense: limit your time on social media. Try to use it, primarily, for its original (if, today, somewhat archaic-seeming) purpose – keeping in touch with friends and forging new connections As far as information-gathering on social media goes, make sure you are following reputable news outlets and journalists. Exercise caution with accounts and posts pushed your way by the algorithm. And, when you come across a news claim, always verify it before engaging.  In coming instalments, I'll describe other expert tips on how best to verify information – and much more. This is the first in a column about how to navigate the information (and misinformation) of today's world, drawing on psychology, social science and other evidence-based research.

BBCNews_41,"Waiting times for Guernsey's Medical Specialist Group (MSG) remained below target last year. A report showed a rise in demand with thousands of more patients seen across the year compared to 2022. Two thirds of patients got an appointment inside of the target eight weeks, however, for 6% of patients it took more than six months to be seen. The areas with the longest waiting times were gastroenterology and orthopaedics. ""In the climate of ever-increasing demand, maintaining waiting lists at a stable level should arguably be viewed as a success story,"" said Dr Peter Rabey, medical director for Health and Social Care. The MSG is contracted by the States to provide secondary healthcare and the report looks at the Key Performance Indicator relating to the contract. It found inpatient admissions went up last year by 1,142 to 15,601 patients compared to 2022 and 20,998 new outpatient referrals, which was an increase of 1,128. Theatre activity also increased with an extra 319 patients, taking the total number of procedures to 4,640. Dr Rabey said they would continue to analyse performance and implement improvements collaboratively. He said: ""We cannot control demand for healthcare and there is no doubt that it will continue to increase as the population ages and more treatments become available.  ""We do not have infinite financial, staff, ward or theatre resources, but we have created additional capacity through our gastroenterology and orthopaedic waiting list initiatives, and this is helping to stem the tide."" Dr Steve Evans, MSG chair, said: ""We are very happy to be held accountable for how we work in partnership with the HSC to deliver high quality secondary healthcare to islanders. ""None of us want to see our patients waiting longer than they should and we are determined to continue to do all we can with HSC to reduce waiting times.""

BBCNews_42,"""You sweat profusely and you feel violently sick and you're crying out, the pain is so bad."" Gail Adams, 48, says delays in having a coil fitted left her in ""excruciating"" pain with endometriosis, and she was unable to work for three months.  Some patients in her area are waiting nine months for a coil - also used for contraception - to be fitted, compared to two weeks in most of the country. Cardiff and Vale health board said it has 900 people on its waiting list. A spokesperson said services were experiencing ""significant and sustained pressures nationally"", adding that ""colleagues are working tirelessly to see patients in a timely manner"". Hormonal intra uterine devices, also known as coils, can be used to help treat endometriosis, a painful condition thought to affect one in 10 women, where tissue similar to the womb lining grows in other places outside the uterus, sticking organs together. The hormonal coil, the copper coil and the implant are primarily used to prevent pregnancy and should be free and easy to access through NHS services. For Gail, a short appointment to fit one could have changed everything.  Instead the English teacher relied on hot water bottles and daily strong painkillers to cope with the constant ""dull ache"" of living with endometriosis.  Options included Gail's GP telling her about replacing her hormonal coil that would help treat the endometriosis and reduce her symptoms, but there was a four-month wait for this.  She described a flare-up as feeling like ""birthing pain"", and it dragged all down her legs, back, hips and stomach. The pain was so bad that she stopped working for almost three months and stopped socialising as she waited for her appointment. In the meantime, Cardiff and Vale health board's sexual health services put her on a seven-month waiting list. ""It's completely debilitating,"" she said. ""The only option is to double up on my painkillers and knock myself out."" An appointment to fit a coil takes about 30 minutes, with the actual fitting about five minutes. Cardiff Royal Infirmary currently has 900 people waiting for a coil or implant. Gail was recently offered a last-minute cancellation from her GP, and while she feels grateful, is concerned about others having to wait. She has now had the procedure, but remains off work. ""I still have the pain, but it's slowly getting better,"" she said ""There are so many women who are really fighting and advocating for themselves to get very simple procedures done for a very debilitating and life-changing illness."" Most of Wales' health boards reported waits of two weeks for a fitting after an initial contact, with the second longest wait being seven weeks in the Hywel Dda area of west Wales. However, within Cardiff and Vale, it was between five and six months. But some clinicians suggested to BBC Wales that some patients are waiting eight or nine months. A health board spokesperson encouraged patients to call its concerns team, adding: ""We are sorry to hear of this patient's experience and understand how difficult it is for patients who wait a long time for treatment."" There is ""not an equitable service for the women of Wales"" is how Dr Georgina Forbes described the situation. The Wales chairwoman of the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare said there was a real variety of waiting times across the country. She said that before Covid, meeting demand was difficult, but since the pandemic, coils and implants were ""put on the back burner"", leading to backlogs. Dr Forbes, who works for the Aneurin Bevan health board, also said drop-in clinics had closed while staff training and retention was an issue. ""In the meantime, you're still getting that same weight of referrals every week and the same number of women are ringing every week, it's really difficult to get that amount down,"" she said. Dr Forbes pointed out that it was not only fitting, but also removing coils that was an issue, potentially delaying women's ability to conceive. In its latest report, Public Health Wales recorded a 34% increase in the number getting abortions in the five years up to 2021. Dr Forbes said there was a partial link between abortion and contraception rates, adding: ""If we're diverting our workforce to abortion care, we're not solving some of the problem of the rising abortion rates."" Dr Forbes called for more ""impetus"" from the Welsh government, ""putting some pressure on trusts to provide the service within a timely manner"". The Welsh government said it was ""committed to ensuring access to a range of contraception options, provided safely and effectively by confident and competent fitters"". ""We expect all health boards to take positive action to improve the experiences and outcomes of women and address any inequalities,"" it added. ""NHS Wales is developing a comprehensive 10-year women's health plan.  ""This will act as the vehicle for transforming the care received by the women of Wales."" Farmers have been protesting after proposals which could have seen 10% of their land used for trees. The prime minister tells farmers ""we've got your back"" at the Welsh Conservative conference.

BBCNews_43,"Having been adopted as a baby, Steven Smith had always wanted to meet his birth mum.  He spent decades searching for her until a DNA test finally gave him the breakthrough he had been chasing.     But, after deciding to surprise her at her home, he was devastated to find her dead.  Now he is hoping to find his real dad to complete the remaining part of the puzzle. ""I was born at St David's Hospital in Carmarthen in 1980 and had moved to East London with my mum when I was just three months old,"" said Steven, a 43-year-old dad-of-four. ""Not long after that I was placed into care, all of which I didn't find out about until I was a teenager. ""Turns out I was named Jason Jones on my birth certificate and real mother was called Daphne - it was a real shock."" He added that the truth about his origins had been further muddied by social services having lost his adoption case file. ""In 2021 I did a DNA test that revealed I had a half-brother I never knew about - turns out he'd just done a similar test himself,"" said Steven, who had moved to Essex by that point. ""What is more, he was living barely 30 minutes up the road from me.""        That lead him to discover he also had a half-sister - one who knew of his mother's whereabouts. ""I was given an address in Bethnal Green, Tower Hamlets and I waited until the Covid restrictions had lifted before going over there,"" said Steven, a security officer. ""I wanted to impress Mum so I wore a suit and took a bunch of flowers, but when I arrived at her flat there was no answer and a pile of unopened mail on the doorstep.""    Walking round the back to investigate he discovered the rear door unlocked. ""I went inside and there she was, slumped on the bathroom floor. ""The neighbours told me she hadn't been seen for a week or two, so I'm guessing that's how long she'd been dead."" Daphne Morfydd Jones, a 62-year-old caterer, was cremated later that same month, with Steven organising the service and carrying the coffin, alongside his new-found half-siblings. In fact, he has since found out he's the eldest of eight children, with Daphne having another four boys and three girls in the years after he'd been born. The search for who is really is didn't stop there.             ""I now need to find my real dad to get some sort of closure,"" said Steven.  ""But all I know for sure is that his name's Frank and he was sent to prison, what for I don't know, not long after I'd been born. ""I think that's why I was given up, because my mum was struggling to cope on her own."" He added that Frank, if still alive, might have strong links with the traveller community in south Wales. ""I don't know if he realises Daphne's no longer with us, but I'd like to be able to let him know. ""Meeting him would be like putting in the final piece of the jigsaw.""

BBCNews_44,"Jonathan Roumie stars in Dallas Jenkins's wildly successful hit, The Chosen, the multi-season series about Jesus of Nazareth that raised nearly $100m from fans. It's one of the most successful crowdfunded entertainment projects ever, with its makers claiming that during four seasons of the series, viewer support raised nearly $100m in production expenses. But the chances are if you're not a US Christian, you might never have heard of The Chosen, the first multi-season series about Jesus of Nazareth, told through the eyes of his disciples and followers, as well as his opponents – as initially it was only available on its own platform, or through other Christian outlets. More like this: -       Band of Brothers is the last great 'uncool' TV show -       How Gone Girl impacted a shocking kidnapping case -       The female drug barons of Latin America From a small pilot in 2017, created by Illinois-born filmmaker Dallas Jenkins, with $11m raised from donors, The Chosen has sprouted into a production that can be watched on its own app, and on streamers including Netflix and Amazon. Its makers claim the series has had 200 million unique viewers across its platforms since launching. Season four had red carpet premieres in Los Angeles and London this week, to be followed by a limited cinema release (previous seasons pulled in around $35m at the US box office). The actor who plays Jesus, Jonathan Roumie, has met the Pope, twice, to talk about the series and his portrayal of Jesus. There haven't been many reviews of the series by mainstream rather than religious publications. A critic for The Atlantic, who also declare themselves to be a Christian, wrote: ""The show is good. I'd stop short of calling The Chosen a prestige drama, but it looks and feels downright secular."" The series is, however, all based on the gospel accounts of Jesus's life and ministry. In seasons one to three, he assembles his inner circle of disciples, delivers the so-called Sermon on the Mount, heals various people, including a woman who has been bleeding for 12 years, raises Jairus's daughter from the dead, and walks on water (excerpts released on social media show how the filmmakers recreate that miracle.) A modern take on the story of Jesus  Jesus of Nazareth has, of course, been portrayed many times on screen and stage, notably by Ted Neeley in 1973's Jesus Christ Superstar and by Jim Caviezel in Mel Gibson's ultra-violent but ultra-successful 2004 film, The Passion of the Christ. There was also a 1977 six-part TV mini-series, Jesus of Nazareth, made by Franco Zeffirelli. Martin Scorsese said recently that he'd finished another screenplay about Jesus; he also directed the controversial 1988 film The Last Temptation of Christ, where Jesus contemplates an ordinary life with Mary Magdalene. ""The West Wing was inspirational for us because it's about the presidency. The president is around whom these characters dwell, but he's one of five or six characters that are focused on. We thought the thing that you get when you read the gospels is that Jesus is having this impact on so many people, but if you don't know those people well, if you don't see life through their eyes, then the impact is minimised."" The fleshing out of characters has led to modern interpretations of dialogue and backstories in the show, perhaps most intriguingly seen in the character of one of the disciples, the gospel writer Matthew, who's portrayed as autistic. But unlike some of its predecessors (such as Jesus of Nazareth's blue-eyed Robert Powell), The Chosen has a diverse cast including actors who are of Jewish, Arab, Southeast Asian and North African descent. The story is rooted in Jewish life and customs of the time - also sometimes historically glossed over in the representations of Jesus. Jesus and his disciples are to be found in synagogues and celebrating Jewish festivals, such as Sukkot. ""There have been many Jesus movies and miniseries and I've seen almost all of them,"" Dallas Jenkins tells BBC Culture. ""But there's never been a multi-season show where you can take your time to develop the stories, develop the characters, develop backstories, where you can really explore the humanity of these people. The reason we love long-form series is because we can invest in the characters, invest in the story development, and that's never been done before in a Jesus project. Jonathan Roumie, a devout Catholic himself, insists of Jesus: ""You cannot strip away his Jewishness. It is imperative that all of what he did fulfilled the prophecies of Jewish culture of his time. So, I think to pretend it's not there does him and the story a disservice."" Jenkins says he hopes the tone of The Chosen is more human and humorous than has traditionally been the case for religious programming. ""We like to say that we're taking Jesus down from statues and stained-glass windows,"" he explains. ""I think that we are removing the veil and the walls that we've sometimes put up between us and the authentic Jesus. Even though we have lots of stuff in the show that isn't directly from scripture, I do believe we're accurately capturing the character and intentions of Jesus in the gospels. And I do think that does contribute to people who don't believe being able to appreciate the show. They just think: 'Okay, this doesn't feel so ominous and pious and religious that it's trying to sell me something, it feels like a historical drama'. "" But The Chosen does have evangelical intent as well; a foundation has been established that states it aims to maximise charitable giving to increase budgets for future seasons of the series, and to eventually subtitle and dub it into 600 languages. The series on The Chosen app and website is free to view, although there's the option to donate. The series isn't free from criticism by Christians. Scenes from series two showing Jesus practising the Sermon on the Mount weren't popular with some viewers, nor were scenes showing Mary Magdalene going back, temporarily, to her old lifestyle (there's a widespread belief that Mary Magdalene was a prostitute before meeting Jesus, although that's not in the gospels. Some Christians also thought that going back to an old way of life contravenes the message of salvation). Jenkins had to directly address a line in series three where Jesus says ""I am the law of Moses"" because some viewers thought the show was putting forward theology from the Book of Mormon, which carries a seemingly similar reference. Jenkins denied that the script was intentionally similar. Nor is it free from the politicisation of Christianity, especially in the US, where religious ideas on whether abortion should be legal, and the inclusion of LGBTQ+ people in churches, are part of mainstream debate. There was a flurry of controversy last year about the Pride flag being spotted on a piece of crew equipment on the set. ""The show isn't political. I don't have any political agenda,"" Jenkins says. ""That's why we allow freedom of expression on our set, why our cast and crew come from all different backgrounds politically, spiritually, or lack thereof. And if they want to wear T-shirts or have stuff on their own personal equipment, that's their business. ""I don't think it can remain free from audiences assigning certain politicisations to it, but that's just out of my control. So, we have people who have accused me of being a liberal feminist, and I've had people accuse me of being a far-right extremist.""   A US phenomenon?    And while its makers claim the show's had 600 million views across its various platforms, the popularity of The Chosen doesn't necessarily mean that there's a new era ahead for faith-based programming. Sound of Freedom, distributed by the Christian Angel Studios, one of the platforms where The Chosen can be seen, had huge theatrical success last year in the US, and went on to average between $1m and $3m in cinemas when released in places like France, Spain, the UK and the Netherlands. But it was perhaps aided by publicity associating the storyline about child traffickers with the QAnon conspiracy theory. There was also a ""Pay It Forward"" option in the US that allowed cinemagoers to buy extra tickets for someone else to claim for free. Otherwise, Christian content tends to struggle outside of the US. According to Tom Lashley from film industry analytics firm Gower Street, movies such as 2023's Jesus Revolution (also starring Jonathan Roumie), set during a spiritual awakening in 1970s California, made more than $50m in North America, but only around £200,000 in the UK. ""In terms of faith-based film, particularly the US-produced ones, they really don't make a dent outside of the box office in the US and Canada, even in predominantly Catholic European countries like Spain and Italy,"" he says. ""This could well be because religious films like Jesus Revolution, I Can Only Imagine or God's Not Dead are US-specialised and don't translate to outside of the US."" The Chosen's box office in Europe so far has also been small – Gower Street reports that a release of episodes seven and eight from season three a year ago in the UK made £53,000 – but it's starting to make an impact outside of the US on streaming platforms. It was the fourth most-watched show on Netflix in Brazil, and in the top 10 for all of Latin America, throughout the 2023 holiday period, according to show executives. ""I often describe this show has having a European style of filmmaking, it's a little bit rawer,"" Jenkins says. ""My cinematographer is Greek, and he brings that kind of approach in his style. I think stylistically we are European in our storytelling and in our filmmaking, we don't rush to easy answers. Hopefully slowly but surely audiences from elsewhere are starting to embrace the show and are saying to themselves: 'this doesn't feel like a glossy, kid-friendly 'Jesus' project, it does seem that it's something raw and real'."" Perhaps of course, The Chosen's appeal comes down to the fact that a well-written character portrayal of Jesus always has big audience potential amongst believers. The show's Facebook page has 3.8 million followers, and based on the interactions and comments, the majority seem to have a Christian faith. According to Jenkins, the fact the story can't go on indefinitely is a strength of the concept. It was, he says, always planned to run for seven seasons. ""And where we are now, is the beginning of the end,"" he says. ""I think that season six, which is the week of the crucifixion, is going to be so much more powerful than perhaps many portrayals I've seen in the past, because now there are stakes for the audience with the people involved. I don't even have to show blood and guts for us to be emotionally impacted by seeing Jesus, his friends, his mother, going through all of that. I'm just hoping we'll be able to get through it together."" Episodes of The Chosen season four will be released in cinemas in the US, Canada, UK and Ireland from 1 February. Streaming dates will be announced at a later date. The first season of The Chosen is available on Netflix.

BBCNews_45,"A ruling from the Alabama Supreme Court that frozen embryos are considered children, and that a person could be held liable for accidentally destroying them, has opened up a new front in the US battle over reproductive medicine. The decision has thrown the future of IVF treatments in the state into doubt, with a host of healthcare providers in the state suspending the service. Medical experts and reproductive advocacy groups warned the ruling could have negative consequences for fertility treatments in Alabama and beyond.  Some anti-abortion groups applauded the ruling, arguing that embryos deserve greater legal protections. The case stems from a wrongful death lawsuit brought by three couples whose embryos were lost at a fertility clinic in 2020. A patient had wandered into the place where the embryos were stored, handled them, and accidentally dropped them. As a result, the embryos were destroyed. The couples sought to sue the Center for Reproductive Medicine and the Mobile Infirmary Association under the state's Wrongful Death of a Minor Act. That law covers foetuses, but did not specifically cover embryos resulting from IVF. A lower court had ruled that the embryos did not qualify as a person or child, and that a wrongful death lawsuit could not move forward.  But in its ruling, the Alabama Supreme Court sided with the couples, and ruled that frozen embryos were considered ""children"".  The wrongful death law applied to ""all unborn children, regardless of their location"", the decision said. Concurring with the majority opinion, Chief Justice Tom Parker wrote: ""Even before birth, all human beings have the image of God, and their lives cannot be destroyed without effacing his glory."" The ruling does not ban or restrict IVF and in fact, the couples who brought the case actively sought out the procedure. But the decision may cause confusion about whether some aspects of IVF are legal under Alabama law, experts say. If an embryo is considered a person, it could raise questions about how clinics are allowed to use and store them. Elisabeth Smith, director of state policy at the Center for Reproductive Rights, told the BBC in a statement: ""Not all [IVF] embryos are used, nor can they be.  ""To enact legislation granting legal personhood to embryos could have disastrous consequences for the use of IVF - a science many people rely on to build their families.""  Ambiguity over the law could also extend to patients themselves, who may worry about whether the procedure remains available or legal. The Medical Association of the State of Alabama said in a statement: ""The significance of this decision impacts all Alabamians and will likely lead to fewer babies - children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews, and cousins - as fertility options become limited for those who want to have a family."" When the US Supreme Court struck down a nationwide right to abortion in 2022, it opened the door for states to make their own laws on the issue. Since the decision, Democratic-controlled states have expanded access while Republican-controlled states have restricted it. Alabama already has a total ban on abortion, at all stages of pregnancy. The White House called the Alabama ruling ""exactly the type of chaos that we expected when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade and paved the way for politicians to dictate some of the most personal decisions families can make"". Abortion opponents are also watching this ruling closely. The question of when an embryo or a foetus is legally considered a person is a factor in many state abortion restrictions. The Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal group, described the Alabama ruling as a ""tremendous victory for life"". ""No matter the circumstances, all human life is valuable from the moment of conception,"" spokeswoman Denise Burke said in a statement to the BBC. ""We are grateful the Court correctly found that Alabama law recognises this fundamental truth."" Other anti-abortion activists said IVF was not as clear-cut an ethical issue in their eyes, compared to terminating a pregnancy. Eric Johnston, a lawyer who helped draft Alabama's constitutional language on abortion in 2018, told the BBC: ""By and large the pro-life community would say that fertilised eggs are in need of protection."" But he acknowledged there were couples with anti-abortion views who had used IVF to have children, and said he would never condemn them. ""It's a dilemma, and a dilemma is something where you don't have a satisfactory answer,"" he added. Invitro fertilisation offers a possible solution where a woman faces challenges getting pregnant. Around 2% of US pregnancies are the result of IVF, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  The process involves retrieving the woman's eggs with a needle from her ovaries and combining them with a man's sperm in a lab. The fertilised embryo is then transferred into the woman's uterus, where it may create a pregnancy.  But the process is not guaranteed, and it can take multiple attempts to create a successful pregnancy.  In some cases, as in the Alabama trial, the fertilised embryos are frozen and stored in tanks containing liquid nitrogen. They can be held for up to a decade, experts say.   US states often tend to replicate each other's legislation, and the US has seen this pattern play out with abortion. Often, states will take cues from each other about what laws or policies have successfully passed legislatures or withstood legal challenges. Though the Alabama ruling only applies within the state, experts said other states could see legislative attempts or lawsuits aimed at advancing the concept that frozen embryos should legally be considered children or people. But they said it appeared unlikely this particular case would end up at the US Supreme Court, as the issue of abortion did, because the Alabama ruling originated in state court and concerns an interpretation of state, not federal, law. The right to abortion has been a winning issue for Democrats since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade, which guaranteed the constitutional right to abortion up to the point of foetal viability, about 23-25 weeks.  In the wake of the Alabama ruling, Democratic candidates could run on a platform of protecting access to fertility treatment across the United States. Republican politicians, meanwhile, often side with religious conservatives who want abortion banned or limited in the US. Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley, the only significant contender remaining in the race against Donald Trump for the party's nomination, initially endorsed the Alabama Supreme Court's decision on Thursday. But overnight she tried to walk back her initial reaction, telling reporters that she ""didn't say that I agreed with the Alabama ruling"", but she agreed that an embryo was ""considered an unborn baby"".  The man who burned himself in Washington DC is an active-duty US airman, local media report. After Alabama rules that frozen embryos are children, some fertility patients pray that lawmakers find a solution. The former president moves closer to the Republican nomination with a huge win in his rival's home state. The US says the allies targeted 18 sites, including missile storages, drones and radars.

BBCNews_46,"Greece has become the first Christian Orthodox-majority country to legalise same-sex marriage. Same-sex couples will now also be legally allowed to adopt children after Thursday's 176-76 vote in parliament. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the new law would ""boldly abolish a serious inequality"". But it has divided the country, with fierce resistance led by the powerful Orthodox Church. Its supporters held a protest rally in Athens. Many displayed banners, held crosses, read prayers and sang passages from the Bible in the capital's Syntagma Square. The head of the Orthodox Church, Archbishop Ieronymos, said the measure would ""corrupt the homeland's social cohesion"". The bill needed a simple majority to pass through the 300-member parliament. Mr Mitsotakis had championed the bill but required the support of opposition parties to get it over the line, with dozens of MPs from his centre-right governing party opposed.  ""People who have been invisible will finally be made visible around us, and with them, many children will finally find their rightful place,"" the prime minister told parliament during a debate ahead of the vote.  ""The reform makes the lives of several of our fellow citizens better, without taking away anything from the lives of the many."" The vote has been welcomed by LGBTQ organisations in Greece. ""This is a historic moment,"" Stella Belia, the head of same-sex parents' group Rainbow Families, told Reuters news agency. ""This is a day of joy.""  Fifteen of the European Union's 27 members have already legalised same-sex marriage. It is permitted in 35 countries worldwide.

BBCNews_47," The Daily Telegraph reports that the Health Secretary, Victoria Atkins, has indicated she would back decriminalising abortion after 24 weeks, one of two amendments to the law that MPs are due to vote on next month.  She has told the paper her voting record - on decriminalisation - speaks for itself, though she insists she will not pronounce publicly on the issue, so as not to influence MPs, who it is understood will be given a free vote.  The other amendment calls for a reduction of the legal time limit for abortion, from 24 weeks to 22. The Times, in an editorial, marks the two-year anniversary of the start of the war in Ukraine.  It urges western allies to give more weapons to Kyiv, or face the possibility of a humiliating defeat for Ukraine - and the West - in the third year of the war.  It is a point Boris Johnson also makes in the Daily Mail.  He argues that if Ukraine was given enough of the right weapons - particularly cruise missiles and shells - it could begin to make serious attacks on Crimea, which the former prime minister sees as vulnerable, and key to winning the war. The i newspaper says it has been told the UK is offering Russian officials British passports to defect and pass secrets to MI6.  British intelligence sources and a Russian informant said disgruntled members of Vladimir Putin's regime are being offered a new life in Britain if they will share information.  The Guardian carries criticism of the Conservative MP, Lee Anderson, for his suggestion on GB News that the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, had given the city away to Islamists.  It quotes the shadow exports minister, Tan Dhesi, as saying the remarks were deplorable, given the current rise in cases of Islamophobia and antisemitism.  The Times says that a leading pro-Palestinian activist wanted to create a protest that made Parliament, ""have to lock its doors"" amid concerns about MPs' safety.  According to the Daily Express, Esther Rantzen's campaign to force a vote on assisted dying has taken a step forward, with the government saying it would allow MPs to decide on changing the law. The veteran activist has stage-four cancer, and wants to die without pain. The Telegraph reports that the Ministry of Defence has been accused of ""betrayal"" because of a plan to change the rules on military accommodation. From next month, for the first time, the size of living quarters allocated to service personnel will depend on the number of people in their family, not their rank, with more senior officers traditionally receiving larger homes.   The paper says a petition organised by army wives calling for a review of the policy has received 16,000 signatures. And the Times, Telegraph and Express all feature photos of a smiling King, at a table at Buckingham Palace, reading some of the 7,000 cards he was sent after his cancer diagnosis. So too does the Daily Mirror which says the cards have lifted his spirits. Its headline... King and Tonic. Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox. Copyright 2024 BBC.

BBCNews_48,"Ministers have been accused of kicking plans for protest buffer zones around abortion clinics ""into the long grass"", after it was announced they would not be implemented until next spring. A law to introduce buffer zones in England and Wales was passed in May. But the government said it was launching a consultation on guidance before buffer zones could be enforced. The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) said it was ""disappointed but not surprised"" by the delay. The charity is the leading provider of abortion advice and treatment in the UK, with more than 55 reproductive healthcare clinics across the country.  Rachael Clarke, chief of staff at BPAS, told the BBC: ""It seems like all they are doing is once again kicking it into the long grass. And in the meantime women are going to continue to suffer."" Buffer zones would prevent demonstrations within 150 metres of an abortion clinic.  Ms Clarke said that since the law was passed more than six months ago, protests had continued ""unabated"", with at least 16 clinics targeted. BPAS said examples included a man protesting in a waiting room and refusing to leave and individuals standing outside a clinic with graphic signs showing foetuses.  Ms Clarke argued there was no need for guidance or a consultation as the law was closely worded with similar measures already implemented in Northern Ireland, which the Supreme Court ruled did not ""disproportionately interfere"" with protesters' rights. She added that she was concerned guidance could weaken protections for women, for example by allowing ""peaceful prayer"" outside clinics, which she said caused ""the vast majority of distress, alarm and harassment"".  On Monday, Home Office minister Lord Sharpe told peers: ""The government will issue non-statutory guidance to ensure law enforcement agencies have a clear, consistent understanding around enforcement, and abortion service providers and protesters are clear as to what is expected under the new law."" He said a consultation on the guidance would be launched ""imminently"" to ensure the legislation could be implemented effectively from spring next year. Lord Sharpe added: ""This is new legislation on an emotive topic and there are strong views on all sides of the debate, and determining the appropriate balance will not always be straightforward."" However, Labour MP Stella Creasy, who first proposed the measures to introduce buffer zones, said launching a consultation was ""a stalling tactic"".  ""A woman's right to access an abortion in peace without being harassed should be straightforward - Parliament voted for it,"" she said. ""And yet we can see the government putting up hurdles."" She said buffer zones had already undergone scrutiny before the law was passed and guidance was available on Public Spaces Protection Orders, which allow councils to prohibit specified activities within a defined area.  Some councils have already used such orders to introduce local buffer zones around abortion clinics. But campaigners says this can take a significant amount of time and money to introduce and have called for a nation-wide solution. Christian Concern, which is involved in a legal challenge against a buffer zone around an abortion clinic in Bournemouth, said it welcomed the consultation.  Chief executive Andrea Williams said: ""Buffer zones set a dangerous precedent and are being weaponised to silence debate and prevent women accessing any alternatives to abortion."" Under section 9 of the Public Order Act, which was passed in May, harassing, obstructing or interfering with anyone attending an abortion clinic, within a 150 metre ""safe access zone"", was made a criminal offence carrying an unlimited fine. The measure had cross-party support, although it was opposed by some senior politicians including Minister for Women and Equalities Kemi Badenoch and then-Home Secretary Suella Braverman.  A similar bill has also been published in Scotland but it has not yet become law.  The victims were killed in separate, unrelated incidents in the Austrian capital on Friday. The dress is included in an exhibition at Leeds' Thackray Museum of Medicine. Data shows half of the referrals in 2023 resulted in no treatment.

BBCNews_49,"Adopters are needed to ensure brothers and sisters in South Yorkshire are able to stay together. One Adoption South Yorkshire, the area's regional adoption agency, said there are 33 children in sibling groups in need of a family. The agency said brothers and sisters tend to wait longer for an adoptive family. It said adopting a sibling group meant parents only had to go through the process once to complete their family. Stephanie Evans, head of One Adoption South Yorkshire, said: ""We're asking the people of South Yorkshire to consider keeping brothers and sisters together by giving them the loving, stable, permanent home they need."" She said there were lots of positives to adopting siblings. ""Children adopted together are more likely to settle into their new home quickly, develop key social skills like sharing, as well as nurturing their own identity and sibling bond. ""It also means you only have to go through the adoption process once to create your family."" She said the agency welcomed adopters from all backgrounds and said prospective parents are supported throughout the process. Ms Evans added said it was a ""huge decision"" for anyone. ""At times it is challenging, as parenthood is for everyone, but adoption is an incredibly rewarding and positive experience, and our team is always on hand to offer support and answer your questions.""

BBCNews_50,"The US Supreme Court has agreed to hear a legal challenge that could undo hundreds of charges relating to the Capitol riot on 6 January 2021. On Wednesday, it said its justices would review the charge of obstruction of an official proceeding. Some 300 people have been charged with that statute for alleged crimes committed during the Capitol riot. Former President Donald Trump is also charged with that count in the federal investigation being led by Jack Smith. The top court's eventual decision could upend all of those charges and potentially delay the start of Mr Trump's trial on 4 March. The man who brought the appeal, Joseph Fischer, says the law has been applied incorrectly against people charged over their involvement in the riot.  Federal prosecutors say Mr Fischer was one of thousands who participated in the attack on Congress to prevent it from carrying out the certification of the 2020 election results. He claims that the law, which was created in the wake of an accounting scandal in 2002 to prevent corporate malfeasance during trials, has been unreasonably stretched to apply to those charged over the violence.  Lawyers for Mr Fischer say those who stormed the Capitol were not acting ""corruptly"" as the law demands. Instead, they say rioters were protesting what they honestly believed to be a stolen election.  But the justice department has argued that ""official proceeding"" could refer to a proceeding of Congress. The Supreme Court's decision to hear the matter could have consequences for Special Counsel Jack Smith's prosecution of Mr Trump for his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.  In August, Mr Smith charged the former president with obstruction of an official proceeding and three other federal crimes. Mr Trump pleaded not guilty to the charges and claimed he was the victim of a political ""witch hunt"".  Mr Fischer's attorneys' specifically noted the connection in their petition to the court. The case ""presents an important question of federal law affecting hundreds of prosecutions arising from January 6, including the prosecution of former President Donald Trump,"" they wrote. Earlier, a US District Court judge ruled in favour of Mr Fischer and two others charged in connection to the riot, but a subsequent appeals court voted 2-1 to overturn that ruling.  Appellate Judge Florence Pan wrote that the Justice Department's ""broad interpretation of the statute…is unambiguous and natural"". Her colleague, Judge Gregory Katsas, dissented, writing the government was ""mistaken"" and that its interpretation ""hard to reconcile"" with the history of the statute.  In September, Mr Fischer had asked the US Supreme Court to consider his case. The court agreed to hear it in a series of announcements on Wednesday, which also included a high-profile abortion pill case. Those following the federal Capitol riot investigation will be closely watching the Supreme Court as it weighs Mr Fischer's case. It marks the second 6 January-related case to come before the Supreme Court in recent days. On Monday, the justices agreed to hear arguments about whether Mr Trump could be prosecuted for crimes he allegedly committed during his presidency. US justices heard arguments about Trump's presidentially eligibility after Colorado disqualified him. Justices intensely questioned attorneys who argued he should be removed from Colorado's primary ballot. Conservatives hold a 6-3 majority on top court, which has the final word on highly contentious laws. On Thursday, the Supreme Court will hear the former president's appeal after Colorado ruled he couldn't run for president there. The former president loses a landmark legal bid to shield him from charges of election fraud. Copyright 2024 BBC.

BBCNews_51,"The former finance secretary, Kate Forbes, has urged the Scottish government not to appeal a court decision to uphold the UK government's block on gender reform.  Ms Forbes said politicians should work to ""heal divisions not exacerbate them"".  She said a reformed bill should safeguard the rights of trans people as well as women and girls.  The Scottish government has three weeks to decide whether or not to appeal.  Writing on X, formerly Twitter, Ms Forbes said she urged the Scottish government ""not to prolong the legal battle further"" over the Gender Recognition (Reform) Bill.  She said: ""I previously argued that Scot Gov shouldn't contest S35 unless there was a v high chance of success.  ""A loss for Scot Gov would obvs absorb public funds but could also embolden future UK Govs to interfere in devolution, which no party of independence wishes to see."" She added that the legal process ""has created a period of great uncertainty and fear for trans people and women and girls, deepening already bitter divisions"". She also warned that losing an appeal at this stage could ""embolden"" future UK governments to ""interfere in devolution"". Her intervention comes a day after judges at the Court of Session in Edinburgh ruled that the UK government acted lawfully in blocking Scotland's gender self-ID reforms. The legislation, which is designed to make it easier for people to change their legally-recognised sex, was passed by the Scottish Parliament last year. The UK government blocked it from becoming law over fears it would impact on equality laws across the rest of the UK. Friday's Court of Session ruling rejected a Scottish government legal challenge to the veto. If the Scottish government now decides to appeal against the ruling, the case could ultimately end up in the Supreme Court in London. The legislation received cross-party support in Holyrood, passing by 86 votes to 39. Opponents of the reforms warned the legislation could risk the safety of women and girls in same-sex spaces such as hospital wards and refuges. Supporters argued it would make the process of obtaining a gender recognition certificate (GRC) easier and less traumatic for trans people. Ms Forbes came a close second in the SNP leadership contest after the resignation of Nicola Sturgeon earlier this year. A member of the Free Church of Scotland, she has spoken of experiencing a backlash against her religious views. She has previously said she would not have voted for the Scottish government's gender reform bill in its current form. In February she told BBC Scotland she had ""significant concerns"" about gender self-identification. In response to interview questions during her campaign, she said the idea of having children outside of marriage conflicted with her Christian faith and confirmed that she was anti-abortion. Ms Forbes also said she would not have voted for same-sex marriage if she had been a politician in 2014 when the law passed. The Gender Recognition (Reform) Bill is a central part of the Bute House Agreement, which brought Green co-leaders Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater into government with the SNP as ministers. The Green MSP Maggie Chapman told the BBC she believed the Scottish government ought to appeal Friday's ruling to protect both devolution and the rights of trans people. ""Getting reform of the Gender Recognition Act through the Scottish Parliament is a cornerstone of the Bute House Agreement that the Scottish Greens have with the Scottish government,"" she said. ""But it is really, really important that we give all seven MSPs, the wider Green Party membership as well, the opportunity to have contributions to the conversation."" The party wants another debate on the conflict, after a vote on Wednesday descended into chaos. Freedom of speech jostles with safety concerns as MPs weigh up the complexities of the Israel-Gaza conflict.

BBCNews_52,"George Santos walked the halls of Capitol Hill for less than a year as a congressman before his colleagues expelled him last December over allegations of fraud.  Voting is now under way to pick his successor in New York's Third Congressional District, with the Republican and Democratic parties pouring millions of dollars into the race that ends on Tuesday.  Former Congressman Tom Suozzi is running as the Democrat and local official Mazi Pilip, a black Israeli-American who served in the Israel Defence Forces, is the Republican candidate. The winner will represent parts of New York City and Long Island, and polls show the race is neck-and-neck.  Mr Santos' antics may have dominated Washington for months, but voters in this district appear more focused on issues that will likely be a factor in the forthcoming presidential race - the Israel-Hamas war, immigration, and abortion. Both parties are now testing their political messaging in this swing district. With a razor-thin margin in the House of Representatives, Republicans are eager to win the race to more easily pass their legislative priorities before the election. Democrats, meanwhile, want to secure the seat to help their growing coalition and to gain traction before November.  Following the 7 October Hamas attacks, both parties have vowed to back Israel. But in this district, which boasts a large Jewish population, that support could prove crucial to winning the special election.  The issue is so important for both candidates that they appeared together at a January event in support of the Israeli hostages being held by Hamas. ""Your pain, our pain,"" Ms Pilip said to attendees. Ms Pilip is an Orthodox Jew who fled her home country of Ethiopia to Israel in 1991 to escape discrimination and later moved to the US. Recruited by the local Republican Party, she has represented Great Neck - a wealthy community in Long Island - in the Nassau County legislature since 2022.  Mr Suozzi declared in February that he was ""unequivocally pro-Israel"" and condemned the recent failure by Congress to pass aid for Israel. He travelled to Israel just before Christmas to further illustrate his support.  Jared Konsker, a 33-year-old Jewish voter in the district, told the BBC that he is backing Ms Pilip because she is a ""bigtime supporter of Israel, which is crucial in the time we're living in right now"". Not all Jewish voters are basing their vote solely on Israel, however. Ben Marzouk, a local Republican who was part of a grassroots effort to oust Mr Santos, said he was backing Mr Suozzi because of his experience in government. The record number of migrants crossing the US southern border has become a key driver for American voters this year, and the candidates in this special election are not ignoring it. Ms Pilip has sought to tie New York City's influx of migrants and the border crisis to Mr Suozzi and the Democratic party. Anthony D'Esposito, a Republican congressman who represents a neighbouring district and is a key surrogate for Ms Pilip, said the race was ""a referendum on policies that have failed the American people, in a district that is legitimately thousands of miles from the southern border"". In turn, Mr Suozzi has blamed Republicans in Congress for failing to pass a bipartisan legislative package that would have reduced border crossings and limited asylum. The former congressman has not ignored the problem but ""leaned into"" it, according to Jay Jacobs, chair of the New York State Democratic Party. Abortion has proved a winning issue for Democrats since the US Supreme Court ruled in June 2022 that state governments can choose to ban the procedure. Ms Pilip, a mother of seven, has tried to thread the needle on the issue. At a televised debate on Thursday, she said that every woman should be able to make her own choice.  ""I'm not going to force my own belief to any woman,"" she said, though she later admitted that she opposed abortion - a comment Mr Suozzi seized upon. Vivian Brash, 65, and her husband, both Great Neck residents, were torn on which candidate to support due to ""the Israel cause"".  They chose to vote for Mr Suozzi because of the abortion issue.  ""We have a daughter, we have granddaughters,"" Ms Brash told the BBC. ""It's important for women to make their own decisions."" Republicans want to move past the debacle that was their last congressman and Democrats have found that voters are not moved by using Mr Santos - who faces a multi-count federal indictment for money laundering, fraud and other charges - as a political cudgel. ""We've been without representation for so long, there's been a hunger to actually talk about the issues,"" said Kimberly Garber Keiserman, who led a grassroots voter group that formed to remove Mr Santos from office.  Still, it is inarguable that Mr Santos is looming over the race. Mr Suozzi and his allies have cast Ms Pilip as ""Santos 2.0"" and reminded voters what happens when they choose a candidate with a short political resume. Ms Pilip has been accused by her opponent of not engaging enough with the public and the press, which has fed accusations that she, like Mr Santos, lacks transparency.  But she maintains any parallels to Mr Santos are all created by Mr Suozzi. ""He wants to create these feelings of me and Santos in the same place,"" Ms Pilip said recently on Fox News. ""Come on, let's focus on the real issues."" The man who burned himself in Washington DC is an active-duty US airman, local media report. After Alabama rules that frozen embryos are children, some fertility patients pray that lawmakers find a solution.

BBCNews_53,"In her garden in northern Athens, four-year-old Niovi plays make-believe, selling cakes from her imaginary shop.  For her two mums, Christina Leimoni and Victoria Kalfaki, their dream may soon become real, as Greece stands on the brink of legalising same-sex marriage. Parliament will vote on the bill, introduced by Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, on Thursday. Facing dissent from members of his own centre-right party, he will need to rely on support from the left-wing opposition to get it through. Christina and Victoria will be there inside the chamber, willing it to pass. Two years ago, they returned to Greece from the UK, where they had moved for work - and to live their relationship freely. They married in the UK and Niovi was born there. If the law passes, they plan to have their marriage recognised under Greek law. After Niovi's birth in London, they tried to register her at the Greek embassy, but were rebuffed. ""The commentary was, 'You should have thought before having her',"" Christina recalls. ""It was awful, I cried in the car for 45 minutes, I couldn't stop - it still brings bad memories,"" Victoria says, welling up with tears. ""It's like being rejected by your country."" Without legal recognition for their marriage in Greece, only Victoria, who gave birth to Niovi, is accepted as her mother, even though the egg was from Christina. At school, she has no say over decisions and when Niovi has been admitted to hospital, Christina has been barred from entering her room. ""My biggest fear is that if anything really bad happens to Victoria and she dies, our child instantly goes to social services, who then see if any of Victoria's relatives want to adopt her,"" she says. ""If they don't, she goes into an institution. I have no say. So the child wouldn't just lose one mother, she'd lose both of us."" Fifteen of the European Union's 27 members have already legalised same-sex marriage. It is permitted in 35 countries worldwide.  Greece has lagged behind European neighbours largely because of opposition from its powerful church. If the law passes this week, it would become the first Christian Orthodox-majority country, and the first in Europe's southeast, to have marriage equality. Same-sex couples would also be legally allowed to adopt children but not to have a baby through a surrogate - a recourse that is only legal here for heterosexual couples who have a medical need for assisted reproduction. ""Greece geographically is in the southeast, but culturally and politically it belongs to the West,"" says Alex Patelis, the prime minister's chief economic advisor and a member of the committee that drafted the marriage bill. Mr Mitsotakis, recently storming to re-election, faces a weak opposition that has left him the space to tread onto their political turf without jeopardising his own position. Mr Patelis says the bill is a cornerstone of the prime minister's beliefs: ""It's often thought that human rights and equality are the purview of the parties of the left. This is coming from a centre-right party - and it's important to recognise that equality under law and individual rights are also the ideology of the right."" But Greek society is split. A recent poll for Proto Thema newspaper found 55% in favour of same-sex marriage and an even slimmer majority backing adoption. Up to 50 of Mr Mitsotakis's 158 MPs are expected either to vote against the bill or to be conveniently absent from the chamber, meaning they can duck the vote. A letter by the Church of Greece opposing the move was read out in morning mass across the country earlier this month, condemning what it said would ""promote the abolition of fatherhood and motherhood… and put the sexual choices of homosexual adults above the interests of future children"". One of the most outspoken prelates has been Bishop Seraphim of Piraeus. At the city's Agii Anargiri Church, we watch as he leads a packed service, with worshippers in their Sunday best kissing icons and bowing heads. He recently warned that he would block MPs who back the bill from his church, adding it would be preferable if they had not been born.  And, he said, he would refuse to baptise children of same-sex couples ""to help them understand that what their guardians are doing is a sin."" Outside parliament on Syntagma Square, opponents gather to protest against the bill, beneath banners reading ""No children for perverts"" and chanting ""Take your hands off our kids"". A video shows images including religious icons and, oddly, Bill Gates. Conspiracy theories about a new global order being imposed on Greece have blended with pious Greeks who believe their traditions are being destroyed. ""The Bible says marriage is between a man and a woman - and anything else is a big sin,"" says Rallou Perperidou.  ""Like Sodom and Gomorrah, God destroyed people practising homosexuality. God will forgive them if they accept what they do is wrong and denounce it."" Kyriaki Chantzara, 38, is at the protest with her sister, who is expecting her tenth child.  ""Homosexual people cannot give the right example for children because we think the existence of a female and male example is crucial to them. It is a human right for every child to have a father and a mother,"" she says. Back in northern Athens, four-year-old Niovi is practising her English with nursery rhymes. Her mums help as she reads ""Hickory Dickory Dock, the mouse ran up the clock…"" As time ticks towards the parliamentary vote, the women say their excitement is building. ""I'm amazingly happy about it,"" says Christina.  ""It's the start of accepting diversity in general as a country and accepting that all people have equal rights. And for us it will mean reality, because I am Niovi's mother, and this should be supported by the law. The legislation will bring truth to the reality.""

BBCNews_54,"TB Joshua, a charismatic Nigerian leader of one of the world's biggest evangelical churches, secretly committed sexual crimes on a mass scale, a BBC investigation spanning three continents has found. Testimony from dozens of survivors suggests Joshua was abusing and raping young women from around the world several times a week for nearly 20 years. Warning: Contains accounts of torture, rape and self-harm  In early 2002, in the depths of a grey English winter, 21-year-old Rae disappeared. The last time many of her friends saw her was at university in Brighton. She had been studying graphic design, living in a shared house 25 minutes from the sea. Rae was bright and popular.  ""For me, it was like she died, but I couldn't grieve her,"" says Carla, Rae's best friend at the time. Carla knew where Rae had gone. But the truth of it was hard to explain to their friends. A few weeks previously, she and Rae had travelled to Nigeria together, in search of a mysterious man who could seemingly heal people with his hands. He was a Christian pastor, with a black beard, in white robes. His name was TB Joshua. His followers called him ""The Prophet"". Rae and Carla planned to visit his church, the Synagogue Church of All Nations [Scoan], for just one week. But Rae never came home. She had moved into Joshua's compound. ""I left her there,"" says Carla, tears flowing freely. ""Never will I ever forgive myself for that."" The church looms like a gothic temple over the Ikotun neighbourhood in Lagos, Africa's largest city. Joshua designed all 12 storeys of the compound adjoining it, where he lived alongside many of his followers. He oversaw the construction of the multiple staircases to his bedroom. The three doors to it, in and out. The hidden prayer room full of tiny mirrors. The ""clinic"" downstairs. We have interviewed many people who lived inside. They paint a picture of a concrete labyrinth; a nightmarish world where reality slipped away and horrors unfolded. Numerous women say they were sexually assaulted by Joshua, with a number claiming they were repeatedly raped behind closed doors. Some say they were forced to have abortions after becoming pregnant. Today, Rae is back in England, living in a beautiful hamlet in the countryside. She's smiley and laughs freely, but there's something restless about her. ""On the outside I look normal, but I'm not,"" she says. When Rae talks about her years in Lagos, her lips tighten. She talks breathlessly. At times, the colour visibly drains from her face. She spent 12 years inside Joshua's compound. ""This story is like a horror story. It's like something you watch in fiction, but it's true."" The two-year investigation, in collaboration with international media platform openDemocracy, has involved more than 15 BBC journalists across three continents. They gathered archive video recordings, documents, and hundreds of hours of interviews to corroborate Rae's testimony and uncover further harrowing stories. More than 25 eyewitnesses and alleged victims, from the UK, Nigeria, Ghana, US, South Africa and Germany, have provided accounts of what it was like inside Joshua's compound, with the most recent experiences in 2019. The Synagogue Church of All Nations did not respond to the allegations, but said previous claims have been unfounded. Former followers have previously tried to speak out about abuse, but say they have been silenced or discredited by Scoan, and two say they were physically assaulted. When the BBC's Africa Eye was filming outside the church, a security guard shot above the heads of the crew after they refused to hand over their material. Many of our interviewees have waived their legal right to anonymity, in most cases asking just their surnames be omitted. Others asked that their identities remain hidden for fear of reprisals. The man at the heart of Scoan is regarded as one of the most influential pastors in African history. He died, unexpectedly, in June 2021, just days after many of our first interviews were recorded. On the day of his funeral, Lagos ground to a halt as mourning crowds packed the streets.  Some 50,000 people would attend Joshua's services every week, and the church became a top site for foreign visitors to Nigeria. His global television and social media empire was among the most successful Christian networks in the world, with millions of viewers spanning Europe, the Americas, South East Asia and Africa. His YouTube channel had hundreds of millions of views. The church is still popular today, led by his widow Evelyn and a new team of disciples.  An interview with Nelson Mandela's daughter in 2013 shows a portrait of Joshua sitting on the former president of South Africa's desk. In his lifetime, Joshua attracted dozens of politicians and celebrities to his church, including sporting legends such as Chelsea FC striker Didier Drogba and at least nine African presidents.

And for more information on cults, please see The Family Survival Trust Many of his followers were drawn by his philanthropy, but most came for his so-called miracles. Joshua systematically filmed spectacular ""healings"" throughout his career. After Joshua prayed for them, individuals on camera testified to being cured of ailments ranging from cancer and HIV/Aids, to chronic migraines and blindness. ""We'd never… seen anything like that before,"" says Solomon Ashoms, a journalist who covers African religion.  ""The mysteries that he had, the secrets that he carried, [were] what people followed.""  A number of Joshua's videos show men with severely infected genitals, which burst open and then miraculously heal when he raises his arm in prayer. Others show women struggling to give birth, who instantaneously deliver their children when Joshua approaches. After each event, those involved would testify to being saved.  Video tapes of Joshua's healings were circulating among evangelical churches throughout Europe and Africa in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Rae, who had grown up with conservative Christian values, was inspired to travel to Lagos after watching these videos, shown to her by a South African acquaintance. ""I was gay and I didn't want to be,"" she says. ""I thought: 'Well, maybe this is the answer to my problems. Maybe this man can straighten me out. Like if he prays for me, I won't be gay any more.'"" Another British woman, Anneka, from Derby, in the Midlands, says she was also entranced by the videos.  ""The whole room went completely still,"" she says, describing the moment her church congregation first encountered the tapes when she was 16. ""This is what Jesus would have done,"" she remembers thinking. She, too, went on to travel to Nigeria. Neither Rae nor Anneka, nor many of the young people who left their home countries to meet Joshua in the early 2000s, paid for their tickets. Church groups across England raised funds to send pilgrims to Lagos to witness these miracles - and Joshua contributed Scoan money himself, senior former church insiders say. Later, once the church was well established, he charged high prices for pilgrims to come and stay.  Bisola, a Nigerian who spent 14 years inside the compound, says courting Westerners was a key tactic.  ""He used the white people to market his brand,"" she says. Former insiders estimate Joshua made tens of millions of dollars from pilgrims and other money streams - fundraising, video sales, and stadium appearances abroad. He rose from poverty to become one of Africa's richest pastors. ""That guy [was] a genius,"" says Agomoh Paul, a man once regarded as Joshua's number two in the church, who left after 10 years in the compound. ""Everything… [he did was] planned out."" A major part of this planning was the faking of the ""miracles"" says Agomoh Paul, which he says he oversaw. He and other sources say that those ""cured"" had often been paid to perform or exaggerate their symptoms before their supposed healing took place. In some cases, they say, people had been unknowingly drugged or given medicine to improve their conditions while at the church, and later persuaded to give testimony about their recovery. Others were falsely told they had tested positive for HIV/Aids and that, thanks to Joshua's ministrations, they had now become virus-free. When Rae landed in the seething heat of Lagos, she saw miracles too. Dozens of people came and testified to having been healed of serious illnesses. ""I had a really involuntary reaction. I just broke down in floods of tears,"" she says. It was then that Rae was chosen. Joshua singled her out to become a ""disciple"" - an elite group of followers who served him and lived with him inside his compound. Rae thought she was going to study under Joshua, to ""cure"" her sexuality, to learn how to heal people. The reality was very different. ""We all thought we were in heaven, but we were in hell,"" she says. ""And in hell terrible things happen."" Disciples: The Cult of TB Joshua A shocking journey into a maze of manipulation and terrifying abuse perpetrated by one of the most powerful religious figures of the 21st Century Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK only) or on the BBC Africa YouTube channel (outside UK) World of Secrets - The Disciples A nine-episode season - a shocking journey into a maze of manipulation and terrifying abuse Listen now on BBC Sounds  Sixteen of the former disciples we interviewed, including Rae, provided first-hand testimony of sexual assault or rape by Joshua. Many say it happened frequently - as much as two to four times a week - for the duration of their time in the compound. Some described violent rapes which left them struggling to breath or bleeding. Many believed they were the only ones being assaulted and did not dare share what was happening to them with the other disciples, as they were all encouraged to report on each other. According to Victoria, who asked us to change her name for safety reasons, and who spent more than five years in the compound, other sexual assault victims were often hand picked by Joshua from the church congregation. She says she was picked out while attending the church's Sunday school, and says she was raped in Joshua's private quarters a few months later, after her parents entrusted her into his care. She was then recruited as a resident disciple. Victoria says Joshua ordered some of his most trusted Nigerian disciples to help identify new victims. The group was informally known as the ""fishing department"" and she says it ultimately coerced her into joining. Another disciple involved in similar recruitment was Bisola.  ""TB Joshua asked me to recruit virgins for him… So that he could bring them into the disciple-fold and disvirgin them,"" she says. She participated because of both ""indoctrination"" and threats of violence, she says, adding she herself was repeatedly raped by Joshua. A number of women say they were under the age of legal of consent - which is 18 in Lagos state - when they were sexually assaulted or raped. This offence can lead to the death penalty in Nigeria. Jessica Kaimu, now a broadcast journalist in Namibia, says she was just 17 and a virgin when Joshua raped her in the bathroom of his penthouse, within weeks of her becoming a disciple.  ""I was screaming and he was whispering in my ear that I should stop acting like a baby… I was so traumatised, I couldn't cry,"" she says. Jessica says this encounter was repeated again and again, throughout the five years she spent as a disciple. Her account mirrors that of other women who spoke to the BBC, and also of accounts by four of Joshua's male personal servants who were given the job of clearing up the physical evidence of this abuse. Many of the details of our interviewees' accounts are too graphic to publish. They include multiple first-hand accounts of women being stripped naked, and raped with objects - including one woman who says it happened to her twice before the age of 15.  ""It was so painful, he violated me,"" the woman, who asked to remain anonymous, says. ""Words cannot properly express it. It scarred me for life."" A number of interviewees who say they were raped and became pregnant by Joshua, explain how they were also then given forced abortions inside the compound - in an area known as the ""medical department"" or ""clinic"". ""It would all be done in secrecy,"" says Sihle, a South African former disciple, who says she had three forced abortions in the church.  ""You are given a concoction to drink and you get sick. Or they put these metal pieces in your vagina and they extract whatever. And you don't know whether they're [accidentally] pulling out your womb."" Sihle wept throughout her interview, as did Jessica who says she was given five forced abortions. Bisola says she witnessed ""dozens"" of abortions during her 14 years inside the church. At times, she says she would climb to the highest floor of the compound and cry, begging God to save her.  The disciples served Joshua's every need. They gave him massages, helped him dress, sprayed perfume when he entered the room. They placed plastic gloves on his hands so he could eat his food without touching a crumb. Rather than call him by his name, they were all encouraged to address him as ""Daddy"". It's not uncommon for a Nigerian pastor in the Pentecostal tradition to be addressed this way, but the disciples say it was a term Joshua insisted on. ""My mind was like it had been shaken,"" says Anneka. ""There was no cognitive clarity at all... Reality was skewed completely."" The physical design of the compound deepened their disorientation.  ""It was a maze of staircases,"" says Rae.  In 2014, the construction cost lives. A six-storey guest house built for international guests collapsed, killing at least 116 people.  A subsequent local government report found structural failure and shoddy building work to be the cause of the collapse. No-one has ever been prosecuted. Some of our interviewees told us they believe the death toll was significantly higher than reported, explaining that a number of Nigerian nationals who had been working on the guesthouse were not listed as victims, and that church members had botched rescue attempts and hidden bodies at night. They say Joshua also prevented the emergency services from assisting rescue efforts in the immediate aftermath, ever aware of his public profile. His grip on communication was always tight, our sources say. Rae says it was only after she left that she realised that her family and friends had been sending her emails. She had never received them. Joshua restricted disciples' access to phones and email accounts, our interviewees say. ""He wanted to control everybody, everything,"" says Agomoh Paul. ""What he was really scrambling for [was] the control of people's minds."" The disciples say they were made to work, without pay, for long hours each day - running all aspects of the megachurch. All say sleep deprivation was routine, with lights left on in the dormitories at night.  Anneka says they never had more than four hours of sleep at a time. If anyone was caught napping without permission, or contravening any other of Joshua's rules, they would be punished. Nineteen former disciples described witnessing violent attacks or torture within the compound, carried out by Joshua or on his orders.  Other disciples described being stripped and whipped themselves, with electrical cables and a horse whip known as a koboko. Among those allegedly targeted in this way were trainee disciples as young as seven. The compound in Lagos had 12ft-high [3.7m] walls and armed guards. But what really kept the disciples there was the fanatical loyalty he generated, and deep-rooted fears instilled by Joshua about what might happen to them if they did escape. ""It was a psychological prison,"" says Rae. ""It's extremely difficult to understand how somebody can go through psychological abuse to the extent that they lose their critical thinking."" ""Scoan fits the definition of a cult rather precisely,"" says Dr Alexandra Stein, an honorary fellow at the University of Sussex and member of The Family Survival Trust, which raises public awareness of cult groups.  She has encountered multiple Scoan survivors, and says Joshua isolated his victims, putting them through ""coercively controlling processes of stress, fear, guilt and shame"". She adds this meant they became too frightened to leave. All the BBC interviewees spoke of ""brainwashing"", ""indoctrination"" and ""mind control"" - and many described life as a disciple under Joshua as like being in a ""cult"". Rae says for her, it is the psychological torture that has left the deepest scars. She says Joshua subjected her to a form of punishment known as ""adaba"" for two years, during which she was forbidden from leaving the compound, and nobody inside was allowed to talk to her. ""I was basically in total isolation… I had a complete breakdown,"" she says. ""I tried to commit suicide five times."" In being pushed to the brink, something cracked in Rae's mind. Twelve years of indoctrination began to unravel. ""He made a huge mistake, he lost control of me,"" she says. While travelling with the church on a tour to Mexico, Rae slipped away from the disciples. She never went back.  Her life is now very different. But she has to live with the disappointment that there is no way to hold Joshua to account. ""TB Joshua dying before facing justice for the atrocities he committed, has been deeply frustrating. It's only added to the gross sense of injustice felt by all of us as his victims."" We contacted Scoan with the allegations in our investigation. They did not respond to them, but denied previous claims against TB Joshua.  ""Making unfounded allegations against Prophet TB Joshua is not a new occurrence… None of the allegations was ever substantiated,"" they wrote.

BBCNews_55,"The police are investigating up to 50 potential breaches of laws providing safe access zones (SAZs) outside abortion clinics in Northern Ireland.  The zones came into effect in September at eight clinics in Northern Ireland. More incidents were reported at Causeway Hospital in Coleraine than any other site, police figures show. That has prompted pro-choice campaigners and some local politicians to call for the zones to be extended by up to 250m (820ft). In a statement, the Northern Trust said it would keep the width of the zone under review. Warning: This article contains images which some readers may find distressing. The legislation, which was passed at Stormont in 2022, makes it illegal for people to be ""impeded, recorded, influenced or to be caused harassment, alarm or distress"" within the eight areas. It is a criminal offence, punishable by a fine of up to £500.  The eight zones can cover between 100m (328ft) and 250m (820ft) from entrances or exits of designated premises. The police have said preliminary figures show that since the zones came into effect on 29 September, there have been 20 incidents at the Northern Trust, resulting in 35 reports to police. The Southern Trust had 11 incidents, while the Western Trust recorded two and the Belfast Trust recorded one. No incidents have been recorded at the South Eastern Trust.  The Police Service Northern Ireland (PSNI) said their ""engage, explain and encourage"" approach to policing the new laws had been successful. Only two arrests have been made across Northern Ireland, both at Causeway Hospital, the police have said. In November, a sign comparing Causeway Hospital to a Nazi concentration camp was seized near the Lodge Road Roundabout and three people were cautioned for public order offences by police. Officers were alerted to the sign while attending a report of an alleged assault at a protest at the same time. Lauren McAuley, a member of the pro-choice group, North Coast for Choice, described the posters, placards and imagery such as white crosses, as very distressing. ""I believe that the protesters who come here are not showing any remorse or sympathy for those who may need abortion services,"" Ms McAuley said.  ""I would defend anyone's right to protest but nobody needs to protest outside a hospital. ""Where the protesters stand is on a very busy roundabout and there are schools nearby."" ""People feel harassed - you must have some understanding for what people are going through,"" Ms McAuley said. ""The 100-metre safe access zone in place is not enough. It can be extended and should be extended"". Gemma Brolly is the deputy leader of the anti-abortion party Aontú. Ms Brolly said that her party did not participate in the protests, but that she did not support the widening of the zones. ""I can't see what difference 250 metres is going to make"" she told BBC News NI.  ""I believe it can only escalate the situation further and I find it worrying and disappointing. ""We are watching the deletion of human rights where you can protest with one frame of mind but you cannot with another. ""Aontú as a party believe in respectful discourse and compassion and without that, nothing will change."" Two East Londonderry assembly members, the SDLP's Cara Hunter and Independent Claire Sugden, are supporting the extension of the zone. Cara Hunter described the imagery being used at the protests as ""shocking"". ""I have spoken to a large number of constituents, both patients and hospital staff who have told about the level of distress they have experienced as a direct result of these protests. ""There is a right to protest but for many it's traumatising seeing some of the imagery here. ""I have asked the Northern Trust for an interim report to identify concerns from constituents."" A former justice minister and Independent MLA Claire Sugden said she also supported extending the zone.  ""I appreciate people have a right to an opinion and a right to protest but it is how they are expressing themselves that is causing the issue,"" Ms Sugden said.  ""The imagery is causing distress, not just to new mothers, but to people coming in and out of the hospital. ""People have a right to protest but not when others are being harmed by it."" In a statement to BBC News NI, the Northern Trust said at Causeway Hospital, the safe access zones were set at 100m following detailed preparation work. ""We will continue to keep this under review. While we recognise and acknowledge the legitimate right to peaceful protest, we also have a duty of care to both patients and staff,"" a spokesperson said.  The Department for Health (DoH) said the safe access zones were monitored by staff and the PSNI. The department said it would produce an annual report on all eight zones' effectiveness. The anti-abortion groups, Precious Life and Abolish Abortion NI declined to comment, on any extension of the zone at Causeway Hospital.

BBCNews_56,"A law to ensure buffer zones around abortion clinics is needed ""quickly"", the health secretary has said. Neil Gray described protests from anti abortion groups outside medical facilities as ""unacceptable"". Mr Gray was speaking at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) in Glasgow, one of several sites targeted by the 40 Days for Life pro-life group. The US-based organisation have now begun a Lenten series of protests outside Scottish facilities. The health secretary, who was appointed last week, added that he hoped to see legislation passed to restrict the rights of anti abortion protestors to demonstrate around medical sites. Green Party MSP Gillian Mackay last year introduced a member's bill at the Scottish Parliament that would block any protests taking place within 200 metres of clinics. Mr Gray said that the Scottish government were ""very supportive"" of the bill. He added: ""We want to see it move through parliament as quickly as possible.  ""Of course we want to see a right to protest protected, but that cannot impede on women accessing medical services and feeling in fear of accessing those services.""   Ms Mackay said that the protests amounted to ""targeted intimidation"" of women who were getting an abortion. The MSP added that she hoped this would be the last year women would have to face the protests. And she said that the demonstrations had an ""awful impact"" both on patients and staff. The Abortion Services (Safe Access Zones) (Scotland) Bill proposes pro-life campaigners be fined if they a protest within 200 metres of medical facilities - with unlimited fines for serious breaches. Demonstrations have taking place outside the QEUH for eight years. 40 Days for Life said the protests were simply ""prayer vigils"" to end abortion and took place as the group had ""compassion and concern"" for the women attending the facilities.  Robert Colquhoun, director of campaigns, said: ""This isn't a way to target people.  ""It is important to go and pray where abortion happens because abortion doesn't happen in the parliament, it doesn't happen in the law courts, it doesn't happen in schools and universities - it happens in the local community.  ""We've seen many women change their minds who otherwise would not have changed their minds [because of the vigils].""  He added that if legislation were introduced the group would continue to protest within the law, but that other people may take action differently on an individual basis.  The group's CEO and president, Shawn Carney, said that the legislation would be ""targeted bigotry"" towards 40 Days for Life.

BBCNews_57,"A Texas judge has granted permission for an abortion to a woman whose foetus has a potentially fatal abnormality, despite the state's ban on the procedure. The ruling - which Texas may challenge - is thought to be one of the first attempts to seek a court-granted abortion.  Texas law prohibits pregnancy terminations except to save the life of the expectant mother. Abortion advocates argue the exception is too vague and puts women at risk.  That is the argument of Kate Cox, a 31-year-old mother of two from the Dallas area, who is currently 20 weeks pregnant.   Her foetus has been diagnosed with trisomy 18, a chromosomal disorder that causes abnormalities in the development of the brain, heart and other internal organs.  In almost all cases - at least 95% - the pregnancies end in miscarriage and stillbirth, according to the Cleveland Clinic. While some people can live for years with the condition, life expectancy for most is short - and those children who live past their first year may face severe intellectual challenges. According to her lawsuit, Ms Cox's physicians told her their ""hands are tied"" as long as the baby had a heartbeat, because of the state abortion ban. ""It is not a matter of if I will have to say goodbye to my baby, but when,"" Ms Cox said in a statement. ""I'm trying to do what is best for my baby and myself, but the state of Texas is making us both suffer.""  Doctors have told her continuing with the pregnancy poses a risk to her health and, potentially, her ability to carry another child, says Ms Cox. She has already had to visit the emergency room four times because of pain and discharge, her lawyers said.  ""Kate Cox needs an abortion, and she needs it now,"" her petition reads.  On Thursday, Travis County District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble granted that request, handing down a temporary restraining order allowing Ms Cox to terminate her pregnancy, and protecting her doctor from civil and criminal penalties if she performs the procedure.  ""The idea that Ms Cox wants desperately to be a parent, and this law might actually cause her to lose that ability, is shocking and would be a genuine miscarriage of justice,"" Judge Gamble, a Democrat, said.  Lawyers for the state may ask a higher court to block the order.  After the court order was issued, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sent a letter to three hospitals where Ms Cox's doctor has admitting privileges. In it, he threatened to prosecute anyone who is involved in providing an emergency abortion to Ms Cox, saying that he believes she failed to prove she qualifies for one. Mr Paxton said that Judge Gamble's order ""will not insulate hospitals, doctors, or anyone else, from civil and criminal liability for violating Texas' abortion laws"". At the hearing, Jonathan Stone, with the Texas attorney general's office, argued that Ms Cox ""does not meet all of the elements"" to qualify for a medical exception. Marc Hearron, a lawyer at the Center for Reproductive Rights, which represented Ms Fox, accused Mr Paxton of ""fearmongering"".  A ruling in Ms Cox's case could compel the state to define more clearly when abortions are allowed under the existing law.  Asked about the case later on Thursday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the Biden administration was ""glad"" Ms Cox could obtain an abortion and that ""no woman should have to go to a court to get the healthcare that she needs"".  ""We should not detract from the fact that stories like hers are becoming all too common in states where Republican elected officials are enforcing dangerous extreme bills,"" Ms Jean-Pierre said.  Ms Cox's emergency appeal comes as the Texas Supreme Court weighs another effort to clarify the state's abortion ban. That one is led by the Center for Reproductive Rights. Molly Duane, a lawyer for the organisation, told the conservative court late last month that the near-total ban had left physicians ""terrified"" to use their medical judgment over fear of harsh penalties.  Doctors who perform abortions in Texas could risk life in prison, loss of their medical licence and hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines. While there are medical exceptions to the Texas ban, ""no-one knows what it means and the state won't tell us"", Ms Duane said.  A lawyer for the attorney general, Beth Klusmann, said existing standards allowed doctors to use ""reasonable"" medical judgment. That case - Zurawski v State of Texas - could be decided by the state's highest civil court in the coming weeks.  After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade in June 2022 - effectively rescinding a nationwide right to an abortion - decisions about the procedure have been left to individual states.

BBCNews_58,"Britney Spears has said she will ""never return to the music industry"" after rumours she was planning a return to the studio surfaced last week. The pop star was responding to claims in the US media that she was lining up songwriters for a 10th studio album. ""Just so we're clear most of the news is trash!!!"" the singer wrote on Instagram. ""They keep saying I'm turning to random people to do a new album … I will never return to the music industry!!!"" Some outlets had suggested that Julia Michaels and Charlie XCX had been tapped up as collaborators. But Spears added that she only wrote music for fun and also revealed that she had written more than 20 songs for other people over the past two years. ""I'm a ghostwriter and I honestly enjoy it that way!!!"" wrote the singer, known for hits including Baby One More Time, Oops!... I Did It Again and Toxic. The post was accompanied by Guido Reni's Renaissance painting titled Salome Bearing the Head of St John the Baptist. In August 2022, Spears released her first new music since being released from a conservatorship that controlled almost every aspect of her life. Hold Me Closer - a duet with Sir Elton John - marked Spears' return to music after a six-year hiatus. Fans have been clamouring for her to return to music and although she has hinted before that she is wary of returning to the industry, this is the first time she has unequivocally ruled it out. She published her memoir last year, titled The Woman in Me, which detailed life living under a conservatorship and revealed she had had a medical abortion while dating Justin Timberlake. The artist wrote at the time: ""Pushing forward in my music career is not my focus at the moment. ""It's time for me not to be someone who other people want; it's time to actually find myself.""

BBCNews_59,"Meta says it recently removed a network of thousands of fake and misleading accounts based in China. The users posed as Americans and sought to spread polarising content about US politics and US-China relations. Among the topics the network posted about were abortion, culture war issues and aid to Ukraine. Meta did not link the profiles to Beijing officials, but it has seen an increase in such networks based in China ahead of the 2024 US elections.  China is now the third-biggest geographical source of such networks, the company said, behind Russia and Iran.  The recent takedowns were outlined in a quarterly threat report released on Thursday by the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The China-based network included more than 4,700 accounts and used profile pictures and names copied from other users around the world.  The accounts shared and liked each other's posts, and some of the content appeared to be taken directly from X, formerly Twitter.  In some cases the accounts copied and pasted verbatim posts from US politicians - both Republicans and Democrats - including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, Reps Matt Gaetz and Jim Jordan, and others. The network displayed no ideological consistency.  In examples released by Meta, an account in the China-based network reposted the words contained in a tweet earlier this year by Democrat Congresswoman Sylvia Garcia. She criticised Texas's abortion laws and wrote: ""Let's remember - abortion is healthcare."" But another account in the network copied-and-pasted a tweet from Republican Representative Ronny Jackson, who wrote: ""Taxpayer dollars should NEVER fund travel for abortions.""  Meta's report stated: ""It's unclear whether this approach was designed to amplify partisan tensions, build audiences among these politicians' supporters, or to make fake accounts sharing authentic content appear more genuine.""  The company's moderation rules forbid what Meta calls ""co-ordinated inauthentic behaviour"" - posts by groups of accounts that work together and use false identities to mislead other users.  Often the content shared by such networks is not false and references accurate news stories from major media outlets. But instead of being used for legitimate comment or debate, the posts are meant to manipulate public opinion, push division and make particular viewpoints seem more popular than they really are.  Meta said the large Chinese network was stopped before it took off among real users.  Ben Nimmo, who leads investigations into inauthentic behaviour on the company's platforms, said such networks ""still struggle to build audiences, but they're a warning"".  ""Foreign threat actors are attempting to reach people across the internet ahead of next year's elections, and we need to remain alert."" The company said it also discovered two smaller networks, one based in China and focusing on India and Tibet, and one based in Russia which posted primarily in English about the invasion of Ukraine and promoted Telegram channels. Russian networks, which prompted the company to focus on inauthentic campaigns following the 2016 election, have increasingly focused on the war in Ukraine and have attempted to undermine international support for Kyiv, the report said.  Meta also noted that the US government stopped sharing information about foreign influence networks with the company in July, after a federal ruling as part of a legal case over the First Amendment that is now under consideration by the Supreme Court.  The case is part of a larger debate about over whether the US government works with tech companies to unduly restrict the free speech of social media users.

BBCNews_60,"Donald Trump remains the overwhelming favourite for the Republican presidential nomination, but Nikki Haley is surging. If the former president shows any signs of weakness when voting begins next week, her long-shot bid could become a real threat.  On a snowy morning in Iowa this week, in the middle of an Irish pub, Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley was giving her stump speech: a tight 13 minutes on spending cuts, education reform and a secure southern border. At the heart of her pitch was this: a Haley presidency would be a return to normality, a drama-free alternative to the current frontrunner, former president Donald Trump.  ""Don't you want that again? Because we could have that again,"" she said. The line won the loudest applause of the morning from the hundred-odd voters who had braved the icy roads to hear her speak in Waukee, on the edge of the state capital Des Moines.  Eleven months into her candidacy, Ms Haley, 51, seems to finally have the wind at her back. Heading into the Iowa caucuses on Monday, the first contest in the 2024 Republican race, the former South Carolina governor has claimed a series of well-timed victories - consolidating support from deep-pocketed donors, racking up endorsements and steadily advancing in the polls.  ""She's engaging, she's smart, she's personable and I think she has a vision of where we should be 10 years from now,"" said Haley supporter Doug Stout after watching her speak on Tuesday.  The vision was for the ""shining city on the hill"" type of Republican Party, he said. ""The one I grew up with."" The unfortunate reality for the Haley campaign, however, is that not enough voters seem to be buying that vision. Most polls, including in Iowa, suggest Mr Trump maintains a lead of around 30 points.  Observers say Nikki Haley is running a campaign for the wrong era of Republican politics; that her candidacy ignores the reality of the modern Republican party, whose base has turned so definitively toward Mr Trump that the establishment-friendly conservatism favoured by Ms Haley no longer makes sense.  ""Ms Haley's campaign represents a misunderstanding of where the base is and what the base wants,"" said Gunner Ramer, political director for the Republican Accountability Project.  ""To those that want the old Republican party back, Haley is offering a very attractive candidacy. But there aren't enough Republicans out there who do.""  So what exactly is her game plan?  Ms Haley's allies say both privately and publicly that she is playing to win.  They insist that as the field narrows, and Ms Haley becomes the clear alternative to Mr Trump, she will pull ahead, propelled by moderates and a growing swathe of Republican voters who have tired of the former president, or are concerned about his chances in the general election.  In Iowa, Ms Haley looks poised to swipe the second place spot from Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. At a Wednesday evening debate between the two, Ms Haley strained to position herself as Mr Trump's sole rival. ""I wish Donald Trump was on this stage. He's the one I'm running against,"" she said.  Campaign aides told the BBC that the goal for Ms Haley in Iowa is simple: build momentum. A strong showing, they said, would carry her into New Hampshire - where polls with Mr Trump are much tighter - and then on to South Carolina, her home state.  Ms Haley may be helped by the sudden exit of anti-Trump candidate, Chris Christie, who suspended his campaign this week. Supporters of the former New Jersey Governor, surveys suggest, are most likely to flock to her.  Less helpful was Mr Christie's hot-mic moment, when he was caught saying she would ""get smoked"", presumably by Mr Trump. ""She's not up to this,"" he said.  Long-time observers counter that Ms Haley has a knack for defying expectations.  ""If you look at her career, a lot of people have underestimated her and a lot of people have been wrong,"" said Randy Covington, a veteran journalist from South Carolina.  Even her critics acknowledge that she is a master of retail politics - the door-knocking and handshaking that delivered her to the statehouse in 2005. She stunned her own party in the primary by unseating Larry Koon, then the longest-serving member of the House. At the time, Ms Haley had no political experience and was a bookkeeper for her family's clothing shop.  Nearly 20 years later, the state representative-turned-governor-turned-UN-ambassador still likes to introduce herself first as an accountant. She points out that she is a mom of two, the wife of a combat veteran and the child of Indian immigrants, running to make her family proud. In televised debates, in pancake houses and town halls, Ms Haley pauses mid-speech for a smile and pointed eye contact. She's a down-home American hard at work for your vote.  ""She connects, she has the X factor,"" said David Wilkins, a former South Carolina House speaker who led Ms Haley's transition to the governor's house. ""The more people who are exposed to her, the more support she's going to get, it's just that simple.""  Ms Haley's campaign often looks and sounds like something out of 2012: more compromise and pragmatism, fewer grievances and conspiracy theories. She is a staunch conservative, but she speaks with nuance on hot button issues like abortion and immigration, and is less eager to wade into the country's culture wars.  In Iowa this week, it was clear this was central to her appeal. Voters said they valued Ms Haley's tone and her civility - a clear departure from Mr Trump, who spent part of this week in a federal appeals court for one of the four separate criminal cases he now faces.  ""She's boring,"" one Iowan said of Ms Haley, before quickly clarifying he meant it as a compliment. ""We need to get out of the era of politics that is dominated by what someone tweeted.""  Polls suggest Ms Haley's measured approach could make her the most formidable opponent to President Joe Biden in November's general election.  ""Trump is head-to-head with Biden on a good day,"" she said this week, before citing a Wall Street Journal poll from late last year. ""I defeat Biden by 17 points.""  But she has to defeat Mr Trump first.  ""This is still the party of Donald Trump, until the Republican party says otherwise,"" said Jimmy Centers, an Iowa Republican political consultant.  At least one-third of Republican primary voters are thought to be in the ""always Trump"" camp - a group both devoted to the former president and repelled by the establishment politics embodied by Ms Haley.  ""I think she's just more of the same… and Trump isn't,"" said Mike Williams, an Iowa resident. ""I want someone who's a bit of an outsider.""  The vice-like grip Mr Trump has on the party doesn't give Ms Haley much room for manoeuvre.  She needs to appeal to two very different groups of Republicans: the ""never Trumpers"" who despise the former president, as well as those who still like him but worry he will lose to Biden. She has to distance herself from him without alienating his supporters who might yet be persuaded to back someone else. Ms Haley has been cautious in her criticism of her old boss. At a televised town hall in Iowa, a prospective backer sheepishly admitted he had voted for Mr Trump twice. ""Me too,"" she quipped, beaming.  In nearly every speech, she performs a tightly rehearsed juggling act. Mr Trump ""was the ""right president at the right time"", she'll say. ""But rightly or wrongly, chaos follows him"". Those close to Ms Haley shot down the suggestion that she may eventually join his ticket as the vice-presidential nominee - something the Trump campaign has also dismissed. But Ms Haley has said yes to him before, when she became his ambassador at the United Nations.  Mr Trump, for his part, has turned his ire increasingly on Ms Haley, whom he dubbed ""birdbrain"" in September. ""She is a globalist,"" he said last week. ""She likes the globe. I like America first."" The escalating critiques are perhaps the clearest sign that the frontrunner is taking her campaign seriously. Some Trump aides have also been downplaying expectations of a blowout victory in Iowa. The Republican race will not be decided this month. But the upcoming votes in Iowa and New Hampshire will be the first test of whether Mr Trump's power is as strong as it seems. If not, Ms Haley will be waiting in the wings.  The man who burned himself in Washington DC is an active-duty US airman, local media report. After Alabama rules that frozen embryos are children, some fertility patients pray that lawmakers find a solution. The former president moves closer to the Republican nomination with a huge win in his rival's home state. Trump celebrated ""Republican unity"" after winning the South Carolina primary - but his rival is staying in the race. The US says the allies targeted 18 sites, including missile storages, drones and radars. Copyright 2024 BBC.

BBCNews_61,"A Salvadoran woman has been freed from prison more than seven years after she was convicted for having an abortion. The 28-year-old, identified only as Lilian, was sentenced to 30 years in prison in 2015. She gave birth to a girl in a public hospital in 2015, but the baby suffered health complications and died there three days later.  There is a total ban on abortion in El Salvador, which has one of the world's strictest anti-abortion laws. Prosecutors had accused Lilian of not taking care of the foetus during her pregnancy, and she was charged with negligence and aggravated murder. Lilian, who has a 10-year-old daughter, has always maintained her innocence, and said she never intended to terminate her pregnancy. ""In the name of all my companions, I ask you to stop accusing and prosecuting other innocent women like me,"" she said in a news conference on Wednesday.  ""It was a very hard trauma to live through and I don't wish it on anyone."" Campaign groups who supported Lilian during her ordeal said she was freed in December, but the information has only now been made public. They said the judge's decision to release Lilian was based on the fact that she was in a vulnerable situation in hospital when she lost her baby.  El Salvador's total ban on abortions was introduced in 1998. It does not include exemptions in cases of rape or when the pregnancy poses a health risk for the mother. Those found guilty of terminating their pregnancy face between two and eight years in prison. But in many cases the charge is changed to aggravated homicide, which carries a minimum sentence of 30 years. Dozens of women are believed to have been wrongly imprisoned in El Salvador under suspicion of having had an abortion. Following campaigns by rights groups, a number of women who were convicted have been released in recent years. But some still remain in prison and are serving decades-long sentences. ""We insist that we are asking for justice, so women have access to our sexual and reproductive rights,"" Mariana Moisa, from civil rights group Nos Faltan Las 17 (We Miss The 17), said at Wednesday's news conference. President Nayib Bukele, who is widely expected to be re-elected next month, says he intends to improve conditions in hospitals to make childbirth safer. But he has stressed that he has no intention of changing El Salvador's current abortion law. Most of the country's population is either Roman Catholic or Evangelical, who say that life begins at conception and must be protected at all costs. The victims were killed in separate, unrelated incidents in the Austrian capital on Friday. Women take part despite some in the community suggesting it should remain a men-only event. Parents in England wanting 15 hours free childcare for two-year-olds face an important deadline. Democrats have already seized on the issue, which could complicate Republican plans to win back suburban women. The president - who calls himself the world's coolest dictator - wants them to take on ""elites"". Copyright 2024 BBC.

BBCNews_62,"An unprecedented number of women are being investigated by police on suspicion of illegally ending a pregnancy, the BBC has been told.  Abortion provider MSI says it knows of up to 60 criminal inquiries in England and Wales since 2018, compared with almost zero before. Some investigations followed natural pregnancy loss, File on 4 found.  Pregnancy loss is investigated only if credible evidence suggests a crime, the National Police Chiefs' Council says. File on 4 has spoken to women who say that they have been ""traumatised"" and left feeling ""suicidal"" following criminal investigations lasting years. Speaking for the first time, one woman described how she had been placed under investigation after giving birth prematurely, despite maintaining that she had never attempted an abortion.  In England, Scotland and Wales, abortion is legal up to 24 weeks with the approval of two doctors. However, after 10 weeks the procedure must be carried out in an approved clinic or NHS hospital.  Abortions after 24 weeks are allowed only if the woman's life is in danger, if there is a severe fetal abnormality or if the woman is at risk of grave physical and mental injury. Outside of these circumstances, deliberately ending a pregnancy remains a criminal offence in England and Wales under the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act, which carries a maximum punishment of life in prison.  Dr Jonathan Lord, medical director at MSI, which is one of the UK's main abortion providers, believes the ""unprecedented"" number of women now falling under investigation may be linked to the police's increased awareness of the availability of the ""pills by post"" scheme - introduced in England and Wales during the Covid-19 lockdown. Scotland also introduced a similar programme. These ""telemedicine"" schemes, which allow pregnancies up to 10 weeks to be terminated at home, remain in effect. Campaigners are concerned that it is possible for women to knowingly or unknowingly use the pills after this point. The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), the UK's other main abortion provider, says it has received more than two dozen police requests for the medical records of women who have enquired about an abortion.  In March, MPs are due to vote on an amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill that would have the effect of protecting women from prosecution for having an abortion. File on 4 spoke to Katie (not her real name), who has been under investigation for several years for illegally procuring an abortion.  She says she believed that she was approximately seven weeks pregnant when she contacted a provider and received abortion pills through the post. After taking the pills at home, Katie says she went into labour and gave birth to a stillborn baby. She later realised the pregnancy had progressed beyond the 24-week limit. ""After I gave birth I just froze - nothing will ever prepare you for something like that,"" she says.  ""I didn't know what to do. I just kept thinking: 'How did this happen? How did I not know?'"" Katie was taken to hospital, where staff called the police. She was arrested on suspicion of self-inducing an abortion illegally and held in police custody before she was released on bail. MSI's Dr Lord says criminal investigations and prosecutions further ""traumatise"" women after abortions, and that women like Katie deserve ""compassion"" rather than ""punishment"".  ""These women are often vulnerable and in desperate situations - they need help, not investigation and punishment,"" he says.  When abortion is a crime Divya Talwar speaks to women who have been investigated by police on suspicion of illegally ending a pregnancy. Listen on BBC Sounds Katie could face a prison sentence. She maintains that she had no idea that she was over the legal time limit when she took the pills - she says she was still having regular periods and had not put on any weight.  ""Being under investigation, it's such a long process and months go past without you hearing anything,"" she says. ""I have genuinely felt suicidal at times because of it.""  Melanie McDonagh, a journalist who has written widely about abortion and believes abortion should not be fully decriminalised, says the rise in police investigations is a consequence of ""pills by post"" and called for in-person consultations to be reintroduced at clinics. ""If we return to the situation before telemedicine in 2020, then there would be a guard against most of these cases happening in the first place,"" she says. Abortion providers say the 1861 law that makes abortion a criminal offence is no longer fit for purpose - and the increase in cases being investigated means they want abortion to be fully decriminalised. In Scotland, abortion is criminalised under common law. Abortion was fully decriminalised in Northern Ireland in 2020. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) says prosecutions under the law are rare: ""We carefully consider the personal circumstances of those who end their pregnancy outside the legal parameters and address these as sensitively as possible. ""Our prosecutors have a duty to ensure that laws set by Parliament are properly considered and applied when making difficult charging decisions."" Only four women have gone on to be convicted of procuring an illegal abortion in the past 20 years. One of these women, Carla Foster, was jailed in June last year.  Another woman, Bethany Cox, was cleared of the same charge in January. Since December 2022, four more women in England have appeared in court under the law. Charges were dropped against one and discontinued in another case, while two women face a potential trial.  In some cases, women have been reported to police on suspicion of having an illegal abortion by healthcare workers, including midwives.  The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) issued new guidance to medical professionals in January, urging them not to report women to police if they suspected they may have illegally ended their pregnancies. RCOG said it was concerned that ""traumatised"" women were being prosecuted after abortions.  But abortion providers MSI and BPAS say this does not go far enough, because women can still be subject to criminal investigation if they are reported by someone else.  However, Melanie McDonagh says health professionals should not be discouraged from contacting police and that they have a ""responsibility"" to both the woman and the foetus.   MPs are set to vote on the amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill that would decriminalise abortion next month. It will become law if approved by both the House of Commons and the Lords,   Those who coerce women into abortions against their will would not be protected from prosecution if it passes. Labour MP Diana Johnson, who tabled the amendment, says it would bring England and Wales into line with Northern Ireland. But opponents of the proposed law change say it sets a dangerous precedent.  Melanie McDonagh says changing the law would be ""disastrous"".  She says: ""If abortion was decriminalised, we would have more cases of women having abortions beyond the legal limit. ""We should be doing everything in our power to discourage this, and the law acts as a deterrent.""  File on 4 has also found evidence of women falling under suspicion of illegally ending a pregnancy following a natural pregnancy loss - rather than taking pills - or premature birth.  Sammy, who lives with her husband and teenage son in the north of England, says she decided to have an abortion after falling pregnant last year.  But staff at the abortion clinic told Sammy she was over the legal 24-week time limit. ""I was all over the place, I searched for information about adoption and abortion,"" she says. Even though abortion pills would not have been medically safe or legal to take, she says she did at one point put abortion tablets in her online basket and researched information about abortion methods as well as adoption. She says, though, that she did not go through with the purchase of the tablets, deciding instead to come to terms with continuing the pregnancy.  But six days later, she says she started to feel unwell and realised she was going into premature labour.  Her son was born at home over three months premature, weighing only 1lb 5oz (700g). ""He was blue in colour, he wasn't breathing, so I had to start CPR on him,"" she says.  While she previously had wanted a termination, ""that didn't mean I didn't want him to survive"" after he was born, she says - and he did survive.  Sammy's husband called 999 and police and paramedics arrived. After Sammy was taken to hospital, her husband was arrested on suspicion of procuring an illegal abortion. She was told she needed to be interviewed at the police station.  ""We were treated like criminals from the get-go, but we'd done nothing wrong,"" she says.  Sammy's husband was released on bail, but they both remained under police investigation for over a year.   Last month, Sammy was told police were dropping the investigation because of a lack of evidence.  Dr Lord said that in another case, a teenager was investigated by hospital staff after a pregnancy loss because she had previously contacted an abortion provider.  He said: ""This is a national scandal, which I think we will look back on in years to come and think, how was this allowed to happen?""   The police force that handled Sammy's case said officers who arrived at her house had identified information to suggest that a crime may have been committed and a ""thorough"" investigation was required. It said no-one involved would face any further police action.  Sammy says although she is relieved, she is still dealing with the impact of the investigation on her mental health.  ""I still don't sleep properly because I'm still constantly worrying about being taken away,"" she says.  ""I think without the support of my family, I wouldn't still be here.""  The victims were killed in separate, unrelated incidents in the Austrian capital on Friday. The investigation has received more than 1,000 personal accounts, with cases dating back to the 1960s. Women take part despite some in the community suggesting it should remain a men-only event. Fathers in Northern Ireland open up about seeking mental health help after the births of their babies. Parents in England wanting 15 hours free childcare for two-year-olds face an important deadline. Copyright 2024 BBC.

BBCNews_63,"South Korea has suspended parts of its 2018 agreement with the North aimed at lowering military tensions. This comes after Pyongyang claimed to have successfully launched a spy satellite into space. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo said the launch threatened South Korea's security. Seoul said it would resume surveillance flights along its border with North Korea, breaching a no-fly zone established under the military pact.  Some analysts have said these developments could escalate tensions further. Pyongyang fired a rocket, said to contain its Malligyong-1 spy satellite, late on Tuesday and hailed the launch as a ""success"". On Wednesday, South Korea's military confirmed that the satellite had entered orbit but noted that it was too soon to tell if it was actually functioning, though both it and the US strongly condemned the launch.  US National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said the move risked ""destabilising the security situation in the region and beyond."" Developing a functioning spy satellite is a major part of North Korea's five-year military plan, set out by its leader Kim Jong Un in January 2021. The technology could in theory enable Pyongyang to monitor the movement of US and South Korean troops and weapons on the Korean Peninsula, allowing it to spot incoming threats. It would also allow the North to plot its nuclear attacks with more precision. North Korea's space agency, the National Aerospace Technology Administration, said the launch was an attempt to bolster the country's self-defence capabilities, in the face of ""dangerous military moves"" by its enemies. Pyongyang added that it planned to launch several more spy satellites ""in a short space of time"".  Some analysts are sceptical as to whether the satellite is advanced enough to be effective. Jang Young-geun, who runs the Missile Centre at the Korea Research Institute for National Strategy, predicted that given past attempts, the resolution of the satellite's camera is ""probably not at a level to allow for detailed military reconnaissance."" Nonetheless, he said, a low resolution is ""better than nothing"", as an attack - regardless of the target - will need information to make it more effective.  Ankit Panda, a nuclear policy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, also reckoned that while the satellite could enhance the effectiveness of North Korea's armed forces, it could conversely have a ""stabilising effect"" on the Peninsula. ""It could make Pyongyang act less skittishly in crises,"" he said. ""For instance, it could use its satellites to verify that the US and South Korea were, in fact, not surging their forces to prepare for a major attack.""  This is the North's third attempt this year to put a spy satellite into orbit, after two previous attempts in May and August failed. South Korean officials said they believed Pyongyang had received technical support from Moscow, which allowed it to overcome the hurdles that had led to its previous failures. When Kim Jong Un met Vladimir Putin at the Vostochny space centre in Russia's far east in September, the Russian leader hinted he would help Mr Kim build satellites. The US and South Korea believe the North is sending Russia arms to use in Ukraine, and that Moscow may have agreed to share its military expertise in return. But Mr Panda said there was no evidence that Pyongyang had received Russia's technical assistance and implemented it. ""This was North Korea's third launch attempt and they've been carrying out their own research and development on space systems for a while now,"" Mr Panda noted. Jo Bee Yun, an associate research fellow at the Korea Institute for Defence Analysis (KIDA), added that the time was too limited for Russia to have provided ""game-changing"" technology, but that ""significant transfers"" could be expected in the future. Mr Kim and then South Korean President Moon Jae-in signed the Comprehensive Military Agreement in 2018, in an attempt to de-escalate tensions between their two countries and prevent a conflict erupting. It limited military movements by both sides near the border, removed guard posts, banned live-fire drills, and created a no fly-zone. But the South Korean government had recently argued that the deal left it vulnerable to an attack, by prohibiting it from flying surveillance aircraft and reconnaissance drones along the border. Members of South Korea's National Security Council met in the early hours of Wednesday morning, followed by its defence chiefs and cabinet. All agreed the country should restart surveillance operations along the border with immediate effect and with the president's backing. This increased surveillance will allow the South to monitor North Korean outposts and long-range artillery, previously hidden behind its mountain slopes. Seoul currently relies on US spy satellites to monitor the North, but is planning to launch its first home-built model into space at the end of November. Some analysts warn that the suspension of the military pact could escalate tensions and make cross-border skirmishes more likely. Hong Min, from the Korea Institute for National Unification, pointed out that the deal had significantly reduced the number of cross-border incidents and had been successful in deterring the North. He said Seoul risked providing it with ""the justification to carry out further provocations."" However Jo Bee Yun of KIDA, does not believe the suspension would increase tensions, noting that Pyongyang has been regularly launching missiles since 2022. ""The cycle of provocations has already resumed. South Korea had to respond sometime or another."" South Korea captain Son Heung-min asks fans to forgive Lee Kang-in after his team-mate apologises for his involvement in an altercation between the pair at the Asian Cup. The Kremlin says it was an Aurus, a full-sized sedan of the type used by the Russian president himself. Medical interns and residents have resigned or gone on strike over a recruitment proposal. The Chinese man faces US extradition for his alleged role in an illegal trade that enriched Pyongyang.

BBCNews_64,"The Republican primary race is not officially over but with no obvious pathway to victory for Nikki Haley, a general election showdown between two adversaries is coming into view. We are months away from the Democratic and Republican conventions, the moment when each party officially unveils its presidential nominee. But the 2024 election seems all but set in stone.  The contest between Joe Biden and Donald Trump will be unique in modern history as a rematch between the current president and his immediate predecessor. ""Having two presidents running changes the nature of the race,"" says Todd Belt, a politics professor at George Washington University.  ""This is a comparison, not just a referendum on the incumbent. There are no blank slates going into this election."" The contrast will be simple, according to Sean Spicer, who served as Mr Trump's first press secretary and worked for the Republican National Committee prior to that. ""For those people who say, well, during Trump, the policies of Donald Trump made my life better, more secure, made the economy and our communities better, it's a no brainer."" The Trump campaign has every motivation to go on the attack against Mr Biden, in part to distract from his own weaknesses - including his legal troubles, his divisive rhetoric and his attempts to undermine the 2020 election results, which contributed to the January 2021 attack on the US Capitol. But Mr Biden also has key vulnerabilities, struggling to sell his first-term achievements and trying to convince the public he has the energy for the campaign and a second term.  Already in this presidential race he is painting his predecessor as out-of-control and a threat to America, and to democracy itself. ""Usually, that's what you do when you're running against somebody who's unknown in politics,"" says Susan Estrich, a Democratic author and analyst who managed Michael Dukakis' presidential campaign in 1988. ""But here, you've got somebody who's very well known, and you're just trying to prove he's a big risk."" It's a rematch few Americans say they want - a bare-knuckle, nasty slog of a campaign - but it's a presidential choice that at this point they seem almost certain to get. Mr Biden's approval ratings continue to languish in dangerous territory for an incumbent entering an election year. Public perceptions of Mr Trump are also negative, however. By all indications, November's general election is going to be tight. National polls show the two candidates either neck and neck or Mr Trump with a slight advantage. But this early in the race they are of limited usefulness, given the nature of the US political map. While Americans will head to the polls across the nation, this race will once again be decided in only a handful of states. That's because the electoral college, the system the US has to pick its president, depends on candidates winning each state and most states are solidly Democratic or Republican. The most crucial states that could go either way this year include Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan in the so-called Rust Belt, and Arizona and Georgia, two states that Mr Biden flipped Democratic in 2020. Nevada is also considered a toss-up but its small population makes it a less valuable prize. A few states that have been battlegrounds in previous election cycles have slipped off this map - Florida and North Carolina have trended Republican of late, while Virginia and Colorado appear to be more solidly Democratic. So while national polls provide fodder for political commentators, a much smaller subset of voters will ultimately be the ones who matter. Polling in November that showed Mr Trump inching ahead in these key states caused alarm among some Democrats, but polls a year from the election are not necessarily accurate predictors of the outcome.  When it comes down to it, Americans tend to vote from their wallets in national elections - for the governing party in good times and the opposition in bad. ""It's the economy, stupid"" was the mantra of Bill Clinton's successful 1992 presidential campaign, and the refrain has become political gospel in the decades since. One of the factors that makes 2024 challenging to predict is that, on the whole, economic indicators are positive.  If you're in the UK, sign up here. And if you're anywhere else, sign up here. The economy is growing at a steady clip. Unemployment is near record lows. The stock market is hitting record highs. And yet American voters continue to have a grim view of their economic situation. Some of this can be attributed to several years of high inflation and the continuing high cost of housing in many parts of the US. Home sales in the US have sunk to the lowest levels in nearly 30 years. At the Trump victory party in Iowa, two large video screens cycled through graphics showing how rising home mortgage interest rates during the Biden administration have driven up monthly home payments. There are some recent signs of hope for Mr Biden, however.  Consumer confidence, as measured by a University of Michigan survey, has reached its highest level since July 2021. Inflation and gas prices have fallen. There is still plenty of time for voters to change their minds about the state of the American economy. Mr Trump will argue that things were better when he was in office.  According to Mr Spicer, the economy - like crime - is a ""gut"" issue and many Americans still don't believe their everyday situation has improved. ""Until you viscerally feel it,"" he says, ""it doesn't matter what statistic gets thrown at you."" Mr Biden will counter that the US weathered the post-Covid economic storm better than almost any other country in the world and that Bidenomics - his blend of infrastructure investment, tax cuts and social spending - has improved the lot of working Americans. The Biden campaign will try to convince voters that Mr Trump is responsible for abortion becoming illegal or greatly curtailed in dozens of states, even as the former president has tried to moderate his position on the issue. Ever since the US Supreme Court, with the help of three Trump-appointed justices, discarded a 50-year precedent giving the right to abortion constitutional protections, Democrats have been riding a groundswell of support on the issue to post better-than-expected results at the ballot box. Mr Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris recently held a campaign event in Northern Virginia focused narrowly on this one issue. ""Abortion has turned out to be a much more powerful issue than a lot of people thought it would be,"" Ms Estrich says. ""Everywhere it's been on the ballot, the pro-choice position has won."" If abortion is the electoral issue the Democrats will be trying to elevate in the minds of voters, Mr Trump and the conservatives will be doing the same for immigration.  Border crossings reached an all-time high in December with 249,785 arrests on the Mexican border - up 31% from November and up 13% from December 2022, the previous record. This massive influx of undocumented migrants and asylum-seekers has at times overwhelmed government processing facilities and strained social service programmes in major cities thousands of miles away. Polls show that immigration is the top issue for much of Mr Trump's base - and a source of weakness for the president and division among Democrats.  Efforts to address the problem in Congress have proven unsuccessful, in no small part because Mr Trump has been pressuring Republicans to block compromise legislation until after the election. ""The Biden administration has lost the argument on safety and security at our southern border,"" says Mr Spicer. ""It's over."" Other issues might also play a factor in the upcoming presidential race, including US crime rates, the environment and climate change, and foreign policy.  The Gaza War, in particular, might be an ongoing headache for Mr Biden, as the administration's support for Israel has angered some Democrats, including a larger percentage of the young voters whose turnout in November could decide the election. The longest general election campaign in recent memory leaves plenty of time for the unpredictable to occur. Given the advanced age of both Mr Biden (81) and Mr Trump (77), an incident that calls into question their health and fitness could happen any time.  In the autumn presidential debates, their energy and composure under pressure will be particularly scrutinised. ""Age is hurting Biden right now. Everybody thinks Biden is old,"" say Ms Estrich. ""The question is, will Trump show the signs of his age?"" Given that polls indicate a majority of Americans are dissatisfied with their two major-party options, the environment is ripe for a third-party or independent candidate to emerge.  Robert Kennedy Jr, the anti-vaccine activist, is already running, although he is only on the ballot in one state so far. The No Labels group, which has the backing of some deep-pocketed donors, may field its own candidate. Mr Trump's legal headaches could also factor into the race - he faces 91 charges and four criminal trials. Although the indictments seem to have buoyed his standing among Republicans, a criminal conviction may be a different matter. According to an exit poll of voters in the recently concluded New Hampshire Republican primary, 42% said Mr Trump would not be fit for office if he were found guilty. The timing of the former president's trials - some of which have been tentatively scheduled for March and April - is still in flux. The spectacle of Mr Trump in the defendant's dock, and a detailed litigation of his alleged crimes, could also affect public opinion in a way that the indictments have not. The January 2021 attack on the US Capitol by his supporters, with Mr Trump accused of egging them on, has left a scar on the American psyche.  While Republican voters appear willing to move past it, Democrats - and, perhaps, the kind of independent voters who will help decide this election - still remember. The more they are reminded of that trauma, and the way the first Trump presidency ended - whether by Mr Biden and the Democrats or through courtroom drama - the more the former president's past actions may ultimate come back to haunt him. The man who burned himself in Washington DC is an active-duty US airman, local media report. After Alabama rules that frozen embryos are children, some fertility patients pray that lawmakers find a solution. The former president moves closer to the Republican nomination with a huge win in his rival's home state. Trump celebrated ""Republican unity"" after winning the South Carolina primary - but his rival is staying in the race. The US says the allies targeted 18 sites, including missile storages, drones and radars. Copyright 2024 BBC.

BBCNews_65,"""Good in every way, except he's not a woman."" This was the ambivalent reaction of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor to the nomination of her successor to the US Supreme Court. Such sentiments were typical of O'Connor, the first female justice to sit on the nation's top court. The expectations of O'Connor's historic appointment in 1981 weighed heavily on her shoulders throughout her 26-year term. A self-professed ""cowgirl from the Arizona desert"", the conservative justice had to constantly prove she was better than men and on the side of women. O'Connor did so with guile, drawing on her political acumen as a Republican activist and state senator to navigate the choppy waters of Supreme Court decisions. Ideologically, O'Connor was a moderate, a position that often gave her the decisive swing vote in a court sharply divided between conservative and liberal justices. For much of the 1980s and beyond, O'Connor cast consequential votes on an array of contentious issues, from abortion rights to the disputed presidential election of 2000. As a standard bearer for gender equality, O'Connor was succeeded by the second female justice to sit on the Supreme Court, the ""notorious"" Ruth Bader Ginsburg. O'Connor never had a nickname that stuck, nor a politically charged cult following. Instead, O'Connor made her mark in a way that few justices can. She held the balance of power on the court for almost two decades, making her one of the most powerful women in the country, notorious in all but name. ""Justice O'Connor was the queen of the court, for a long time,"" one of her biographers Linda Hirshman told the BBC. Independent, hard-working and self-sufficient, O'Connor owed many of her defining character traits to her isolated and at times austere upbringing in the country's south-west, where she was born in El Paso, Texas in 1930. Lazy B, a 198,000-acre cattle ranch in the desert straddling Arizona and New Mexico, was the place she called home. There, in a simple farm house 14km (nine miles) from the nearest paved road, O'Connor was raised by her mum, Ada Mae Day, and dad, Harry Alfred Day. It was a rugged childhood, shaped by the ups and downs of the family business and the trappings of ranch life. Learning to ride a horse, drive a truck and shoot a .22-calibre rifle with her dad were as much a part of her early education as reading books with her mum. For her formal education, though, O'Connor was sent to live with her grandmother in El Paso. At 16, she enrolled at Stanford University to pursue the unfulfilled dream of her father, who had yearned to study there before committing to the family ranch. Her time at Stanford was fruitful, both academically and romantically, earning her two degrees (in economics and law) and the affections of several suitors. One biographer, Evan Thomas, reckons she received four marriage proposals at Stanford. One of them, according to Mr Thomas, came from future Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist. The proposal was rejected. Then entered fellow Stanford law student John Jay O'Connor, who she married in 1952. On paper, their CVs were evenly matched, both editors of the prestigious Stanford Law Review. In reality, there was a yawning gender gap between them. ""No-one gave me a job,"" O'Connor told the International Bar Association in 2011. ""It was very frustrating because I had done very well in both undergraduate and law school and my male classmates weren't having any problems."" In her first job, she agreed to work for nothing, with no office, for a county attorney in San Mateo, California. Such conditions would be risible by today's standards, but O'Connor persisted and was eventually able to muster a small salary. A US army draft took O'Connor and her husband to Germany and, upon their return in 1957, they decided to settle in Maricopa County, Arizona. Even then, sexism impeded O'Connor's desired career path. ""Law firms wouldn't hire women lawyers,"" O'Connor said at the Aspen Ideas Festival in 2011. ""So I had to figure out some way to practise law."" She did find a way, setting up her own walk-in legal practice at a shopping centre, where she took on petty cases. It gave her skin in the game, but she soon decided her priorities lay elsewhere: at home with her three sons, Scott, Brian and Jay. From the birth of her second son Brian in 1960, O'Connor took a five-year break from the legal profession. This period is often framed as O'Connor's ""career hiatus"", but Scott said it was nothing of the sort. ""She had more energy than 20 people,"" Scott told the BBC. ""She wasn't just sitting there in her slippers watching soap operas at home."" On top of parenting, O'Connor had various side-hustles to keep her busy. She delved into politics for the Maricopa County Young Republicans, public health for Arizona State Hospital and charity for the Salvation Army. This flurry of volunteer activity raised O'Connor's profile and expanded her connections on the political scene in Arizona. Thereafter, doors started to open.  In 1965, she landed a job as an assistant attorney general for Arizona. In that role, she earned the good graces of Arizona Governor Jack Williams, who appointed her to a vacancy in the state senate. She won re-election twice, which, to her three boys, was ""no big deal"" at the time. ""My brothers and I figured that our mum has a different job to the other mums,"" Scott said. ""But we didn't realise how unusual that was back in those days."" On one occasion, O'Connor convinced her fellow senators to pause a legislative session so she could make cookies and lemonade for her sons. Clearly, O'Connor commanded respect. This clout, underpinned by her hobnobbing and won't-take-no-for-an-answer attitude, helped her break down the gender barriers in her path. Her first glass-ceiling breach came in 1973, when she was elected majority leader of Arizona's Senate. It was a landmark first for a woman in the US. A year later, she switched gears from politics to law, winning election as a county judge in 1975 before her appointment to the Arizona Court of Appeals in 1979. Her rise was timely. Running for president in 1980, Ronald Reagan pledged to appoint the first woman to the Supreme Court. So when Reagan won the election, O'Connor, the ranch girl cum lawyer cum politician cum judge, was well placed to fill the next vacancy on the court. O'Connor had supporters in high places, not least her old flame Justice Rehnquist, who pressed for her selection behind the scenes. A 15-minute interview with O'Connor at the White House was all it took for President Reagan to make up his mind. Charmed by her south-western disposition and impressed by her sharp intellect, Reagan named O'Connor - a ""woman for all seasons"" - his nominee in 1981. Scott said his mum's nomination ""was like being struck by lightning"".  ""It was hard to believe,"" he said. His mum was taken aback too. ""I had never been a law clerk there, I had never tried a case at court,"" O'Connor told the International Bar Association. Given the outcome of her Senate hearings - the first to be broadcast live on TV - she needn't have worried. Her nomination was largely well received by liberals and conservatives alike. The emphatic result of her confirmation vote, 99-0, reflected this. O'Connor represented ""a kind of bipartisan consensus about the American experiment and how we should govern ourselves"", Hirshman, author of Sisters in Law, said.  ""She came from Arizona, where… there was a lot of old-fashioned American consensus. Her confirmation hearings were a love fest."" With O'Connor's nomination confirmed, ""the brethren"" lost their 191-year monopoly on the Supreme Court. A new dawn had broken. As a symbol of progress for women, O'Connor made her presence felt. When it came to the law, however, O'Connor did not bring her ideology to bear on the court. In fact, those who worked with her question whether she had an ideology at all. ""She was one of a set of justices who was pragmatic,"" Eugene Volokh, a legal scholar who clerked for Day O'Connor in 1993, told the BBC. ""Her view was: you want the legal system to work effectively, and you want to interpret statutes and constitutional provisions with an eye towards that. The result, in some situations, was that she wasn't very predictable."" Her son Scott saw her as an ""incrementalist"" who ""wasn't trying to knock down tradition too much"". In general, O'Connor refrained from making sweeping judgments and was mindful of the rights of individuals and states. In her early years on the court, O'Connor was a core member of the conservative bloc. Only when the court shifted rightwards, following the appointments of conservative justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, David Souter and Clarence Thomas, did O'Connor start to break ranks more frequently. She had a tendency to side with liberal justices on matters of equality and civil rights. Yet, the record shows she still sat with the conservative bloc more than the liberal one in contentious 5-4 decisions. One notable schism between O'Connor and the conservatives came in 1992 with Planned Parenthood v Casey, a controversial case about abortion rights. O'Connor joined a 5-4 majority in affirming Roe v Wade, the 1973 decision that decriminalised abortion in the US. The vote confounded critics of O'Connor, who had previously expressed her personal abhorrence of abortion. But while Roe v Wade was saved, a new test was applied to the restriction of abortions at state level. States were given more latitude to impose regulations unless they ""unduly burdened"" women seeking abortion. ""Many people in the abortion rights movement believe we would have been better off if they had outright overruled Roe v Wade,"" Hirshman said. ""We could have had a referendum on whether Americans really wanted to go back to women getting back-alley abortions."" In 2022, her eventual replacement - hardcore conservative Justice Samuel Alito - authored the majority opinion that finally overturned Roe v Wade.  O'Connor's most contentious decision of all, perhaps, was that of Bush v Gore in 2000. That year, Republican George W Bush and Democrat Al Gore fought a closely contested election for the presidency. The result was so close in Florida, state law required a recount. Legal battles over the recount ensued, leading to a controversial decision by the Supreme Court.  O'Connor voted with the 5-4 majority to halt any legal challenges to the results of the election, effectively putting Bush in the White House. The decision was seen as a Republican stitch up because O'Connor was reported to have been upset at the prospect of a Gore win on election night. She denied this, but Democrats were incensed, accusing O'Connor of political bias. Her legacy, Hirshman said, will forever be tainted by that ruling. It was one that came back to haunt O'Connor following her retirement from the court in 2006. Bush locked in a conservative-leaning court, which ultimately dismantled some of her biggest compromise achievements on abortion rights and campaign finance. This bitterly disappointed O'Connor but, as she said in 2011, ""life goes on"". And so it did for O'Connor. At 75, she took a relatively early retirement for a Supreme Court justice. She did so to care for her husband, who died in 2009 after living with Alzheimer's disease for many years. O'Connor was devastated, but later told biographer Mr Thomas that retiring from the court was ""the biggest mistake, the dumbest thing I ever did"". Nevertheless, O'Connor threw herself into a ""second career"". ""After leaving the court, in her 80s, she took on a project to educate young Americans about civics,"" Scott said. One initiative, iCivics, uses gaming technology to teach six million students a year about how the US government works. ""All Supreme Court justices now talk about the importance of civics. It was mum who got that going,"" Scott said. O'Connor remained active in public life well into her 80s, until she finally encountered an obstacle she couldn't overcome. ""Some time ago, doctors diagnosed me with the beginning stages of dementia, probably Alzheimer's disease,"" O'Connor announced in 2018. ""While the final chapter of my life with dementia may be trying, nothing has diminished my gratitude and deep appreciation for the countless blessings in my life. ""As a young cowgirl from the Arizona desert, I never could have imagined that one day I would become the first woman justice on the US Supreme Court."" History remembers firsts, regardless of their legacy. O'Connor left a legacy that transcends her first, not least in the progression of gender equality, constitutional law and civic education. Simple intentions, her brother said, were at the root of it all. ""She didn't do it for legacy, she didn't do it for heroism,"" Alan Day told The Arizona Republic newspaper. ""She was who she was because she wanted to be a good person and do good things."" Indeed, at her confirmation hearings in 1981, O'Connor was asked what kind of legacy she'd like to leave. ""Ah, the tombstone question,"" she said. ""I hope it says, 'Here lies a good judge.'"" The man who burned himself in Washington DC is an active-duty US airman, local media report.

BBCNews_66,"The Democratic and Republican governors of two of the most populous US states exchanged insults for more than an hour on primetime television. Fox News host Sean Hannity moderated the so-called Great Red vs Blue State Debate between Florida's Ron DeSantis and California's Gavin Newsom. The event featured arguments about abortion, crime, the US economy and the 2024 presidential election.  Unlike Mr DeSantis, Mr Newsom is not running in the election.  But the California governor claimed last night it was only a matter of time before Mr DeSantis would be forced to concede.  ""We have one thing in common: Neither of us will be the nominee for our party in 2024,"" Mr Newsom said.  Over the course of the night, Mr Newsom lobbed several jabs at Mr DeSantis over Mr Trump's 2024 polling lead. The Florida governor was widely viewed as a rival candidate to Mr Trump, but has seen his favourability drop in recent months.  Mr Newsom also proved a fierce defender of Mr Biden, frequently touting his policy successes such as US economic growth and falling inflation numbers.  His support for Mr Biden became a line of attack for Mr DeSantis.  ""He's joined at the hip with Biden and [Vice President Kamala] Harris,"" Mr DeSantis said.  The Florida governor also attacked Mr Newsom over several of his policies, including Covid-19 quarantine restrictions and his handling of crime in the state.  It proved to be a more spirited performance for Mr DeSantis than previous Republican presidential debates, where he has struggled to stand out.   As the two leaders continued to yell over each other, Mr Hannity pleaded with them to spend more time directly responding to his questions.  ""It'd be great if both of you guys cooperated. I'm not a potted plant here,"" he said.  The former president moves closer to the Republican nomination with a huge win in his rival's home state.

BBCNews_67,"The Polish parliament has given former Prime Minister Donald Tusk a mandate to form a new coalition government. The incoming administration will be sworn in at the presidential palace by President Andrzej Duda on Wednesday. It will put an end to the eight-year rule of the right-wing nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party, which repeatedly clashed with EU authorities. However, Mr Tusk may face difficulties in meeting his promise to undo the effects of PiS rule. Mr Tusk's centrist coalition won most seats in October's elections but had been unable to take office until now. The PiS, led by Mateusz Morawiecki, emerged as the single biggest party after the election, but other parties refused to work alongside it and it was not able to form a majority in parliament. Mr Morawiecki lost a vote of confidence on Monday, paving the way for Mr Tusk to return to power. Mr Tusk was previously prime minister of Poland between 2007 and 2014, later becoming European Council president.  October's elections saw his pro-EU coalition win a majority of seats with a record turnout of more than 70%.  The grouping comprises three parties, Mr Tusk's Civic Coalition (KO), the Third Way and the Left. Coalition MPs chanted Mr Tusk's name and sang the national anthem after the vote to designate him as prime minister.  Among those expected to be nominated to the new cabinet is Radoslaw Sikorski, who previously served as foreign minister under Mr Tusk. Expectations for the new coalition are high. The new government has pledged to restore the independence of the judiciary, which it says has been systematically undermined under previous administrations. ""We are working… on a whole set of measures that will restore the rule of law as much as possible,"" Mr Tusk said. He has also pledged to unblock €36bn (£30bn) of EU funds earmarked for Poland, which Brussels has refused to release over rule of law concerns.  A 2020 court decision which banned abortion in almost all cases will also be reversed, he said, while protections for LGBT people will be strengthened. Mr Duda's decision to nominate Mr Morawiecki to form a government without any hope of winning a vote of confidence indicates that the president, who will be in office until 2025, intends to stymie Mr Tusk's plans.  To become law, bills approved by parliament need to be signed by Mr Duda, who can veto them. Mr Tusk's coalition does not have enough MPs to override a presidential veto. The agreement aims to improve the sharing of information and expertise to tackle illegal migration. President Zelensky has said the protests show solidarity between Poland and Ukraine is waning. Lawmakers are set to investigate claims the former government snooped on the phones of its opponents.

BBCNews_68,"Stormont's new education minister has said he plans to meet teaching unions next week to discuss calls for better pay. Paul Givan said he wanted the ""gap to close"" between wages for school staff in Northern Ireland and their counterparts in Great Britain. He was speaking as he visited a Catholic grammar school in Belfast. It was the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) assembly member's first official ministerial engagement. In January teaching and non-teaching staff were among the thousands of public sector workers who joined Northern Ireland's biggest strike for decades, calling for better pay and conditions. The UK government has offered funding to settle public sector pay disputes, but Stormont parties say more money is needed. Mr Givan said resolving the industrial dispute was his top priority. ""We need to have teachers and non-teachers being properly rewarded for the excellent work that they carry out,"" he said. Asked if there would be pay parity between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, he said: ""Well, when it comes to closing that gap, I want the gap to close."" He said he would be ""making the case"" for pay increases but acknowledged there would be ""constraints"" on the level of funding available to the new power-sharing executive, which was restored last week following a two-year hiatus. Mr Givan said he would consider introducing legislation to curb the costs of school uniforms. But he did not commit to introducing a cap - a measure the DUP said it supported in its 2022 assembly election manifesto. ""The uniform issue is something that I do want to take forward,"" he said. ""I'll be discussing with officials if a legislative solution is required. We do have very clear guidance whenever it comes to uniform policy that schools should be taking into account. ""But clearly if the guidance isn't being followed, then I need to look at other alternatives to that."" Mr Givan also said schools should not be used for ""cultural wars"" or as a place to ""further political ideologies"". He was speaking about a DUP campaign he supported objecting to changes introduced at Westminster last year to relationships and sex education (RSE) in Northern Ireland. The new regulations make it compulsory for all post-primary schools in Northern Ireland to teach pupils about access to abortion and prevention of early pregnancy. In a social media post in 2023, Mr Givan said ""radicals"" were seeking to use the changes to ""bring forward their woke agenda"". On Thursday, Mr Givan said the move was ""disrespecting the devolution settlement"". He said the DUP campaign objecting to RSE changes was about ensuring ""our school environment doesn't become a place for cultural wars to take place"". Mr Givan's first official visit as education minister was to Rathmore Grammar School - a Catholic school on the outskirts of west Belfast. The DUP assembly member for Lagan Valley said he was ""sending out a very clear statement that I'm here to be a minister for everybody in Northern Ireland"". On Wednesday, the new minister also signalled his support for the Special Educational Needs (SEN) sector, saying children with special needs ""should be getting the same education as any other child in mainstream education"". But speaking on the BBC's Nolan Live programme, Mr Givan said the sector faced a ""real pressure-point in terms of capacity"". ""Even this year alone the department has spent £30m more than what was anticipated in emergency provision and trying to enhance the capacity,"" he said. ""And going forward, this is going to continue to rise in terms of the numbers, and I'm not talking about hundreds.   ""Over the next 10 years the numbers of children that we're projected that is going to need special support is going to rise by thousands and therefore there is a real challenge."" In 2022-23 more than 10,000 children received SEN provision in Northern Ireland but figures show a pattern of rising demand. Last year, there was a 15% rise in the number of children with a statement of special educational needs (SEN) seeking a school place. That meant 853 additional pupil places were required in special schools and 400 places were needed in specialist classes within mainstream schools. Sources within the party confirmed that the East Antrim MP stepped down from the role this week. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson claims he was threatened due to a ""stirring up"" of tensions over Stormont talks. Luke Poots faced complaints about planning committee decisions his father lobbied on. Caoimhe Archibald says the offer does not provide a ""sustainable solution"" to public sector pay demands. Michelle O'Neill and Gerry Kelly were not the first from the party to attend a passing out ceremony. Copyright 2024 BBC.

BBCNews_69,"As North American consumer uptake of electric vehicles crawls, companies are focusing on upgraded hybrid cars. Will they be baby steps to widespread EV adoption? After a year of slowed EV adoption in the US left auto giants including Ford with billions of dollars in losses, some car makers are rethinking their business strategies. Instead of pushing an all-electric future onto a consumer worried about where to get their next charge, many are embracing an old-school approach: the hybrid.  Hybrid cars, first introduced to the US at the dawn of the millennium with the Toyota Prius and Honda Insight, are a renewed focus. Some consumers took to these vehicles immediately, and global sales of the Prius peaked in 2012, yet adoption dropped in recent years amid a shift in consumer preferences for large SUVs and pickup trucks over smaller cars. However, companies have introduced a wider array of hybrid vehicles into their already beloved fleets – think Jeep, which offers the popular plug-in hybrid model, the 4xe. Showcasing these vehicles could be a good strategy for auto companies, who are finding that consumers are interested in more efficient cars, yet still not ready to take the jump to full EVs. They can serve as a toe-in-the-water approach for electric-curious consumers, to eventually get them comfortable enough to make the switch.  Some data shows drivers are already expressing increasing interest in hybrids. Honda, which is one of the highest volume manufacturers of internal combustion engines in the world, says half of its best-selling cars, the Accord and CR-V, are now hybrids. That's up from 8%-to-10% in the past few years, according to Chris Martin, Honda's regulatory, legal and technology communications manager in the US. The company, which has a goal of electrifying all its vehicles by 2040 as it pursues net zero carbon emissions by 2050, is meeting consumer demand with more hybrid options. Honda sees hybrids as an opportunity to help drivers with internal combustion engines lower emissions in the short term, while also having a positive experience on their electric platform with superior performance and stunning fuel economy – up to 600 miles (966km) for some models. This is a significant improvement over many fully electric vehicles, which only offer half the range (a major barrier for EV adoption for North American consumers). Once comfortable with the technology, the hope is consumers will want to transition to the more planet-friendly all-electric vehicle. In the case of the soon-to-be released Prologue EV, Honda is betting that hundreds of thousands of Accord and CR-V hybrid owners will take the leap.  Similarly, Kia's hybrids are playing an important role in its electrified strategy. Backed by a $25bn (£19.8bn) investment, the company is offering a range of electrification options across its lines, like with the Niro, which is available in an EV, hybrid and plug-in. ""It's a nice bridge to full electrification for people who can't charge at home or at work,"" James Bell, a spokesperson for Kia America, told the BBC at CES 2024. Stellantis is also leveraging its hybrids to transition its customer base to EVs. ""We have the best-selling plug-in,"" says global energy and charging senior vice president Ricardo Stamatti, referring to the hybrid Jeep 4xe. They are simultaneously introducing the all-EV Jeep Recon and Jeep Wagoneer S to its 4xe line-up this year, which could be a potential next step for consumers. The faster the transition to EVs, the better for the environment. However, a slower uptake may also provide the window to develop better infrastructure to support a massive fleet of EVs on the road.  With one of the most cited roadblocks to EV adoption being lack of adequate fast-charging, competitors Honda, Kia, Hyundai, Stellantis, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and General Motors joined forces last summer to form a consortium to build more than 30,000 high-powered DC stations across North America by 2030. Other initiatives both on the local and federal levels in countries including the US and Canada are moving along the installation of charging infrastructure, too, though it will take time. These changes can potentially pave a pathway to the consumer confidence drivers need to take that final step to go fully electric, especially as EV costs are expected to come down throughout the next few years, which has also been a consumer concern. Akshay Singh, automotive partner at global strategy-consulting firm PwC, expects EV adoption to take off around 2026 and 2027. This all could spell good news for a future EV transition. However, depending on how consumers react to these new hybrid offerings, it's also possible that these models may become a regular presence on the road or the long haul. Lawsuits, art and a sandy mole-rat have all played a part in Ukraine's fight for environmental justice in the wake of Russia's invasion. But efforts can only go so far while war rages. Netflix's new live-action take on massively popular animation Avatar: The Last Airbender exploits fans' nostalgia, rather than working on its own terms. For the first time, consumers will have a vast pool of used EVs available for purchase. Will hesitant drivers buy them? From Australia to Ontario, cities are taking up unnecessary stretches of concrete and asphalt, allowing nature to take hold in their place.

BBCNews_71,"When alleged ballot-stuffing was caught on camera in a New England city, Donald Trump and his supporters seized on the voting scandal as evidence of a purported wider problem. But experts say election fraud is rare - and that this case stems from the unique and tumultuous local politics.  Some voters in Bridgeport are confused. Others are just plain disgusted. ""It's hard to find out who the heck is telling the truth,"" says one woman out shopping with her husband near Bridgeport's City Hall. ""We don't vote,"" another tells me flatly, pausing momentarily on her way to a coffee shop, ""because of what's going on."" What's going on is a controversy that has not only upended Bridgeport's mayoral race, but has caught the eye of former US President Trump and others who say voter fraud is a serious problem across the United States. In September, leaked surveillance video appeared to show several people stuffing ballots into Bridgeport's voting drop boxes. The alleged box-stuffers included allies of Bridgeport's Mayor, Joe Ganim.  The city leader won the Democratic primary in September over his rival John Gomes by 250 votes, out of more than 8,000 cast, and later eked out an even narrower victory in November's general election. But the videotape led a judge to rule that the primary results could not be trusted. He ordered another election. And on Tuesday, the Democrats will re-run their primary. It's a case that has attracted attention far beyond this city of 150,000 people on the north shore of Long Island Sound, about an hour from New York City. ""This is just a 'tiny' part of what's happening in our country with voting,"" Mr Trump declared in a post on his Truth Social network. ""It's all a giant scam!"" Many Republicans continue to believe that widespread voter fraud swung the 2020 election, although the former president has failed to provide hard proof of his claims and numerous lawsuits have been dismissed. Mr Trump's own attorney general said there was no evidence of fraud that could have impacted the result.  Every year in the US, there are a handful of electoral fraud convictions relating to votes cast for candidates from either of the two main parties, though such cases involve a relatively tiny number of ballots. Experts and political operatives say that the unique circumstances of politics in Bridgeport - rather than grand unified theories of voter fraud - are a much better explanation of recent events here. ""Our elections, by and large, are safe and secure,"" says Connecticut's top elections official, Secretary of the State Stephanie Thomas, a Democrat. ""We have had cases of fraud, as many other states have had,"" Ms Thomas says. ""But we catch them."" The showdown between Mayor Ganim and Mr Gomes - who for several years worked under the mayor in City Hall - is just the latest tussle in a political environment that one local newspaper described as ""so complicated and splintered by numerous factions and allegiances that insiders compare it to Beirut"".  The leaked surveillance footage comes from cameras that were pointed at several absentee ballot drop boxes in Bridgeport. The judge ruled that two women allied with Mayor Ganim had put multiple ballots in the boxes on up to 15 occasions, in violation of local election laws. In court, both women declined to answer questions, citing their constitutional right to avoid self-incrimination. The mayor hit back and pointed out that supporters of Mr Gomes had been seen on camera doing the exact same thing. In many other places around the US, delivering multiple ballots in this way is both common and perfectly legal - a tactic known as ""ballot harvesting"". It's used by a range of political campaigns and organisations to gather early votes from their supporters. The Covid pandemic prompted many states to loosen their rules around absentee and postal voting, and allies of the mayor say that postal ballots ensure elderly and disabled voters - Bridgeport has relatively high proportions of both - can participate in the political process. But Connecticut's rules are much stricter than many other states. Only family members, caregivers - or, in certain circumstances, police officers or voting officials - can handle absentee ballots. The people caught on camera were not authorised to do it. Mayor Ganim's critics - his challenger chief among them - say that the incident has exposed the underbelly of a type of corrupt Democratic party ""machine politics"" in the city. It's a charge the mayor vehemently denies. Mr Gomes arrived in Bridgeport from Cape Verde, an island nation off the west coast of Africa, at the age of nine. He grew up in The Hollow, a working-class neighbourhood of Bridgeport, before forging a business career. The challenger says that corruption scandals are holding this city back - and he's running as a reformer. Over lunch at a Portuguese cafe - football and Portuguese news plays on the TVs behind the bar - a steady stream of his friends and supporters come up to greet him. ""These are my roots in the city,"" he says. ""I care about Bridgeport. I am Bridgeport - my kids grew up here. It's made me what I am today."" Mayor Ganim, the incumbent, has a long and controversial history in local politics. He first took over the mayor's office in 1991, but in the early 2000s was convicted on racketeering and corruption charges and spent seven years in federal prison. Once out, he went on an apology tour and won back the mayor's office in 2015. Reached by phone days before the primary re-run, Mayor Ganim said he was committed to transparency, and welcomed the appointment of two state election monitors. ""The videos speak for themselves,"" he says. ""The court found irregularities… we now need to focus on this very important primary."" Complicating the picture is the personal history between the mayor and his challenger. Mr Gomes supported Mayor Ganim's comeback, and was appointed to a senior administrative post - but the mayor later fired him, alleging that Mr Gomes was ineffective and doled out jobs to relatives. The mayor called Mr Gomes's campaign a ""vendetta"" waged for personal reasons rather than a real effort at reform. And he dismissed the charge that Bridgeport's politics are blatantly corrupt. ""It's flattering to say that there's a Democratic machine and press a button and it rolls into power,"" he says. ""But it's just not true."" Lennie Grimaldi, a supporter of Mayor Ganim and a journalist who writes a blog called Only in Bridgeport, points out that both campaigns have requested hundreds of absentee ballot applications in advance of Tuesday's primary.  When it comes to maximising the absentee vote, he says, ""both sides do it"". ""Politics in Bridgeport is a highly competitive sport,"" he adds. Others see a more systemic problem. ""This has been a pattern for decades,"" says Jonathan Wharton, assistant professor of political science at nearby Southern Connecticut State University. ""The old ways have some staying power."" Over eggs at a café in Bridgeport's downtown, Prof Wharton says reform efforts throughout the 20th Century reined in some of the immense sway wielded over elections by party political machines in big cities across the north-east US.  But Bridgeport, he says, has been a lot slower to change. Republicans in the state, even those that don't buy into Mr Trump's mass voter fraud narrative, have argued for the elimination of drop boxes and called for same-day voting. Democrats, who control the state legislature and governor's office, have gone the other way, and have started to loosen rules, allowing ""no-excuse"" absentee voting and, for the first time, early voting locations. Like their party counterparts around the country, they've argued in favour of making it easier to vote. But the new rules won't come in until November, and pundits expect voter turnout in the mayoral re-run will be low - perhaps less than 20% - because of the cold weather, voter fatigue and ebbing faith in the system. ""You have this malaise among voters where the sense is that no matter who you elect to office, whether somebody who's a reform-oriented politician or somebody who follows the party line, they're all for themselves,"" Prof Wharton says. ""So what's the point of showing up to vote?"" What's more, if Mr Gomes wins, voters face the possibility of yet another vote - a general election re-run next month. If there's one thing nearly everyone involved in Bridgeport politics agrees with, however, it's that the situation here doesn't support wider allegations of voter fraud. Both candidates dismissed the claims. And Prof Wharton, who used to work for a Republican congressman, calls the situation in Bridgeport an anomaly - not only in the US, but within Connecticut. ""This is very provincial,"" he says. ""What's happening here we don't see in many other municipalities. Bridgeport is unique."" The former president moves closer to the Republican nomination with a huge win in his rival's home state. Trump celebrated ""Republican unity"" after winning the South Carolina primary - but his rival is staying in the race.

BBCNews_72,"Two referendums to change Ireland’s constitution regarding gender and family will be held on 8 March 2024. The government has approved the draft wording for the two proposed changes, which will provide for a wider concept of family and women’s role in society. To be held on International Women's Day, the amendments will “reinforce the fact that Ireland is a modern, inclusive nation strives to treat and care for all its people equally,” Taoiseach (prime minister) Leo Varadkar said. The General Scheme of the Thirty-Ninth Amendment of the Constitution Bill (the Family amendment) proposes to insert the words “whether founded on marriage or on other durable relationships”.   The current protection afforded to families under the constitution, as currently written, only extends to married families.  These proposals extend this constitutional right to other lasting relationships and puts them on an equal footing with married families, according to the government.  Announcing the referendums, Mr Varadkar said: “Our constitution will continue its history protecting both the family and the institution of marriage.  ""Repurposing the wording, however, acknowledges the families may also be founded on lasting relationships other than marriage. ""For example, a family headed by a lone parent, or a family headed by a grandparent or guardian all of us know people who are committed to each other in a loving relationship over a sustained period of time, who are not married.” The General Scheme of the Fortieth Amendment of the Constitution Bill (the Care amendment) proposes to delete the wording: “In particular, the state recognises that by her life within the home, woman gives to the state a support without which the common good cannot be achieved”. It will insert the following wording: “The state recognises that the provision of care, by members of a family to one another by reason of the bonds that exist among them, gives to society a support without which the common good cannot be achieved, and shall strive to support such provision.” This article of the constitution is commonly referred to as a section about the “woman’s place is in the home”, which campaigners have long called for the removal of. Making the announcement, Minister for Integration Roderic O'Gorman said that ""a woman's place is where ever she wants it to be"". “The archaic reference to a woman's place in the home has not been good for the lives of women in this country.  ""The key is that women choose the roles they play in our society,"" Minister O'Gorman said.  ""This referendum will offer another opportunity to move away from the Ireland of 1937 to continue that journey to becoming a kinder a more inclusive society and one that acknowledges and respects the needs of all citizens.” Education Minister Norma Foley welcomed the proposed changes to update the constitution which is almost 100 years old. “The wonderful carers in our homes include both men and women. There are families where it is the dad who stays at home and the mum works outside the home, families where one parent juggles children in childcare to part time employments, it can be tiring and relentless work,"" she said. “We want to move on to say we need to recognize the dynamic and diverse arrangements the Irish families today. It will update the definition of the Irish family in a clear and compassionate way as it is defined in article 41 as the fundamental human group of society and indispensable to the welfare of the nation and the state.  ""The men and women of Easter 1916 pledged to cherish all of the children of the nation equally as the government we want to continue with that.” The government has called for a well informed and courteous campaign, noting that previous referendums, including the most recent on abortion rights, had been divisive.

BBCNews_73,"The biggest news story of 2001 was the 11 September terrorist attacks in New York and Washington. And, as newly-released state papers from the Public Records Office of Northern Ireland (PRONI) show, they had far-reaching implications. One file shows that there were concerns about the likely impact on the economy. Within weeks of 9/11, British Airways cancelled its Heathrow to Belfast Aldergrove route and 30,000 fewer US visitors to NI were expected for 2002. The file also said that up to 1,600 redundancies were anticipated in Bombardier Aerospace in Belfast. The potential for wider terrorist threats was considered most likely to come from chemical or biological attacks - ""the main risks identified here are anthrax, smallpox, botulism and nerve gases such as sarin"", the file said. Greater scrutiny was expected of the destination of EU structural funds that were allocated to groups which included ex-prisoners with paramilitary backgrounds. The latest release of state papers from the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland covers the years between 1997 to 2001.  A surprising absence from the files from 2001 is any reference to the stand-off at Holy Cross Primary School in Ardoyne, north Belfast, in contrast to the extent of coverage in the recently released files from the National Archives of Ireland, released on Wednesday. These might yet come in subsequent releases or the gap might reflect the reserved status of justice and security matters at the time. A number of issues which remain current today are reflected in files dating back over 25 years.  The question of providing a national football stadium was discussed in 1997 as part of the proposed relocation of the Premiership side Wimbledon FC to Belfast, to be renamed Belfast United. Ronnie Spence, the then permanent secretary of the Department of the Environment, hoped that a Belfast-based team would ""be able to build up strong cross-community support"". His optimism that the city's reputation would be enhanced by association with a team ""performing at the top level in English and European competitions"" was viewed as ""a brave prediction"" by his counterpart in the Department of Economic Development, Gerry Loughran, who noted Wimbledon's mid-table status in the Premiership and failure to qualify for European competitions. Tensions between both men did not quite reach fever pitch though Loughran, recommending the writings of Nick Hornby to Mr Spence, was sceptical that local football fans would transfer their allegiances from English and Scottish teams. These were ""bonds for life"" in which ""the passion never dulls"". Then Northern Ireland secretary, Mo Mowlam was also dubious about a proposal she did not think was ""particularly safe"", although Prime Minister Tony Blair thought ""it would be excellent if Wimbledon were to move to Belfast"". Dr Mowlam and Mr Blair were also at odds in 1998 over her desire to consider reform of Northern Ireland's law on abortion. It was proposed to establish an independent review panel, chaired by the Lord Chief Justice to ""inquire into the legal, medical and social issues"" surrounding abortion law and practice in Northern Ireland and also to explore ""related issues including sex education, access to counselling, and support services for pregnant women"". Dr Mowlam's proposed review was vetoed by the prime minister who advised putting it ""on ice for now"", in view of the likely lack of ""scope for bi-communal support for a change to the law"". On the domestic political scene, the processes governing the newly-established assembly were still evolving in 1999. Peter Robinson, then deputy leader of the DUP, objected to a proposed extension to the Ministerial Code of Conduct which he interpreted as having ""more to do with gaining control by the centre and in particular the first and deputy first ministers over ministerial colleagues"", reflective of what he saw as ""an unhealthy addition to empire building and authoritarianism"". The risk of pollution to Lough Neagh is the subject of a file dating back to the 1950s, when there was a proposal to locate a nuclear power plant there. The Nobel Physics laureate John Cockroft, of the UK's Atomic Energy Authority, advised Northern Ireland's prime minister, Lord Brookeborough, against siting it at Lough Neagh. The increasing reliance on Lough Neagh as a source for Belfast's water supply made the authority ""considerably less happy about the choice of Lough Neagh for a nuclear power station site"". Although Mr Cockroft was confident that no ""radiological hazard would result from normal operation of the power station… the possibility of an accident leading to over-heating… and some release of radioactive products"" was too great a risk. The warning came only 10 months after the UK's most serious nuclear accident, a fire at the Windscale (now Sellafield) plant in Cumbria in October 1957. This undoubtedly made the Atomic Energy Authority more risk averse, but it also raises the question of whether a nuclear power station would have been built at Lough Neagh if Windscale had not happened. Professor Marie Coleman is Professor of Twentieth Century Irish History at Queen's University Belfast The Earl of Shaftesbury, who owns the lakebed, has met the environment minister, Andrew Muir. The environment minister says he is looking forward to 'frank and open' discussions this week. Lord Shaftesbury approached the agriculture, environment and rural affairs minister for a meeting. The locations are in counties Fermanagh and Tyrone but neither are currently considered a concern. The new environment minister visits Lough Neagh which has been blighted by toxic algae.

BBCNews_74,"Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman to sit on the US Supreme Court, has died aged 93. She died on Friday morning in Phoenix, Arizona due to complications related to dementia and a respiratory illness, a statement by the US Supreme Court said. A moderate conservative, Justice O'Connor was appointed to America's highest court by former president Ronald Reagan in 1981.  She served as justice for more than 24 years until her retirement in 2006.  She left the bench to care for her husband, John Jay O'Connor, who was battling Alzheimer's disease. President George W Bush appointed Justice Samuel Alito as her replacement. In a statement, US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts called Justice O'Connor ""a daughter of the American Southwest"" who ""blazed a historic trail as our Nation's first female Justice.""  ""She met that challenge with undaunted determination, indisputable ability, and engaging candor,"" Justice Roberts said. He added that she was a ""fiercely independent defender of the rule of law, and an eloquent advocate for civics education.""   Justice O'Connor was born in El Paso, Texas, and grew up on her family's cattle ranch near Duncan, Arizona. She then went on to receive her law degree from Stanford University.  In her first job, she said she had agreed to work for nothing, with no office, for a county attorney in San Mateo, California. ""No-one gave me a job,"" Justice O'Connor told the International Bar Association in 2011. ""It was very frustrating because I had done very well in both undergraduate and law school and my male classmates weren't having any problems."" Despite the difficulties of being a woman in law, she went on to become Deputy County Attorney of San Mateo County in California and later Assistant Attorney General of Arizona.  A Republican, she was appointed to the Arizona State Senate in 1969 and was re-elected to two two-year terms. A groundbreaking politician, she became the first woman anywhere in the US to serve as a majority leader in a state senate.  In 1974, she left party politics and was elected to the Maricopa County Superior Court, before being appointed to the Arizona Court of Appeals in 1979.  During his campaign for the presidency, Ronald Reagan vowed to appoint a woman to the US Supreme Court, in what some reporters at the time said was a bid to tackle his low polling among women.  When nominating her to the court in 1981, Mr Reagan said that she was ""truly a person for all seasons, possessing those unique qualities of temperament, fairness, intellectual capacity, and devotion to the public good"". The Senate approved her nomination in a unanimous vote of 99-0.  She was regarded by many as the most powerful woman in the country at the time, as Justice O'Connor was a decisive vote on influential Supreme Court cases. Among her most impactful decisions was her 1992 ruling in Planned Parenthood v Casey, which reaffirmed women's right to abortion. Her replacement, Justice Alito, would go on to author the majority decision that overturned that right in 2022.  Justice O'Connor was also the deciding vote in the Bush v Gore case in 2000.  That year, Republican George W Bush and Democrat Al Gore fought a closely contested election for the presidency, and legal battles over a recount ensued. Justice O'Connor voted with the 5-4 majority to halt any legal challenges to the results of the election, effectively putting President George W Bush in the White House. But she ruled against the Bush administration's post-9/11 detainee policy in 2004, in which the court decided that due process was required for US citizens who are detained. ""A state of war is not a blank check for the President when it comes to the rights of the Nation's citizens,"" Justice O'Connor wrote in the court's plurality opinion.  In an open letter in 2018, she revealed that she had been diagnosed with dementia, saying it marked the end of her role in public life.  ""How fortunate I feel to be an American and to have been presented with the remarkable opportunities available to the citizens of our country,"" she wrote. ""As a young cowgirl from the Arizona desert, I never could have imagined that one day I would become the first woman justice on the US Supreme Court."" ""I hope that I have inspired young people about civic engagement and helped pave the pathway for women who mayhave faced obstacles pursuing their careers.""  On Friday, senior politicians of major both parties were quick to pay tribute to O'Connor.  ""Sandra Day O'Connor was a trailblazer,"" wrote House Speaker, Republican Mike Johnson. ""Justice O'Connor inspired a generation of women - including the five female Justices that succeeded her - to chart a path that previously seemed unattainable.""  Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski hailed O'Connor as ""an inspiration who impacted an entire generation of young women who saw that it was possible to serve our country in the highest office"".  And Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar said the late justice's ""example showed us that anything and everything is possible"".  Justice O'Connor is survived by three sons and six grandchildren. Her husband died in 2009.  The man who burned himself in Washington DC is an active-duty US airman, local media report. After Alabama rules that frozen embryos are children, some fertility patients pray that lawmakers find a solution.

BBCNews_75,"Joe Biden is caught in a dilemma with no good options - to get what he wants, the US president may have to reward his political enemies while angering his allies. That's an uncomfortable position ahead of an election year. This week began with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visiting Washington to plead for more US military aid from Congress.  It ended with Mr Biden and Senate Democrats considering just how far they would be willing to bend in order to fulfil his wish - and just how angry they would be willing to make members of their own party in the process.  Republicans are setting conditions for more Ukraine aid - included in a $100bn (£82bn) package that also contains support for Israel and Taiwan - that begin and end with immigration.  That includes not just more money for border security, but also significant changes to the way in which undocumented migrants at the US-Mexico border seeking asylum protections are processed.  Among the measures under consideration are raising the bar for migrants to qualify for asylum consideration in the US and making it easier to deport undocumented entrants without a hearing when border-crossings surge.  The Biden administration reportedly wants to preserve the president's flexibility to provide exceptions to these rules. The White House would not comment on what hard-line Republican options might be on the table. It is clear, however, exactly how angry some Democrats on the left would be if Mr Biden agreed to such changes. ""I thought I entered a time machine back to the Trump era,"" Democratic Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey said at a Congressional Hispanic Caucus rally on the steps of the US Capitol.  ""I could not comprehend how a Democratic president who vehemently countered Trump's policies as a candidate is seriously putting forward the most Trumpian anti-immigrant proposal."" Other legislators condemned the negotiations as a Republican trap and expressed outrage that liberal legislators and Hispanic politicians were left out of the closed-door meetings.  They said the Biden administration would never consider bargaining away other liberal priorities like abortion freedoms, education or civil rights in exchange for a one-time foreign aid bill.  Why, they asked, was immigration different? Public opinion polling provides a clue. While Democrats have majorities on their side for many of their political priorities, a recent Wall Street Journal poll indicated that 64% of Americans disapproved of Mr Biden's handling of border security.  And by a 54% to 24% margin, respondents said Donald Trump, not Mr Biden, was ""best able"" to secure the border. Beto O'Rourke, who once represented the Texas border town of El Paso in Congress and ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2019, tells BBC's Americast that Mr Biden needs to reclaim the moral high ground in the immigration debate.  He wants the president to point out what he says was the cruelty of the Trump-era policies Republicans want to enshrine into law. ""We have not heard that recently from Joe Biden,"" he said. ""And we're not seeing that right now in his policies. But I believe he'll do the right thing."" Mr O'Rourke knows first-hand how hard an issue immigration can be for Democrats.  Last year, he tried to defeat Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott by running a campaign that emphasised abortion rights and gun control, among other issues. The governor focused like a laser on immigration - and ended up winning by almost 11%.  ""If the president and his administration are not able to offer a comprehensive vision and strategy and demonstrate that they have control over the challenges on the border, it opens the field to Donald Trump on a national level,"" Mr O'Rourke said.  Members of the House of Representatives have already left Washington for the winter holidays, but senators will be back next week to try to hammer out a deal that includes Ukraine aid and immigration reform.  It's a hint of progress for the administration - and the opportunity to achieve a foreign policy goal while, perhaps, addressing a political weakness that has bedevilled Mr Biden. The potential risk of alienating liberal allies whose faith in the president has been strained by the ongoing war between Israel and Gaza as well as concessions during budget negotiations earlier this year is high, however. ""For Biden, we're invisible,"" Congressman Luis Gutierrez of Illinois said at the Capitol on Wednesday.  ""They don't do any outreach. They don't do any consultation."" And that, he continued, would have electoral consequences. ""Latinos won't come out to vote,"" he said. ""And our efforts to knock on their doors to canvass and to get them out to vote will only become increasingly more difficult."" The president is caught in a bind. What happens next week will help determine how - or if - he can find a way out. The man who burned himself in Washington DC is an active-duty US airman, local media report. A convoy drives 2,000 miles from south Wales to Ukraine to repay a 40-year-old favour. After Alabama rules that frozen embryos are children, some fertility patients pray that lawmakers find a solution. It is rare for officials to say how many Ukrainian soldiers have died since Russia's full-scale invasion.

BBCNews_76,"Italy has been gripped by a vigilante who calls himself ""Fleximan"" and has made it his mission to tear down as many speed cameras as possible.  Fleximan has already claimed at least 15 successful strikes, and a special police task force and four different prosecutors' offices are now investigating the attacks.  The anonymous vandal began leaving a trail of destruction months ago in the north-east, as more and more of the cameras were put out of action. Photos of his actions then spread on social media, along with the nickname taken from the Italian word for angle grinder, flessibile - the tool he has mostly used to destroy the cameras. The campaign may reflect popular anger about the proliferation of speed cameras, but road deaths in Italy are higher than in many other European countries. What is not clear is whether Fleximan is one man or two, or perhaps he has become a number of copycat vandals. Police in the north-west Piedmont region say they have charged a 50-year-old suspect, but most of the attacks have taken place in the Veneto area of the north-east. At the scene of one of his most recent attacks, the anonymous vigilante left a handwritten message: ""Fleximan is coming."" The vandal's methods are consistent, and the chorus of approval is growing on social media, where Fleximan is treated as a sort of modern Robin Hood.  So much so that a street artist in Padua called Evyrein has dedicated his latest work to Fleximan. His graffiti depicts Uma Thurman's character from Kill Bill, holding a sword in one hand and a cut-up speed camera in the other.  The autovelox, as it is known in Italian, has always been contentious in Europe. But Italy is known to have the highest number on the continent, estimated at more than 11,000. That's a third more than the UK's 7,700 and almost three times as many as in Germany with 4,700. This is likely to explain some of the anger towards the Italian speed detector, and local mayors have said they won't replace the vandalised cameras just yet. The official reason is to calm the situation down. Fines imposed on drivers have risen dramatically in recent years, with Florence taking €23.2m ($25m; £20m) in 2022, according to Italian consumer group Codacons, followed by Milan, Genoa and Rome. But Italy has a less than impressive track record on road safety. The European Transport Safety Council put the number of deaths in Italy per million inhabitants at 54 in 2022, almost twice as many as the 26 per million lives lost in the UK and 37 per million in Spain. For Paola Di Caro, a political journalist with Italian daily newspaper Corriere della Sera, these numbers are highly personal and she has directly challenged Fleximan's narrative of standing up for people's freedom with her own devastating experience. Her 18-year-old son Francesco Valdiserri was knocked down and killed by a speeding driver as he waited for a bus in Rome in October 2022.  ""I would just like [Fleximan] to feel for one day, just one day, what I feel when I go to lay flowers where my son was killed… and then at [the cemetery in] Verano where he was closed forever behind poured concrete."" As she headed to her son's grave, she told the BBC that the Fleximan enigma reflected a culture that tells people they have the right to feel that rules do not apply to them. ""People hail him as a hero, but Fleximan for me is just shameful. The idea that these actions may be done for fun… is just unbearable to me. It is like they are making fun of my son."" The speed camera story has also entered Italian politics, with nationalist League leader Matteo Salvini eyeing an opportunity ahead of regional and European parliamentary elections. Mr Salvini, who is also transport minister and deputy prime minister, has targeted the mayor of Bologna, Matteo Lepore, for bringing in a new 30km/h (18mph) speed limit across the city.  The Bologna speed reduction was signed off by Mr Salvini's own ministry, and inspired by European Commission figures that show the risk of death for pedestrians is eight times higher at 50km/h than at 30km/h. Bologna's reduced speed limit has kickstarted a drivers' protest, and a campaign for a referendum on the issue has attracted more than 52,000 names.  ""The problem is that a 30km/h limit is just too low,"" complained Guendalina Furini, a 22-year-old student who started the petition. ""It takes too long to cross the city, and it does not solve the real problem, which is people driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs,"" she explained. She challenged the mayor at a recent meeting, so far with no success. Although she admits she is no expert on safety statistics she wants her voice to be heard.   ""We have obtained the right to divorce and abortion through referendums, why shouldn't this be decided in that way too? This is not the democracy I am studying at university."" Tony Sheil's partner and daughters do not want others to have a loved one die on the road. The cameras can detect motorists who are not wearing a seatbelt or using phones while driving. Lee Francis says the crash that has paralysed him from the waist down has ""broken his heart"". More police forces are to use the technology to detect drivers flouting law at the wheel.

BBCNews_78,"Javier Milei's victory sends a clear message - Argentines wanted change and he was the candidate most likely to deliver it. His rise to the top was swift. A former economist and pundit, Mr Milei was relatively unknown before winning the primaries back in August. But his brash manner, radical campaign proposals, as well as his unruly hairstyle, got him noticed. In a country mired in economic crisis, where annual inflation is now over 140% and two in five Argentines now live in poverty, a drastic new approach to fixing the problems was a clever move. Many presidents before him have tried, and failed, to improve the situation so there was nothing to lose by promising something very different. The challenge will be how he navigates a country in crisis away from campaign promises and deals with reality - trying to improve the situation for millions of Argentines, not make it worse. So will Argentina see the Mr Milei who has promised to destroy the central bank, slash government spending and introduce the US dollar as Argentina's official currency? Or will there be a toned-down version of Mr Milei waiting in the wings? ""Perhaps he'll moderate his agenda to build public support and win over lawmakers from other parties. Otherwise, expect political gridlock, social uproar, and revolts by unions,"" says Benjamin Gedan, who heads the Argentina Project at the Wilson Center global affairs think tank. ""Many of Milei's supporters voted against their economic interests. Should he dismiss a significant number of government workers, slash social welfare programs, and dramatically increase the price of water, electricity, natural gas, and public transportation, there will be a serious case of buyer's remorse with very real implications for governability."" Mr Milei's victory is being seen as a victory for the far-right beyond Argentina.  Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's team travelled to Buenos Aires to support him and Spain's Vox party has also backed him. But, say experts, his win is more than just about politics. ""Javier Milei's voters are more connected to the economic and the political discontent rather than to purely an ideological 'anarcho-capitalist' or 'anarcho-libertarian' far-right base,"" says Juan Cruz Díaz, managing director at the Cefeidas Group in Buenos Aires. ""I think what explains Milei's victory is mostly connected with the economy and the economic challenges Argentina is facing right now."" And it is not just the economy that Mr Milei wants to shake up. He has also pledged to loosen gun laws and ban abortion - this in a country which in 2020 legalised abortion and helped improve sexual and reproductive health rights for women across what has traditionally been a very conservative region. Mr Milei has also criticised China and Brazil, saying he does not do business with ""communists"". The two countries are Argentina's biggest trading partners. In the wake of his victory, Brazil's President Lula da Silva stopped short of congratulating Mr Milei personally, instead offering his congratulations to the institutions which carried out the electoral process. ""Democracy is the voice of the people and that must always be respected,"" Lula said on X. That sentence is likely both a diplomatic nod to the election results and a subtle dig at Mr Milei. He and his vice-president, Victoria Villarruel, have repeatedly been accused of lacking respect for democracy and calling into question the official number of victims during Argentina's military dictatorship between 1976 and 1983. All told, Mr Milei's victory is a departure for a country with a traditional scene - a scene so often dominated by the Peronist political movement. Instead, there is a new kind of politics forming - one led by a politician often compared to former US President Donald Trump and Brazil's ex-leader Jair Bolsonaro. So yes, Argentines wanted change and Javier Milei said he would deliver it - but what that change will look like is anyone's guess for now. The only thing that is clear is that it will be unlike anything that has come before. Copyright 2024 BBC.

BBCNews_79,"Britney Spears has appeared to apologise to her ex Justin Timberlake for comments in her autobiography. He had told her to have an abortion as he ""didn't want to be a father"", she alleged in The Woman in Me, and cheated on her with ""another celebrity"". But on Monday, she posted a clip of him singing his songs with Jimmy Fallon on NBC's Saturday Night Live programme.   And alongside the Instagram post, she wrote: ""I wanna apologise for some of the things I wrote about in my book."" Spears wrote: ""If I offended any of the people I genuinely care about, I am deeply sorry. ""I also wanted to say I am in love with Justin Timberlake's new song, Selfish. ""It is so good - and how come every time I see Justin and Jimmy together, I laugh so hard?"" Spears released a song in 2011 with the same title, with some Britney fans campaigning to get her Selfish track into the charts higher than Timberlake's new single, according to US media. Spears dated the NSync singer from 1999, when she was aged 17, to 2002.  And after becoming pregnant, she had been unsure whether having an abortion was the right decision, the Baby One More Time singer wrote in her autobiography, released in October 2023. ""If it had been left up to me alone, I never would have done it,"" she wrote. ""And yet Justin was so sure that he didn't want to be a father."" The allegations sparked a social-media backlash - and Timberlake appeared to turn off comments on his Instagram for a while. He has not publicly responded - but in 2021, wrote on Instagram: ""I understand that I fell short in these moments and in many others and benefited from a system that condones misogyny and racism. ""I specifically want to apologise to Britney Spears and Janet Jackson both individually, because I care for and respect these women and I know I failed.""  Spears has been married three times and has two children with her second husband, dancer Kevin Federline. Also in her book, the Toxic singer documented her controversial conservatorship. Calling herself a ""child robot"", she claimed her father told her he had assumed legal control of her personal and professional affairs, by saying: ""I am Britney Spears now."" And last week, following rumours she was planning a return to the studio, Spears said she would ""never return to the music industry"".

BBCNews_80,"A woman charged with carrying out an illegal abortion on herself has been found not guilty on the eve of her trial after the prosecution dropped the case due to ""evidential difficulties"". Bethany Cox, 22, from Eaglescliffe in Stockton, was accused of child destruction and using misoprostol to procure her own miscarriage in 2020. She pleaded not guilty to both charges at Teesside Crown Court in August 2023. Her defence barrister said the case was an ""extraordinary state of affairs"". Jolyon Perks, for the prosecution, told Teesside Crown Court the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) was invited to review the case on 19 December and it was then that the decision was made not to proceed with the charges against Ms Cox. Mr Perks told the court a full review was carried out, before the defence was told on 22 December the case would not proceed as the CPS was ""not in possession of key evidence"" and there was ""no real prospect of a conviction"". Nicholas Lumley KC, for Ms Cox, said it was an ""extraordinary state of affairs"", adding that she gave birth in July 2020, at the end of the first Covid-19 lockdown, and ""in the throes of grief"" she was interviewed by police and was under investigation for three years before being charged and appearing in court in July 2023. It is not known how or when the baby died. Mr Lumley said it was ""beyond regrettable"" and Ms Cox had suffered so extensively, all the while ""grieving for what took place"".  Judge Paul Watson, the recorder of Middlesbrough, said the court had ""no choice"" but to direct a not guilty verdict on both charges. Ms Cox did not appear at Teesside Crown Court on Tuesday. The two charges dated from the beginning of July 2020. She was charged under Section 58 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, which makes it an offence for a woman to unlawfully procure her own abortion. The first charge stated that on 6 July in Stockton she administered drugs to procure an abortion with the intent to destroy the life of a child capable of being born alive. The second alleged that between 2 and 7 July she administered misoprostol with ""intent to procure your own miscarriage"". A CPS spokesperson said: ""Cases of this nature are carefully considered and a prosecution will only take place where the evidential standard has been met.

BBCNews_81,"Argentines will vote on Sunday in a run-off election to choose the man who will lead the South American country for the next four years.  Opinion polls put the two candidates, left-wing economy minister Sergio Massa and far-right libertarian Javier Milei, neck and neck.  Mr Massa won the first round with 36.7%, ahead of Mr Milei with 30%. But polls suggest Mr Milei, who has promised to ""blow up"" Argentina's political system, has made gains since. Polling gets under way at 08:00 local time (11:00 GMT) and closes at 18:00. With 40% of Argentines living in poverty, high prices and skyrocketing inflation are by far voters' top concerns.  It therefore came as a surprise to many when Mr Massa, who has been at the helm of the ministry of the economy as the country's annual inflation rate reached a whopping 143%, beat Mr Milei into second place during the first round on 22 October. But as he was short of the 45% of votes needed to win outright, Mr Massa now faces Mr Milei again in the decisive run-off. The candidate who came third on 22 October, conservative Patricia Bullrich, has thrown her weight behind Mr Milei, and polls suggest most of her voters will back the self-proclaimed anarcho-capitalist.  And while a majority of surveys are giving Mr Milei a slight lead over his rival, Sunday's run-off looks set to be a nail-biting finish to an acrimonious election campaign. Javier Milei, 53, is an economist whose anti-establishment rhetoric has gained him a loyal following especially among young voters disillusioned with traditional politics. His Libertarian party, which he founded in 2018, is seen by voters as untainted by mistakes of the past and much of his appeal stems from the fact that voters are willing to give his radical proposals a chance after decades of economic upheaval.  Mr Milei has promised to replace the local currency, the peso, with the US dollar, and said he would ""blow up"" Argentina's central bank. He likes to court controversy on social issues, too, saying he will abolish sex education in schools, loosen gun laws and allow the sale and purchase of human organs. Prone to outbursts and swearing, he has even attacked Pope Francis, whom he accused of being a communist.  The flamboyant economist, who likes to appear at events wearing a leather jacket and wielding a chainsaw, has devoted followers who mob him wherever he goes.  Sergio Massa, 51, a seasoned politician who led the Chamber of Deputies before becoming economy minister in the Peronist government in 2022, has been trying to convince voters that he has the experience to steer the country out of its economic slump. He says he is the man who will guarantee that Argentina's poor will continue getting welfare payments and subsidised public transport.  On social issues he is liberal, backing Argentina's recent legalisation of abortion. He has also warned of the dangers of climate change, in contrast to Mr Milei, who is a climate-change sceptic. And while Mr Massa has been trying to sway undecided voters by encouraging them to vote against Mr Milei - whom he portrays as a liability -  he is unlikely to be able to win over a considerable proportion of Argentines who have told pollsters from company CB Consultoras that they are so fed up with his Peronist party that they ""would never vote"" for him.

BBCNews_82,"Inspired by a trailblazing transgender model, Malta has become one of the most accepting countries in the world in the past 20 years. It was a sweltering afternoon at Balluta Bay sometime in the late 1990s. Eager young journalist Ramona Depares was celebrating her first job at a local magazine at the City of London, one of Malta's oldest seafront bars, when a woman walked in. ""Everyone stopped talking, openly staring,"" Depares said. ""I remember she was wearing her iconic, massive black hat and a slinky black pantsuit – this was midweek, mid-afternoon, when everyone else was in flip flops. But it wasn't only about her clothes, it was her aura. She behaved like royalty. It was difficult not to be entranced."" This mysterious figure was international Maltese model and trans pioneer Katya Saunders, known to friends as Kaka. As Depares would soon learn, Saunders' life was as compelling as her glamorous career: in the 1970s, she moved to London and transitioned; while in the 1980s she was pictured in Vogue on the arm of Karl Lagerfeld, did photoshoots in New York and modelled for fashion designers Charles & Ron, who still own a store in the Maltese capital Valletta. Rumour had it she'd even hung out with David Bowie and Mick Jagger. After an introduction, Depares and Saunders started chatting. ""I asked whether she would give me an interview,"" said Depares. ""And for years she played cat and mouse with me for this blessed interview, despite bumping into her at parties or fashion shows. She said she'd prefer to have her memoirs published instead."" Eventually Saunders disappeared from public life, having ""fallen upon hard times"", as Depares put it. Fast-forward to 2019 and the journalist was in the Times of Malta's office when news of her death broke. ""I wrote her tribute thinking, well, at least she'd be happy to know that her death made waves across the Maltese media."" Depares pictured her ""giggling away, enjoying the commotion that she was once again causing"". Since then, Saunders' trailblazing life as one of Malta's first openly transgender public personas has been reappraised on an island that's seen remarkable changes in the last two decades. One of only five nations in the world to have made LGBTQ+ rights equal at a constitutional level, it has held first place for eight years on the ILGA-Europe Rainbow Index, which ranks countries on LGBTQ+ equality. After first visiting Valletta's hilly streets half a decade ago, I've been intrigued by this tiny island nation's unlikely rise as one of the world's most tolerant places. To examine how this happened, let's start by rewinding to the years after Saunders' birth in 1957. In 1964, Malta achieved independence after more than 150 years of British rule. The Brits had criminalised male same-sex relations, but as a republic, Malta legalised same-sex activity in 1973, with an age of consent of 16, equal to heterosexual sex. In 2001, the creation of the lobbying group Malta Gay Rights Movement (MGRM) helped usher in Malta's inaugural Pride March in 2004, as well as a national gay helpline. The pace quickened in the next decade: Malta was the first country in the EU to ban conversion therapy in 2016, when same-sex marriage was also passed, and the first European state to add gender identity to its constitution as a protected category. What was Malta's first Pride March like 20 years ago? ""Not a big affair,"" said MGRM's Joe Grima. ""It attracted between 50 and 100 people, whereas by [2023's] EuroPride, 38,000 attended the march and concert headlined by Christina Aguilera. We could celebrate how far we came. The laws that safeguard equal rights are now a normal aspect of everyday life in Malta."" These laws were not in place for young Saunders or for other LGBTQ+ people of her era, however. As a result, the MGRM and Malta Council decided to celebrate her legacy by commissioning Depares to write the book Katya: Easy on the Tonic (a nod to Saunders' favourite catchphrase), and curating exhibitions featuring her clothes, portraits and accessories at galleries in Valletta, including one at Valletta's historic cultural hub Spazju Kreattiv (view the online archive here). Another Saunders exhibit (which closed in 2023) was curated by multi-disciplinary artists Romeo Roxman Gatt and Charlie Cauchi. The duo also founded Malta's only LGBTQ+ gallery Rosa Kwir in Balzan – a must for visitors – which showcases stories from the community and ""challenges the norms and stereotypes"", said Cauchi. For inspiration, they looked deep into Malta's queer history – and discovered a fascinating tale predating Saunders' by two centuries. ""We named the gallery Rosa Kwir after Rosa Mifsud, an intersex teenager [from the town of Luqa, Malta] who fought for his right to be recognised as male back in 1774,"" Cauchi said. ""He faced a legal battle that involved a medical examination and a ruling by the Grand Master, who allowed him to wear only male clothes.""       Despite welcoming Malta's recent advances in tolerance, she said that ""patriarchal views and structures still persist, and Malta is the only EU country where abortion is illegal"". Grima also offered an honest take. ""To say it's perfect would be untrue. The scale of the EuroPride events attracted criticism and Maltese law does not yet include an Equality Act, which would ban discrimination in the workplace. Unlike most of Europe, both PrEP (the drug taken to prevent HIV infection) and PEP (taken after a possible exposure to HIV infection) are only available at a cost."" But the high ranking and recent progress mean there is much to be excited about for queer visitors. For starters, you can stay at the LGBTQ+-owned boutique hotel Senglea Suites in Birgu – a short and scenic ride on a gondola-style dghajsa from Valletta – or gay-owned Fauzia B&B, located in Hamrun just a few kilometres south-west of the capital. The island's biggest LGBTQ+ club is Michaelangelo in the buzzy nightlife district Paceville. Set over two floors, it's popular with a younger, mostly gay male crowd, while Maori is a relaxed seafront bar hosting fortnightly queer nights. A comprehensive resource when you arrive on the islands is Gaymalta.com, which lists all LGBTQ+ events with a useful map of queer-owned businesses. Try to catch a Lollipop party, which takes place at rotating venues and calls itself ""Malta's favourite queer night out since 2016"" (the next one is a Rio Carnival-themed event on 9 Feb). And for that special meal with your partner, head to the Michelin-starred Noni, which pairs traditional Maltese dishes with contemporary cooking inside a 250-year-old former bakery. Other essential stops on the queer trail include the aforementioned Charles & Ron (the couple married after being together 25 years when Malta brought in civil partnerships in 2014), which is the only LGBTQ+-owned fashion store in Malta; and the quirky Souvenirs That Don't Suck, which has stores in both Sliema and Valletta, selling, among other items, a popular range of queer T-shirts. In the north of the island, the Malta Chocolate Factory hosts LGBTQ meet-ups, while the Rainbow Library, Malta's first LGBTQ+ library, contains around 300 books from queer classics to zines (contact MGRM before you visit). Here, of course, you'll find Saunders' biography.   All in all, it's impressive progress for a country that also happens to be 94% Catholic. ""But without someone like Katya Saunders,"" said Depares, ""the road to awareness would have been much longer."" ---  Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

BBCNews_83,"A Russian man has been named and sanctioned for his role in Australia's worst data breach. The personal information of 9.7m Australians was stolen from the country's largest health insurer, Medibank, in late 2022. Sensitive documents, including abortion records, were then posted online. The cyber sanctions - the first of their kind in Australia - include financial penalties and a travel ban for Aleksandr Ermakov. Little has been made public about Mr Ermakov, but Australian intelligence authorities say he is part of the infamous Russian cyber-crime gang REvil - which has been linked to attacks across Europe, the US and UK.  Announcing the measures on Tuesday, Home Affairs Minister Clare O'Neil described the Medibank hack as ""the single most devastating cyber-attack we have experienced as a nation"". ""Literally millions of people having personal data about themselves, their family members, taken from them and cruelly placed online for others to see,"" she said. ""These people are cowards and scumbags... we'll unveil who you are and we'll make sure you're accountable."" Authorities are still investigating the breach, Ms O'Neil added, and more people may face penalties. It is the first time the government has used cyber sanctions legislation, passed in 2021, which applies financial punishments to people involved in significant online attacks. Australia has faced a string of large data breaches in recent years, but few - if any - have rocked the country like the Medibank hack. The cyber criminals had stolen login details which granted them access to all of Medibank's customer data - including the medical records of everyone from athletes and media figures to the Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. They began posting the data online after the insurer - with the government's support - refused to pay a ransom. They first released a set of files named ""good-list"" and ""naughty-list"" which contained, among other things, people's health claims data - including records of treatment for mental health or addiction - as well as names, addresses, birthdates, and government ID numbers.  Soon after they posted: ""added one more file abortions.csv..."", about some customer's end of pregnancy procedures.  Medibank at the time apologised for what it called the ""malicious weaponisation"" of private information, with CEO David Koczkaro warning that the data release could stop people from seeking medical assistance. Several class actions - which argue the firms should have better protected such sensitive data - have since been launched.

BBCNews_85,"New Polish PM Donald Tusk has laid out his programme for government, promising major change after eight years of nationalist government.   The plans include improving relations with the European Union and pledging to restore the rule of law, the focus of a long-running row with Brussels.  He has promised women better access to legal abortions, despite ideological differences in his coalition.  He also pledged support for Ukraine and to be a strong US and Nato ally. His speech came as the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Poland was violating the rights of same-sex couples by denying them legal recognition and protection. Five same-sex Polish couples brought the case after registry offices refused to hold marriage services for them because the country's constitution states that marriage is a relationship between a man and a woman. The ruling is subject to appeal. The speech came ahead of a vote of confidence in his proposed government, which he later won by 248 votes to 201.  In it, Mr Tusk said an isolated Poland was the greatest danger to the country's security. ""I don't think I need to convince anyone how important the durability of our alliances is, how important the strong position of Poland is, respected in the world and in Europe,"" he said. ""That Poland will regain the position of leader of the European Union."" Mr Tusk, who is a former president of the European Council, said his first foreign trip would be to Brussels, where he would make efforts to unblock more than €35bn (£30.1bn; $37.8bn) in EU recovery funds held up over Brussels' concerns about rule of law.  The European Commission has taken legal action against Poland's previous right-wing Law and Justice (PiS)-led government for introducing reforms that undermined judicial independence. His second trip will be to Tallinn to meet leaders from the Baltic and Nordic states. He said there were different opinions within the coalition, which ranges from agrarian conservatives to the left, about how far to liberalise the almost complete ban on abortion. But he said the government would work so that women have access to legal abortion. He said his government would try to mobilise the West to fight war fatigue to continue to help Ukraine. However, help for Ukraine would not come at the cost of Polish entrepreneurs and farmers, he added. Mr Tusk said uncontrolled migration was a challenge, adding it was possible to construct a policy that would both secure Poland's borders and treat migrants humanely. The PiS government was accused of sanctioning pushbacks against migrants and dozens of people have died trying to cross into Poland from Belarus, NGOs say. The new government will be sworn in by President Andrzej Duda on Wednesday. But the day was marred by an incident in which far-right MP Grzegorz Braun put out candles recently lit on a menorah in the parliament for the Jewish festival of Hanukkah using a fire extinguisher. Mr Braun was thrown out of the building and the case has been referred to the Prosecutor's Office. Parliament officials have halved his salary and suspended his MP's allowance for six months. Mr Tusk described the incident as unacceptable and a disgrace. Mr Braun is a member of the small Confederation party who is known for his extreme views. Confederation has 18 MPs in parliament and is not part of the incoming coalition government.  President Zelensky has said the protests show solidarity between Poland and Ukraine is waning.

BBCNews_86,"The 2024 presidential election promises to be one of the most polarising political contests in living memory. But as the war in Gaza rages, President Joe Biden's strong support of Israel is putting him at odds with some of his key supporters - younger voters.  Abdul Osmanu, 22, is not sure he can cast a ballot for President Joe Biden again. Much of that hesitation, he said, involves the Biden administration's support of Israel as it continues to bombard Gaza.  ""As a lover of peace, a Muslim, and a black man, it's terrible to see the repression of the Palestinians,"" said Mr Osmanu, who was elected to his local town council in 2021. ""It'd be tough for me, in my conscience, to vote for a president aiding and abetting that in many ways.""  The young Connecticut voter told the BBC that he was weighing whether to vote for a third-party candidate or leave his presidential ballot blank in 2024. The decision is difficult, however, as he - and many other young voters - do not want to see Donald Trump elected again. An increasing number of young Democratic voters, like Mr Osmanu, appear to be breaking with President Biden over the issue of Israel and the conflict in Gaza. It is a cause for concern for Democrats, as their opposition to Mr Biden's policies could threaten a key pillar of support that the elder statesman leaned on during the 2020 election. For the past two months, young voters have seen in the news and on social media images of war and destruction from within Gaza. They have followed the death toll as it climbed to over 20,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry. At the same time, they have watched as Mr Biden publicly backed Israel's stated effort to eradicate Hamas after they and allied groups killed 1,200 people in Israel on 7 October. It continues to hold an estimated 100 hostages in Gaza. The BBC reviewed polling research and spoke to six young Democratic voters and organisers from across the US. Data and interviews appear to show a growing sense of political discord among young voters ahead of the 2024 election.  The Biden campaign declined to comment. But registered voters aged 18-29 said they were more likely to support the Palestinian cause over Israel, a recent New York Times/Siena poll suggested. According to the survey, voters aged 18-29 had critical views of Israel and its counteroffensive against Hamas across the board, while older generations had more favourable views of the country. Though a clear majority of registered voters - 57% - disapprove of the way Mr Biden is handling the conflict, young voters have the greatest objections. A total 72% of voters aged 18-29 disapprove of Mr Biden's efforts, the Times/Siena poll indicated. Anna Bosking, a 22-year-old Iowa native, plans to vote for Mr Biden again. But after taking a Middle Eastern politics course at university, speaking to classmates from Gaza and seeing eyewitness accounts on social media, she has become more critical of America's relationship with Israel.  ""Before this conflict I always thought Israel was a consistent ally that we would always support, and I never had any issues,"" she told the BBC. ""But I think the American people have been forced to consider the historical context in the situation.""  One possible reason for the divide is that young Democrats, particularly progressives, are also more likely to connect the cause of Palestinian statehood to the fights for social justice playing out in the US. ""A lot of the organisations that I'm present in have made strong connections to what the Palestinians experience, and want to continue to uplift their struggle,"" said Michael Abramson, the 25-year-old policy director of Young Democrats of Maricopa County in Arizona. Mr Abramson organises in a key Arizona county for Democrats. He said he was confident the youth would turn out in Arizona for other candidates and ballot measures - such as abortion - but he said he was unsure whether he and others would vote for the Democratic nominee, whom he called ""the lesser of two evils"". Democrats relied on young voter turnout  to propel them to victory in the 2020 presidential election and the 2022 midterms. The Democratic apparatus typically pours millions of dollars into youth outreach and engagement to shore up support. And not all young voters criticised Mr Biden's position towards Israel. Jessica Schwab, a 20-year-old student at Columbia University in New York, said she did not want to see Mr Trump re-elected and thought Mr Biden was handling the conflict well. ""He's standing with Israel and providing them with military supplies, and general funding in their defence,"" she said. ""But I do like how he is also asking for humanitarian pauses,  and inserting some sort of breathing room to reduce the amount of casualties that are occurring in Gaza."" Mr Biden's backers also argue that the 2024 election is nearly a year away, and that young Democrats would come back to the fold if presented with a choice between Mr Biden and Mr Trump. ""It's a choice between two candidates,"" said Jack Lobel of the Gen-Z voter advocacy group Voters of Tomorrow. ""And so while President Biden's policies towards Gaza might be upsetting some young people, that's not going to change the fact that he and Donald Trump are two very different people.""

BBCNews_87,"Taylor Swift has capped off a stellar 2023 by being named Time Magazine's person of the year. The star, whose Eras tour broke box office records and provoked an inquiry into Ticketmaster's sales practices, follows the likes of Barack Obama, Greta Thunberg and Volodymyr Zelensky. She told the magazine that she is ""the proudest and happiest I've ever felt"". The award goes to an event or person deemed to have had the most influence on global events over the past year. The singer also admitted to the magazine that the toll of her 180-minute Eras concerts often left her feeling physically exhausted. After a run of shows, ""I do not leave my bed except to get food and take it back to my bed and eat it there,"" she said.  ""I can barely speak because I've been singing for three shows straight. Every time I take a step my feet go crunch, crunch, crunch from dancing in heels.""  The star also talked about her blossoming romance with American Football star Travis Kelce. The couple hit the headlines in September when Swift was spotted at with Kelce's mother at one of his games.  ""By the time I went to that first game, we were a couple,"" she explained, adding they had first hooked up over the summer. ""I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard-launch a first date."" But Swift's love life is small beans compared to her cultural impact. Already a superstar before 2023, her career has reached new heights thanks to the Eras tour - which sees the singer perform a career-spanning 45-song set every night. Demand for tickets was so high that it crashed Ticketmaster's website, prompting a hearing into its business practices by the US Senate. When the tour began in the summer, ticketless fans gathered in car parks just to hear the music. In Seattle, her concerts generated seismic activity equivalent to a 2.3 magnitude earthquake.  ""It feels like the breakthrough moment of my career, happening at 33,"" she told Time. ""And for the first time in my life, I was mentally tough enough to take what comes with that.""  Swift's imperial phase comes after a period where she was vilified for her positions on feminism and politics - although her silence on those issues stemmed from nothing more sinister than a lack of confidence. After speaking out against Donald Trump and in favour of abortion rights, she hit a creative purple patch with the pandemic-era albums Folklore and Evermore. Showcasing a more organic, indie-folk approach than the country-pop that made her famous, the records confirmed her status as a generational songwriting talent. She cemented her comeback with last year's Midnights - a bleary, sleep-deprived collection of pop songs based around the thoughts that keep her up at night. Time editor-in-chief Sam Jacobs said the US pop icon was ""the rare person who is both the writer and hero of her own story"", adding that Swift had ""found a way to transcend borders and be a source of light"". On Monday, Time Magazine announced its shortlist of nine candidates for the title. Those included Chinese President Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, Barbie and the striking Hollywood actors and writers. As well as her tour, Swift has also released the biggest-selling record of 2023 - a re-recording of her decade-old album 1989.  Incredibly, she also has the second and third biggest-sellers of the year in America, with Midnights and Speak Now (Taylor's Version) eclipsing records by Drake, Olivia Rodrigo and Ed Sheeran. Amongst her other achievements this year: Last month, the star was declared a billionaire by business publication Bloomberg, which estimated her net worth to be $1.1bn (£907m). Only three other musicians have achieved billionaire status - Rihanna, Beyoncé and Jay-Z.  However, Swift is the first to reach the milestone based on music alone, as her rivals' fortunes incorporate business ventures in fashion, beauty products and hi-fi equipment. In a social media post, Swift celebrated her latest accolade by turning the spotlight on her beloved cat, Benjamin - who appeared draped around her shoulders on Time Magazine's cover. Swift is currently on a break before launching the Asian and Australian legs of her Eras tour in February. The shows come to Europe in May, and Swift is also expected to release a re-recorded version of her Reputation album in the new year. Her decision to re-make all of her first six albums came after her old record label, Big Machine, sold her master tapes to music mogul Scooter Braun in 2019. He later sold them to an investment company. Speaking to Time, she said she had initially recoiled at the idea, which had been suggested by both her father and fellow pop star Kelly Clarkson. ""I'd look at them and go, 'How can I possibly do that?' Nobody wants to redo their homework if on the way to school, the wind blows your book report away.""  In the end, she went ahead with the project as an act of rebellion. ""It's all in how you deal with loss,"" she says. ""I respond to extreme pain with defiance."" The pop star talks about her sex-positive EP, and why artists need to take a stand over royalties. Festival organisers say they won't host the 2024 event to allow it to ""flourish and evolve"". The presenter is taking over from DJ Ace, who left the the station after 21 years. Jan Latham-Koenig was caught out in an operation involving a police officer posing as a child. Israel's song is alleged to have references to last year's Hamas attacks, breaking neutrality rules. Copyright 2024 BBC.

BBCNews_88,"Amy and Ano are identical twins, but just after they were born they were taken from their mother and sold to separate families. Years later, they discovered each other by chance thanks to a TV talent show and a TikTok video. As they delved into their past, they realised they were among thousands of babies in Georgia stolen from hospitals and sold, some as recently as 2005. Now they want answers.  Amy is pacing up and down in a hotel room in Leipzig. ""I'm scared, really scared,"" she says, fidgeting nervously. ""I haven't slept all week. This is my chance to finally get some answers about what happened to us."" Her twin sister, Ano, sits in an armchair, watching TikTok videos on her phone. ""This is the woman that could have sold us,"" she says, rolling her eyes.  Ano admits she is nervous too, but only because she doesn't know how she will react and if she will be able to control her anger. It's the end of a long journey. They have travelled from Georgia to Germany, in the hope of finding the missing piece of the puzzle. They are finally meeting their birth mother.  For the past two years they have been building a picture of what happened. As they unravelled the truth, they realised there were tens of thousands of other people in Georgia who had also been taken from hospitals as babies and sold over the decades. Despite official attempts to investigate what happened, nobody has been held to account yet.   The story of how Amy and Ano discovered each other starts when they were 12. Amy Khvitia was at her godmother's house near the Black Sea watching her favourite TV programme, Georgia's Got Talent. There was a girl dancing the jive who looked exactly like her. Not just like her, in fact, identical. ""Everyone was calling my mum and asking: 'Why is Amy dancing under another name?'"" she says. Amy mentioned it to her family but they brushed it off. ""Everyone has a doppelganger,"" her mother said.   Seven years later, in November 2021, Amy posted a video of herself with blue hair getting her eyebrow pierced on TikTok.   Two hundred miles (320km) away in Tbilisi, another 19-year-old, Ano Sartania, was sent the video by a friend. She thought it was ""cool that she looks like me"".  Ano tried to trace the girl with the pierced eyebrow online but couldn't find her, so she shared the video on a university WhatsApp group to see if anyone could help. Someone who knew Amy saw the message and connected them on Facebook.  Amy instantly knew Ano was the girl she had seen all those years ago on Georgia's Got Talent. ""I have been looking for you for so long!"" she messaged. ""Me too,"" replied Ano.  Over the next few days, they discovered they had a lot in common, but not all of it made sense.  They were both born in Kirtskhi maternity hospital - which no longer exists -  in western Georgia but, according to their birth certificates, their birthdays were a couple of weeks apart.  They couldn't be sisters, much less twins. But there were too many similarities. They liked the same music, they both loved dancing and even had the same hairstyle. They discovered they had the same genetic disease, a bone disorder called dysplasia. It felt like they were unravelling a mystery together. ""Every time I learned something new about Ano, things got stranger,"" says Amy. They arranged to meet and a week later, as Amy approached the top of the escalator at Rustaveli metro station in Tbilisi, she and Ano saw each other in the flesh for the very first time. ""It was like looking in a mirror, the exact same face, exact same voice. I am her and she is me,"" says Amy. She knew then that they were twins. ""I don't like hugs, but I hugged her,"" says Ano.  They decided to confront their families and for the first time they learned the truth. They had been adopted, separately, a few weeks apart in 2002.  Amy was upset and felt her whole life had been a lie. Dressed head to toe in black she looks tough, but she fiddles with her studded choker nervously and wipes a mascara-stained tear away from her cheek. ""It's a crazy story,"" she says. ""But it's true.""  Ano was ""angry and upset with my family, but I just wanted the difficult conversations to be over so that we could all move on"".  Digging deeper, the twins found the details on their official birth certificates, including the date they were born, were wrong.  Unable to have children, Amy's mother says a friend told her there was an unwanted baby at the local hospital. She would need to pay the doctors but she could take her home and raise her as her own. Ano's mother was told the same story.  Neither of the adoptive families knew the girls were twins and despite paying a lot of money to adopt their daughters, they say they hadn't realised it was illegal. Georgia was going through a period of turmoil and as hospital staff were involved they thought it was legitimate. Neither family would reveal how much money was exchanged. The twins couldn't help wondering if their biological parents had sold them for profit. Amy wanted to search for their birth mother to find out, but Ano wasn't sure. ""Why do you want to meet the person that could have betrayed us?"" she asked.   Amy found a Facebook group dedicated to reuniting Georgian families with children suspected to have been illegally adopted at birth and she shared their story. A young woman in Germany replied, saying her mother had given birth to twin girls in Kirtskhi Maternity Hospital in 2002 and that despite being told they had died, she now had some doubts.    DNA tests revealed that the girl from the Facebook group was their sister, and was living with their birth mother, Aza, in Germany.   Amy was desperate to meet Aza, but Ano was more sceptical. ""This is the person who could have sold you, she's not going to tell you the truth,"" she warned. Even so she agreed to go to Germany with Amy to support her.  The Facebook group the twins had used, Vedzeb, means ""I'm searching"" in Georgian. It has countless posts from mothers who say hospital staff told them their babies had died, but later discovered the deaths weren't recorded and their children could still be alive.  Other posts are from children like Amy and Ano, looking for their birth parents.  The group has more than 230,000 members and, along with access to DNA websites, has blown wide open a dark chapter in Georgia's history.  It was set up by journalist Tamuna Museridze in 2021 after she discovered she was adopted. She found her birth certificate with incorrect details when she was clearing out her late mother's house.  She started the group to search for her own family, but the group has ended up exposing a baby trafficking scandal affecting tens of thousands of people, and spanning decades. She has helped to reunite hundreds of families, but has not yet tracked down her own.  Tamuna discovered a black market in adoption that stretched across Georgia and went on from the early 1950s to 2005.  She believes it was run by organised criminals and involved people from all sections of society, from taxi drivers to people high up in the government. Corrupt officials would fake the documents needed for the illegal adoptions. ""The scale is unimaginable, up to 100,000 babies were stolen. It was systemic,"" she says.  Tamuna explains that she calculated this figure by counting the number of people who have contacted her and combining that with the time frame and the nationwide spread of cases.  With a lack of access to documents - some have been lost and others aren't being released - it is impossible to verify the exact figure.  Tamuna says many parents told her that when they asked to see the bodies of their dead babies they were told they had already been buried in the hospital grounds. She has since learned that cemeteries at Georgian hospitals never existed. In other cases parents would be shown dead babies who had been frozen in the mortuary.  Tamuna says it was expensive to buy a child, about the equivalent of a year's salary. She discovered that some children ended up with foreign families in the US, Canada, Cyprus, Russia and Ukraine. In 2006 Georgia strengthened its anti-trafficking laws and in 2007 it changed its adoption legislation, making illegal adoptions more difficult. Another person looking for answers is Irina Otarashvili. She gave birth to twin boys in a maternity hospital in Kvareli, in the foothills of Georgia's Caucasus mountains in 1978.   The doctors told her both boys were healthy but, for reasons that were never explained, they were kept away from her. Three days after they were born, she was told they had both suddenly died. A doctor said they had respiratory problems.  Irina and her husband couldn't make sense of it, but especially in Soviet times ""you didn't question authority"" she says. She believed everything they said. They were asked to bring a suitcase to take the infants' remains away and to bury it in a cemetery or their back garden, as was common for babies at the time. The doctor told them never to open the case as it would be too upsetting to see the bodies.  Irina did as she was told, but 44 years later her daughter Nino found Tamuna's Facebook group and grew suspicious.  ""What if our brothers didn't really die?"" she wondered. Nino and her sister Nana decided to dig up the suitcase. ""My heart was racing,"" she says. ""When we opened it there were no bones, just sticks. We didn't know whether to laugh or cry."" She says local police confirmed the contents were branches from a grape vine and there was no trace of human remains. She now believes her long-lost brothers could still be alive.   In the hotel in Leipzig, Amy and Ano prepare to meet their birth mother. Ano says she's changed her mind and wants to back out. But it's a momentary wobble and, taking a deep breath, she decides to go ahead.   Their biological mother, Aza, waits nervously in another room. Amy opens the door hesitantly and Ano follows, almost pushing her sister into the room. Aza lunges forward and embraces them tightly, one twin on each side. Minutes pass and locked in embrace, no-one speaks.  Tears stream down Amy's face but Ano remains stoic and unwavering. She even looks a little irritated. The three of them sit down to talk in private. Later, the twins say that their mother explained she had been ill after giving birth and fell into a coma. When she awoke, hospital staff told her that shortly after the babies were born, they had died.  She said that meeting Amy and Ano has given her life new meaning. Although they are not close, they are still in touch. In 2022, the Georgian government launched an investigation into historic child trafficking. It told the BBC it has spoken to more than 40 people but the cases were ""very old and historic data has been lost"". Journalist Tamuna Museridze says she has shared information but the government hasn't said when it will release its report.  It has made at least four attempts to get to the bottom of what happened. These include an investigation in 2003 into international child trafficking which led to a number of  arrests but little information has been made public. And in 2015, after another investigation, Georgian media reported that the general director of the Rustavi maternity hospital, Aleksandre Baravkovi, was arrested but cleared and returned to work.   The BBC approached the Georgian Interior Ministry for further information on individual cases but we were told that specific details would not be released due to data protection. Tamuna has now joined forces with human rights lawyer Lia Mukhashavria to take the cases of a group of victims to the Georgian courts. They want the right to access their birth documents - something not currently possible under Georgian law. They hope that this will help lay ghosts to rest. ""I always felt like there was something or someone missing in my life,"" says Ano. ""I used to dream about a little girl in black who would follow me around and ask me about my day."" That feeling disappeared when she found Amy. Georgia's Stolen Children Watch more on this story on the BBC iPlayer.  (UK only) You can also see more on YouTube.

BBCNews_89,"Argentines have elected far-right outsider Javier Milei, 53, as their new president. With almost all votes counted, Mr Milei had won close to 56% in the decisive run-off, ahead of his left-wing rival, Sergio Massa, with 44%. The radical newcomer's victory has been described as ""a political earthquake"". It has been welcomed by like-minded politicians such as US ex-President Donald Trump, who said Mr Milei would ""Make Argentina Great Again"". Brazil's former leader Jair Bolsonaro said that ""hope would shine again in South America"".  Sometimes dubbed ""El Loco"" (the madman) by his critics, Mr Milei has promised drastic changes, which include ditching the local currency, the peso, for the US dollar and ""blowing up"" the central bank in order to prevent it from printing more money, which he argues is driving inflation.  He has also proposed cutting welfare payments and slashing bureaucracy by closing the ministries of culture, women, health and education, among others.  In a round of media interviews following his election win, he said he would privatise Argentina's state energy company, YPF, and the country's public broadcasters. ""Everything than can be [put] into the hands of the private sector, will be in the hands of the private sector,"" he said. However, Mr Milei added that before YPF could be privatised, it would have to be ""rebuilt"". He did not say how long that process could take.  The president-elect also announced that public works would be ""cut down to zero"" and those already in progress would be put out to tender so that ""there would be no more state spending"". On social issues, he wants to loosen gun laws, abolish abortion - which was legalised in Argentina in 2020 - and allow the sale and purchase of human organs.  Mr Milei's victory comes amid a deep economic crisis which has seen annual inflation rise to 143% and 40% of Argentines living in poverty. While opinion polls conducted before the election had given Mr Milei a slight lead over Mr Massa, the wide margin of his win - by more than 11% according to provisional results - has surprised many.  Mr Massa, who is the economy minister in the outgoing left-wing government, quickly conceded defeat saying that ""obviously the results are not what we had hoped for"". Analysts say Mr Milei's aggressive style and his promise to ""do away with the political caste"", which he blames for the country's ills, appealed to voters who were fed up with Argentina's established parties. ""This model of decadence has come to an end. There is no turning back,"" he told his supporters in his victory speech, promising a new era for Argentina. ""From being the richest country in the world, today we are (ranked) 130. Half of Argentines are poor and the other 10% are destitute. Stop this impoverishing model of the caste. Today we embrace the Libertarian model so as to return to being a global power,"" he said. He also announced that the changes he would bring in would be drastic and immediate.  During campaigning, the former economist and pundit held a chainsaw aloft to symbolise plans to cut spending. His message appeared to resonate with voters celebrating his win in the streets of Buenos Aires. One woman told AFP news agency that ""we were very tired, we wanted to renew, we wanted to see new faces, always the same ones, I bet on change, on Milei, that it will go well for him, it will go well for the country"". However, economists have been more circumspect, pointing out that Mr Milei's party only holds a small number of seats in Argentina's Congress and that he will therefore have to negotiate with the very politicians he disparaged and attacked during the campaign. Despite his anti-establishment rhetoric, Mr Milei has in the past been quick to bury the hatchet if it suits him politically.  Following his win in the first round, he stopped attacking the third-placed candidate, conservative Patricia Bullrich, who in turn threw her weight behind Mr Milei in the second round.  In his victory speech, he thanked both Ms Bullrich and the conservative former president, Mauricio Macri, who had also endorsed him.  But while his supporters took to the streets of the capital, Buenos Aires, chanting ""change!"", there are also those who worry about what Mr Milei's victory may mean for Argentine society. His choice of Victoria Villarruel as his vice-presidential running mate shocked human rights campaigners in the country, in which 30,000 people were killed or forcibly disappeared under military rule from 1976 to 1983. Ms Villarruel, who comes from a military family, has defended officers convicted of crimes against humanity and proposed dismantling a museum which commemorates victims of Argentina's military junta.  Mr Milei and Ms Villarruel will be sworn in on 10 December for a four-year term.  Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox. Copyright 2024 BBC.
