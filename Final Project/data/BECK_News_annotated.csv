BECKNews_1," Election night 2023 didn't go as planned for many Republicans. In Ohio, voters enshrined abortion rights into their state constitution and legalized recreational marijuana. And Virginia voters handed Democrats full control of their state's congress. So what happened? Glenn and Stu give their take. But it wasn't all losses for conservatives. Glenn speaks with Dom Theodore, program director for The Glenn Beck Program, about an amazing victory in Michigan against an out-of-control township board.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors All right. Do we have Dom on? Dom Theodore. He's the program director of this program. He's actually the guy who saved my career about 20 years ago. And told me, what are you doing, listening to everybody else?Your show sucks when you listen to everybody else.Why don't you do what you want to do. And I was like, you know, I will try that because they will fire me anyway.And now here we are, all these many years later. Dom, how you are?DOM: I say it worked out for you, pretty well.GLENN: Yeah. It did. It did. So, Dom, let's talk about what happened in Michigan last night.Something miraculous happened in your township.DOM: Yeah. It's really one township over from where I live.And I think this audience is -- it's the DCP-run Goshen battery factory. That the state of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer tried to shove down our throat locally. And continues to, by the way.But what's happened, there were a number of local officials, that early on, kind of signed on to that project in a shroud of secrecy. They used secret code names for it. Like project elephant. And they kept the community in the dark. Well, the community eventually found out about it. But, of course, by that point, after the board had committed resources. And taken votes.And, you know, supported Goshen.And it was really too late for the public to respond.And so the public went into action.And signed recall petitions for all the board members for green charter township.Eventually, a couple of them had resigned. So there were only five left, that didn't resign.And last night, every single one of them was replaced. And the recall election. We clean swept all five of those seats.In addition there was another seat for the township supervisor, in Big Rapids Township, unlike the green charter township board, the Big Rapids Township listened to the public.And everyone except their supervisor, Bill Stanik, had decided to go with what the public had -- had wanted. Which was not supporting Goshen. The only one that wouldn't change his mind was Bill Stanik.He also was recalled last night, and replaced.GLENN: So what does this mean?Because you have a Chinese communist company, coming in here, to build batteries. It's -- it has in its charter, that it has to have, you know, a young communist club.And all kinds of crazy stuff. But Whitmer brought all of this stuff in. Jammed it through. The town councils. They all said, okay. So is this going to stop it?Or -- or -- or what is this?DOM: Here's the worst part, they did all this without tax dollars. That's the thing. The money that lured them here. And is paying for most of this, is Michigan tax dollars. So, so that's the worst part.There's a development agreement in place that the previous board left over. And obviously, the new board is going to look at that. With -- with an attorney. And see what the options are, as far as getting out of it.There are a number of things that Goshen in the past, has basically been able to come in and steamroll over the community. And against the public's wishes.You know, it's interesting, the former township supervisor, Jim Chapman, completely refused to take a public survey at any point. Because he knew that this would be the result. And, by the way, Glenn, the margins weren't even close. We won by 70 percent in most cases.GLENN: Jeez.DOM: It's clear the community didn't want this project. Never wanted this project. And now we have a board with fresh eyes, as you said. That will look at every option on the table. And see how they can get out of the development agreement. And possibly some other remedies as well.But what they're going to find now, the township boards are not going to roll over like they had been.GLENN: Good. Good.Well, congratulations, Dom. I know you guys have worked really hard on this.And standing up to not only Whitmer and all the state's machinery. Also the machinery of the CCP is not easy. And here's good guys winning. Keep it up.DOM: It wasn't me. There were so many people involved in the community. All came together.And we can use everyone's help. And ProtectMecosta.org, because there's still -- there's actually a lawsuit as well, to try to stop them.So there's a C3, you know, nonprofit set up, to help tax deductible donations at Protect Mecosta, as in Mecosta County, M-E-C-O-S-T-A, dot-org, if people would like to donate.GLENN: Thank you very much. Appreciate. God bless.So that's some good news.Some good news, taxpayers went and said, no to higher taxes. All over the country.If I were not the guy that I am, and, you know, hadn't done my homework. Wasn't paying attention in Ohio.I would have voted against -- or for the -- the abortion proposition. Because to me, the way it was worded, is so misleading.It was, you know, the -- the state is going to be able to have. It will be in the Constitution. Somebody can get in the way of your wife's miscarriage. You know, and have to manage that for her.What are you talking about?It was horrible, the way it was worded. And I think there were a lot of people that fell for it, quite honestly.It wasn't honest. However, it could be that people just are cool with abortion. I don't know.I don't know.STU: And if that's the case, then we are going to deserve everything our country gets. You know, that is where this is going to end sadly.But you're right, the wording was completely ridiculous. Bringing up things like birth control. Which no one was fighting against.Fertility treatments, which no one was fighting against. Miscarriage care, which nobody was fighting against.There was one really interesting -- I can't remember the exact wording of it. But the right to be able to keep your own pregnancy. Which, is there a movement of people just walking out of the street, pointing at pregnant bellies and saying, end that one. I don't know. Maybe there is.GLENN: Never. I've never seen it.STU: I've never heard it. I've never heard it.GLENN: So now in the Constitution is the right to abortion. And another measure that they voted for, to legalize marijuana. Margins on both ballot measures, not even close. Abortion and marijuana both won by double digits. Congratulations.STU: By the way, totally expected. Not a surprise at all. It was something we talked about yesterday, that was going to happen. It's unfortunate. And now Ohio is basically California on abortion. And I know, look, while some people are --GLENN: Some are not for the -- the constitutional vote over the summer.STU: That was the vote that mattered. We knew this would happen once the first one happened. Look, if -- there are people that are certainly to the left of us. When it comes to the life issue. And maybe the people of Ohio are in that category. But they're not as far left as California and New York and Illinois, and now they have the same loss. And it's constitutionally enshrined.So it will be hard to remove. But that is what this is all about. The point is changing people's minds over a long period of time.It won't always be done with the law. You can't just depend on votes. You have to be able to convince people over a very long period.It's important. Because what we're talking about is children living.And I know it's a quaint, little idea, that we shouldn't be talking about anymore. But we kind of think the children should be alive.GLENN: Looks like the Democratic Party held on to the governor's mansion in Kentucky. The Senate in Virginia.They managed to flip the Virginia House.The biggest win came in two ballot measures in Ohio. We just told you about.One race in the Virginia house was really close. And I don't have -- can you see if they've called this race yet?Susanna Gibson. Did it go to Susanna Gibson. Or did it go to David Owens. It was too close to call in the middle of the night.But Susanna Gibson, if you remember, was the nurse practitioner, who people talked about because she made videos of her performing all kinds of things by request for payment.In her bedroom.STU: It appears that Owen did win that race.GLENN: Owen did win it. Not the her.STU: And probably the porn issue is a difference here.It's only about a 3 percent race. About 900 votes, give or take.It was the difference in this race. So probably, I don't know, maybe -- maybe she will lose by 20 points. The porn thing got her close. My guess was, the difference was, this scandal that came out.GLENN: You have the Mississippi governor, Tate Reeves. The second term for of him. The Democrat conceded last night.The assembly in New Jersey remains solidly blue. It was a democratic clean sweep. Long Island goes Republican, so we got Long Island.Colorado voters rejected property tax measures backed by the Democrats.In Maine, they voted against a new state utility. And they said, they wanted to change their Constitution. And put it -- remains in the Constitution, but for some unknown reason, at least to me. They took it out of the printed Constitution.And it's all of the tribal obligations.That Maine has. That, you know, 200 years ago, they made to the Native Americans. And the people there.But it's full of white people. So you would expect this.STU: Oh.GLENN: They said, hey, we should put that back in our Constitution. So we all remember what we -- where we came from.And our obligations.So those racists up in Maine, they voted to restore that.STU: White people are the worst. Am I right?GLENN: No.Whitmer and Jackson Lee. Okay. So here it is.It's Whitmire, actually. It's senator John Whitmire, running for the mayor's role in Houston. Running against Sheila Jackson Lee.STU: Exciting. Exciting race. They will go to runoff there.GLENN: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.GLENN: So you're going to have one of the two.You know --STU: Yeah. Whitmer would probably be the better one.GLENN: Over Sheila Jackson Lee?STU: Yes.GLENN: Just for comedic -- just for comedic purposes.STU: That's true. We don't live in Houston.So for our purposes, Sheila Jackson Lee would be a better mayor.Because we would get constant --GLENN: I cannot believe that Sheila Jackson Lee is actually being considered by a good number of people in Houston. That's insanity. All of this. All of this, just goes to show you, that we are not a nation.You know, it's not an open-and-shut case.Everyone knows it will be close. But I don't think that it is actually running in our favor.When comes to -- you know, the poll numbers.I don't think -- I mean, I don't think this is an open-and-shut case. By any stretch of the imagination.STU: In what way?GLENN: For any of these presidential candidates.STU: I think that's definitely true. It's not easy to win presidential elections. Now, you do have a very, very weak candidate running for reelection. At least currently in Joe Biden.Which makes it possible for --GLENN: Possible.STU: But it's not obvious by any means.And I was looking at the Texas results. And he this voted on -- voted here in Texas. Fourteen different propositions.Only one did they reject.They said yes to all 14 of them, except one. And that that one was raising the mandatory requirement age for state judges.So the -- the state Constitution would be amended to increase the mandatory retirement age. From Texas judges from 279 to 75. So the one thing they rejected from all of these. Like creating funds for water.And creating funds for internet.And all these other things. The only other thing that Texas projected. Was no more old people. Please. No more old people.   The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy people on the left. The AOC's have taken over, places in the media.And places like this in New York.This is what it is thousand. So there's been one case. One. One in the entire seven years. Where they did this.Where they shut down a company, that had no obvious victims.The case was 1972.And it was a company, relatively small company, that was writing term papers, for college students. Okay.So I want to write my paper.GLENN: I want to break out in God bless America.STU: Capitalism is pretty impressive. Apparently, this didn't go over that well.What they said, there were no obvious victims here. The people bought the term papers. They didn't want to write them. They got the term papers. They said, they were defrauding the education system.GLENN: Which they were.STU: This is the one time. And it's a small tiny company. Let me give you the other times they've done this.Tell me if any of these sound like, hey, I have a good interest rate, on a loan I paid back.Number one, a breast cancer nonprofit was shut down a do",-2,,-3
BECKNews_2," Former president Donald Trump's interviews with Megyn Kelly and NBC News turned a lot of heads over the weekend. On NBC News, Trump condemned fellow presidential candidate Gov. Ron DeSantis' Florida heartbeat bill as a ""terrible mistake,"" while also supporting some limits on abortion. And on The Megyn Kelly Show, he addressed the growing transgender trend and whether or not men can become women. @MegynKelly joins Glenn to discuss how Trump's answers may affect his 2024 campaign, whether he's already looking ahead to the general election and trying to appeal to independents, and whether this strategy will work. Plus, they discuss whether President Biden will be the Democratic 2024 candidate, or if the Left is already trying to oust him: ""You can feel the ground shifting.""    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Hello, Megyn, how are you?MEGYN: Hi, I'm well. How are you doing? GLENN: I'm very good. So your interview, and the interview that the president did on MSNBC are getting a lot of play over the weekend. Because in some -- in some places, he seemed to be hedging his bet. And on MSNBC,he talked about a 15-week limit on abortions.MEGYN: Yeah. Well, he -- this is one of the reasons why President Trump needs to put himself out there more.Because just like president HEP it's not okay for either one of these leading candidates on the Dem or the GOP side stay underground. So to his credit, Trump is putting himself out there. Much more than Joe Biden.But we absolutely need to be probing their positions, as the American public tries to make a decision.And Trump on the social issue, with all due credit for the Supreme Court justices he got has always been a little wishy-washy.He lived pretty much 75 easier. Seventy-three. Whatever it is, before he became president.As a Democrat. You know, one of my debate questions for him back in 2017, was when do you become a Republican?If you look back, he's been much, much of a Democrat. And more liberal on social issues. Like virtually everyone in New York is.And I think there's a fair amount of that in him.GLENN: So is this -- for instance, let me play a clip you with. Where he was talking about, can a man become pregnant?Play it.VOICE: Can a man become a woman?DONALD: In my opinion, can a man become a woman. I think -- I think part of it is birth. Can the man give birth? No. No. Although, they'll come up with some answer to that also.I heard just the other day, they have a way that now the man can give birth. No. I would say that I'm continuing my stance on that.GLENN: So what did -- what was your takeaway? Because he never really answered it. But he did shake his head no. Towards the beginning.What's your takeaway from that?MEGYN: Well, I thought it was weak sauce. I really wish he -- he did better on that. I like Ron DeSantis' answer, I'll be honest.Which is no. No. No.Obviously no.GLENN: Right.TOM: And it's not determined based on who can give birth. It's determined by God.And it's pretty obvious, just as soon as you come out of the womb. That's the way -- that's the way he seems to not being painting this weird agenda by some activist in this crazy trans agenda-pushing cult.So Trump clearly knows that. I don't know if he has -- maybe trying to appease some group of trans voters. That he thinks will make the difference with him.Even when I had Don Jr on my show, he was kind of dancing around this issue.I -- I think that they think, they somehow will do better with Democrats. If they don't hit this straight-on.Even though, I mean, 98 percent of the Republican Party is united on this issue.This is not a winner for any Republican to hedge on this.Just ask Asa Hutchinson. So I'm not sure what he's thinking. I feel like this, and the abortion thing. He must be thinking more general elections, where there are Democrats, who don't feel as Republicans do.But I really think, there's a small voting group on this particular issue, he needs a better answer. And I hope he gets it.GLENN: So do you think this will shape the tree at all?I mean, I think he looks at the poll numbers. And thinks theres -- I mean, I'm going to win. So why not start a moderate campaign now?Because I'm going to win the -- the primary.So let's just get past that. And start being, you know, more moderate to appeal to a wider audience. Than just the Republicans. You think that will work?MEGYN: I don't. I mean, I'm in much more of the Ann Coulter thinking, it comes to who the party should nominate.I think they should nominate someone who will drive turnout. And generally with Republicans, that means someone who is conservative. Who is genuinely conservative.Look what happened with John McCain. Okay? They've tried to go more moderate.It doesn't work. Now, Trump does tracking turnout. Because he's Trump. And there's something about that. His constituency finds more appealing. And, you know, that 30 percent, isn't going to abandon him. Even if it comes out with abortion in the 9th month, I mean, that's a really -- that's really the question. Not whether he can choose something on HEP Fifth Avenue. For Trump to say, he's preabortion, ninth month. And still hold on to that four, 30 percent. Glenn, I think the answer is yes.And he's almost toying with that experiment right now. He's now pro abortion. He's really more banking on the fact, that he appointed the three justices, and made a difference on Roe v. Wade. And he won't lose any Republican voters to Joe Biden, on the issue of abortion. Right?He's playing the long game. But he does need to generate enthusiasm. And he's already tamped down. Not in the first set of Republicans. But in the other half, who are tepid on Trump.GLENN: So let me ask you about Joe Biden here for a second.Because I've started to see, for instance, there's an article in the Washington Post, from a big -- a big player. On the left. And in the editorial, he said, you know, I love Joe Biden. And he's done great things.And nothing against anything he's ever done. But I think it's time for him to go.And I think that you see the supporters, and the -- the key members, possibly starting to move in and saying, you know, Joe, I think maybe you should go.Do you think that he is the candidate? By the time we get to the -- the election.MEGYN: I don't know, Glenn. I'm seeing what you're seeing.It seems like there's a movement underfoot to gently oust him and her. That's what was interesting about it. In wacko.Which is, we don't want to be stuck with her.But, you know, live by the sword, die by the sword.They selected her for identity politics reasons, and good luck subbing her out. And subbing in some other person, like Gavin Newsom. You know, who doesn't check the right boxes. And even who does check the right boxes, Sunny Hopkins, woke identity politics warrior on The View was saying. If he subs out Kamala Harris, he will lose the black vote. We're not interchangeable, even if he puts back in a black woman.Anyway, you can feel the ground shifting.CNN is doing a long fact-check on Biden. I, last Thursday, have never seen them unleash their Daniel Gale HEP guy on Biden. That was always a Trump thing.Now more and more sort of getting interested in just how old President Biden is. And polling heavily on that.The results are disastrous. The nation's piece. There's been example after example of how they seem to be realize with whom, you know what, he can't do it. (?) we're going to lose, if we stick with him.But I also think, you have to ask revelings, how do you get rid of it?You know, I think there's some fantasy that Barack Obama can do it. You know, give the tap on the shoulder. Like you get at the dance. Time to sit down. Your dancing is over.I'm not sure.GLENN: Well, it's exact --MEGYN: What man voluntarily walks away from power like that?GLENN: Well, voluntarily, George Washington. But remember that Nixon did that.and Nixon only did it,when he realized, the party (?) was no longer with him.When all of the people he counted acon, to help support him, were turning on him.And that's when he decided to resign. There's a good way to do this.And there's the tough way. And we're offering you the chance to make this your idea.And what -- I think part of the pressure, might be the Hunter Biden scandal.When you saw the -- the charges, last week.Are these real, or are these bogus too?MEGYN: The gun charges? Oops, I mean, they are real. (?) and any of us would have been charged with it. So okay.But, of course, they were brought very reluctantly, by a guy who is on his side.David Weiss, the US attorney for tell wear. Is on hunter apps side. (?) for six years.Who let the MS damning charges might do the statute of limitations.(?) even though hunter's lawyers offered what's called a toggle agreement. They offered to extend the statute of limitations. And tasted Weiss said, no. That's okay.This is his prosecutor, so we're supposed to believe he's going to be tough on Hunter. BS. It was a figure life charge on only (?) a lot of people think, won't even hold you up. This gun statute has been deemed unconstitutional under the Second Amendment. So it's possible they can go in. (?) to most Republicans.But kind of a low stakes matter.Let's say. Let's say he gets convicted. Which he probably will. Some are saying, this is a smart move by the Republicans.Because at least now, Unterand Joe have real skin in the game.He could potentially face real jail time.And maybe it gives (?) power of just a moment ago gibel for Hunter. (?) you'll pardon him. While announcing you're just a one-termer.You can give your son a apart. Keep him out of jail. Save the Democratic Party. You'll be on Mount Rushmore. (?), you know what, if that's the price it takes to get him out of this. Let's do it.(laughter)GLENN: So be as tough on this as you can be.When you see the left saying, there's no evidence. There's no evidence.They've got no evidence.There's plenty of evidence. I don't know if that all adds up to, you know, proof.But there's tons of evidence. If you are standing in a court of law.Because that's what is what you used to do. And your client was Joe Biden. And Hunter Biden.And you saw the evidence that the prosecution has shown already. And they say there's more. How would you assess your chance of winning?MEGYN: It would just depend on the he have dentiary (?) 51 percent more likely. And 49 percent are not.He's guilty. If it's I don't understand a reasonable doubt, I would acquit him. So far. So far.That's only because we haven't gotten all the bank records. Which they're about to get. It's more than 51 percent likely he did this.I would put him more up in the '60s. If you're talking about conviction of a crime. Not there yet.GLENN: Yeah. And what do the bank records. What are you looking for, in the bank records. What do they have to show?MEGYN: Well, I would want to see the actual deposits of men. In Joe Biden's numerically convict him of a cranium. (?), but we have Peter Schweizer on the show on Friday. He, of course, is a Hunter expert.He makes interesting points about how -- in order to show bribery. In order to show corruption, you don't need it show any (?) showing the deposits into Hunter Biden's account is enough. Not to mention the other eight family members on the tape.GLENN: Correct. Correct.MEGYN: The benefit the to the family member is sufficient.This (?) kind of brings me back to the (?) I almost feel like, Republicans are overstating their own burden.You know, it's -- it doesn't need -- I realize why they're doing the impeachment. I'm actually in favor of it. But it doesn't need to go that route.And they don't need to allege crimes. The corruption is there, plane as the nose on your face. I want (?) one -- one honest journalist, just one. With access to President Biden.To get him in an interview, and say, how dare you allow your son, to sit on the board of Burisma.Ukraine and company, being investigated for corruption. When you were the point man on the Obama bludgeon cleanlyup in Ukraine.How dare you.Is that not disqualifying to your ongoing role as public official? Go ahead.GLENN: I think it is.We're not going to see that. But I think it is. I would love to see that.I would go a step further. As a father, you knew who Kolomoisky was.He's a brutal killer. Beheads his opponents.And you took your son -- you knew had a drug problem. And drinking problem.And could easily be roped into anything.And you allowed him to sit on -- on that board, with that man?Are you out of your mind?MEGYN: Right. When he was drug addled. Looking back on the time line of hunter's addiction.I actually (?) in preparation for my show today.So he joined the board of Burisma in April 2014.That same year, he was discharged from the Navy reserve, after testing positive for cocaine right? That same year, when he joined the boards. Which Joe knows all of this. This is while his father was overseeing US politics in Ukraine.By May of 15th, he had a relapse of his alcohol attack. By 2016, he had a relapse of his crack cocaine addiction.And this is all while he's doing business with -- with the Chinese in these while he's on the board of Burisma.GLENN: Jeez.MEGYN: Which his father knows, because he's religion calling into the hunter business meetings.He knows, his crack addled son is sitting on the board, cashing checks. And he's just (?) facilitating it. I mean, at a minimum, this counteracts the narrative of, what a great dad he is.GLENN: I agree. I agree.Megyn, thank you very much. We look forward to your program.You can catch Megyn Kelly, wherever you get your podcast.She also follows this show on Sirius XM. Thank you so much.MEGYN: Thank you, Glenn.    The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that.

BECKNews_3,"WRITER  **DISCLAIMER: PreBorn is a paying sponsor of the Glenn Beck Program** If you have been listening to the Glenn Beck Program, you likely have heard Glenn talk about one of the show's sponsors, PreBorn, a pro-life organization that ""supports life-affirming Pregnancy Clinics in their mission to reach women considering abortion."" In the first half of 2023 alone, PreBorn has saved 28,000 babies from being aborted by providing services like free ultrasounds and provisions for mothers up to two years after their baby is born. See on Instagram Glenn often calls on his audience to consider donating $28 to PreBorn, the cost of giving a free ultrasound to an expecting mother. Now, Glenn is asking his audience to join him to help save 8,000 babies.  It costs PreBorn $5,000 per day to carry out all their services, which saves an average of 200 babies daily. To conclude his 40-Day Biblical Covenant series, Glenn wants to fund PreBorn for 40 days, which will save a total of 8,000 babies from abortion.  On air today, Glenn pledged $100,000, which will fund PreBorn for 20 days and save an average of 4,000 babies. Would you consider joining Glenn to fund PreBorn for a total of 40 days, saving 8,000 babies?  Glenn's Biblical Covenant Guide shows that something special happens when we commit to God for 40 days. Committing our lives to God isn't just about words??it's about action born out of a transformed life. Glenn recently recommitted himself to our national covenant to honor God and follow his commands. Now he's backing up those words with action. Will you join him?  Click HERE to learn more about PreBorn and join Glenn's mission to close out 2023 by saving 8,000 babies for the next 40 days.     WRITER  Texas is under threat of a George Soros-backed takeover. Soros-funded RINO judges have been elected in some of the highest courts in Texas. These judges implemented restrict""ns that have blocked nearly a thousand cases of voter fraud from being investigated or prosecuted from across the state. These new restrictions are similar to ones in place in states like George, Arizona, and Wisconsin, leaving Texas more susceptible to election corruption than ever. If Texas falls to corruption, America will lose its largest bastion of conservative electoral power in the nation. Without Texas, Republicans WILL NOT be able to win national elections and liberal corruption will go unchecked across the country.  Fortunately, there is a way to stop this: YOU. If you live in Texas you have a chance to stand up against corruption and to fight back! Starting Tuesday, February 20th, early voting for the primaries begins, where three of these judges are up for election. Go out and vote. If the right people are voted in, there's a good chance the restrictions will be lifted and election fraud can once again be prosecuted.  But remember, you can't just go in and vote for anyone who has an ""R"" next to their name. Sorors knows that a registered Democrat would never stand a chance in Texas, so his lackeys register as Republicans and ride the little ""R"" right into office. So who do you vote for?  Fortunately, Glenn had Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on his show today and Ken gave us his list of judges that he vouches for. His list is as follows:    WRITER  Who is really banning books? For years now, Conservatives have been taking flak from the left for supposed ""book bans."" The left likes to compare these ""bans"" to Nazi book burnings, accusing the right of sweeping authoritarian decrees designed to suppress information. In reality, this is a movement largely motivated by parents, who want to remove inappropriate books from children's libraries.  But if you want to discuss authoritarian book bans, look no further than the White House. As Glenn recently covered, the Biden administration has been pressuring the world's largest bookseller, Amazon, into suppressing books they disagree with. On February 5th, 2024, Ohio Representative Jim Jordan released a slew of subpoenaed documents that exposed pressure placed on Amazon by the Biden Administration. The documents, which Jordan dubbed ""The Amazon Files"" after Elon Musk's ""The Twitter Files,"" revealed an email conversation between Andrew Slavitt, a former White House senior adviser, and Amazon employees. In these emails, Slavitt complained that the top search results for books on ""vaccines"" were ""concerning"" and then requested that Amazon intervene. Amazon initially refused, not out of some altruistic concern for the free exchange of information. They thought any action taken would be ""too visible"" and would further exasperate the ??Harry/Sally narrative,?? referring to the outrage that followed Amazon's removal of Ryan T. Anderson??s book When Harry Became Sally.  Despite this initial refusal, Amazon agreed to meet with the White House a few days later. The number one item on their agenda was""oving books from the website. An Amazon employee even admitted that the reason they even took this meeting was due to the pressure being placed on them by the Biden Administration.  What was the result of this meeting? Amazon caved. They began to implement ways of limiting the outreach of books that challenged the mainstream vaccine narrative and other books the White House might not like. The White House was caught red-handed pressuring the world's largest bookseller to restrict the sale of books they consider in opposition to their narrative, and they have the gall to accuse conservatives of information suppression. This is just ONE of many actions committed by the Biden Administration that are more characteristic of a dictator than a president. What can you do about it? Fortunately, you are not dependent on Amazon and its corrupted algorithm to help you find books. Every week right here on GlennBeck.com, we highlight books that Glenn is reading or talking about in our ""Glenn's Bookshelf"" series. Here you can find a wide selection of books free from Amazon's filters. Be sure to sign up for Glenn's newsletter to find out about new additions to ""Glenn's Bookshelf"" every week.    WRITER   The left-wing media's most recent tirade is accusing Trump of being a dictator. But, as Glenn said, ""Everything they're accusing us of, they're doing."" Since day one, the Biden administration has overstepped the bounds placed on the executive branch set by the Constitution. In Glenn's most recent TV Special, he examined ten times Biden acted like a dictator, NOT a president. Here are 10 of Biden's Dictator Moves, and click HERE to get ALL of the research that went into this week's Glenn TV special:     WRITER   Every day it seems Glenn covers another story revealing how people across the world at all levels of power DESPISE the fact that YOU have rights, and they are actively trying to curtail them. Recently, there has been a string of attacks against the rights outlined in the First Amendment: the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, the freedom of assembly, and the freedom to petition. As a refresher, the First Amendment reads as follows: This is powerful stuff, there is a good reason the Founding Fathers made it the FIRST Amendment. It's also the reason why power-hungry elites are attacking it. These attacks are designed to control the way you think, speak, and believe, vote, what you read, and who holds your representatives responsible. The First Amendment is our strongest weapon against tyrants, and they know it. So what can you do about it? Hope that some wig in Washinton will eventually do something? We know how well that works. The best thing to do is to stay active, engage in the issues you care about, and exercise your rights.  So where to start? Here are a few things YOU can do to protect your First Amendment rights:                                Religion                                   The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is toyou guessed itpractice your faith. Become an active member in your place of worship, go to scripture studies, invite your friends to that late afternoon event, and walk the life. This can impact the way you spend money as well. Shop the businesses and brands that share your values, and don't shop at the ones that scorn them. Keeping the community alive and healthy is the best way to ensure that generations to come will be able to experience the freedom you enjoy.                              Speech                                   Much like religion, the best way to protect your freedom of speech is... to speak. Engage your friends and family in polite, civil conversation. Stand up for what you believe in, and make your case to your peers. Just remember to keep it friendly. No one ever won an argument by shouting down their opponent. The civil exchange of ideas is the cornerstone of our republic, and a dialogue where the participants are well-informed, considerate, compassionate, and open-minded can have permanent impacts on all involved.                              Press                                   Freedom of the Press seems a little tricky at first. Unless you work for the media, what are you supposed to do? Quit your job and go work for the local newspaper? The good news is that exercising this right is not nearly that difficult. In fact, you are currently doing it. The best thing you can do is to read from outlets that produce informative content. Want to know what Glenn consumes to stay informed every day?

Assembly                                    Anna Moneymaker / Staff | Getty ImagesFreedom of assembly is one of the more impactful yet underutilized freedoms in the First Amendment. Peaceably assembling and protesting with like-minded individuals can hugely influence politicians and policies while simultaneously creating community and fellowship between attendees. It's understandable why more people don't turn out. We're all busy people with busy schedules, and flying out to D.C. for the weekend seems like a daunting task to many. Thankfully, you don't have to go out all the way to D.C. to make a difference. Gather some like-minded people in your town and bring awareness to issues that impact your community. Big change starts locally, and exercising your freedom to assemble can be the catalyst to lasting impact.                               Petition                                   If you've been a long-time listener of Glenn, then you will have heard a few of his calls to action where he asks his audience to contact their representatives about a particular piece of policy. There is a good reason Glenn keeps on doing those: they work. Whether it's your local mayor or your senator, a call and an email go a long way. If you really want to make a change, convince your friends and family to reach out as well. The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is to??you guessed it??practice your faith. Become an active member in your place of worship, go to scripture studies, invite your friends to that late afternoon event, and walk the life. This can impact the way you spend money as well.

BECKNews_4," ""Our churches and our pulpits must wake up,"" Glenn says. 6 pro-life protesters now face up to 10.5 years in prison for violating the controversial FACE Act by just praying and singing near an abortion facility. Glenn believes it's people like these who are the true heroes among us. ""We love Jesus, we take the hits, and then we win,"" one of the protesters said. But what does this say about our country? Glenn reviews this story and others that show how corrupted our system has become.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: America.Our churches and our pulpits must wake up.Six pro-lifers who were convicted of charges, related to the Face Act, earlier on Tuesday, gathered alongside their friends and family. Outside of the federal courthouse, in Nashville, Tennessee. To sing and pray just minutes after being found guilty.The six -- I should give their name. Chet Gallagher of Tennessee.Coleman Boyd of Mississippi. Heather Idoni of Michigan. Carl Zastro of Michigan. Paul Vaughn of Tennessee. And Dennis Green of Virginia.They all face up to 10.5 years in prison, and fines worth 260,000 dollars, after being convicted of conspiracy, against the rights and violation of the face act. A federal law criminalizing the use of force or threats of force, that prevent someone from ascending into an abortion facility. Let me just tell you something, I saw the video. There were no threats. And there was no force. They were standing on the side of the hallway. Praying!Despite the steep punishment they face after the convictions.The six remained in good spirits.These are the kind of people, that will bring blessings from heaven.These are the kinds of people, that you -- when all is said and done, the next generation goes, that person was a hero.Despite the steep punishment they face after the conviction, the six remained in good spirits.And proceeded to sing and pray outside of the Fred Thompson courthouse, immediately after the verdict was announced.The jury composed of eight women and four men, took just under four hours to find all six defendants of all charges brought against them by the Biden administration.They said, quote, this is just normal Christianity. We love Jesus. We take the hits. And then we win.STU: Hmm.GLENN: As he spoke to the crowd, many family members were fighting back tears. That it gathered outside the courthouse.He urged those present to write letters to the convicted, including Idoni, who is being held in a Washington, DC, prison over a similar case.The group sang hymns like Holy, Holy, Holy, All Is Well With My Soul, and Amazing Grace, and also read passages like Psalm 91.This is in Nashville, Tennessee. While this is going on, somebody who I don't condone this at all. But somebody who chopped the head off of the devil statue, a Satan statue, is also being tried and convicted and going to prison.Hmm. They say it was a hate speech. Or a hate -- a hate act. A hate crime.Well, seeing that Satan is the father of all hatred, he was just following through. And just following Satan, by sharing his hatred, I guess.We have got to wake up.Our system has been so corrupted, because we have allowed it to be this way.New York City countless men, Yousef Salaam, a member of the Central Park five was pulled over in Harlem by police on Friday. Just days ahead of council vote on legislation, that would bury police and paperwork, over low-level stops.Salaam complained about the traffic stop, suggesting he had been pulled over without a reason, and that racial bias was a factor. However, the cop was wearing a body cam.He -- apparently, he was stopped.And you see on the body cam. He said, I don't even know why he was pulled over.He said, instead of answering my question, the officer stated, we're done here.And he proceeded to walk away. The fact the officer did not provide a rationale for the stop. The only legal stop at a level three reasonable suspicion, or higher for a vehicle stop. Calls into question how the NYPD justifies its stops of New Yorkers. And highlights the need for greater transparency, to ensure they're all constitutional.Yeah. Unfortunately, for him. Why did the cops stop him.Because he had an out of date license plate from a different state, that was three years out of step.He had moved to New York, three years before, never changed it.I don't know. You get stopped for that?I would. Then when he was stopped. Now, remember, this -- this guy said, you know, we know the danger that is out there, every time -- a single time a black man, in particular, gets behind the wheel of a car.The other reason why the cop stopped him. Is because his windows were tinted so heavily. That it couldn't see the -- you want to stop for race.He couldn't see through the window, to what the driver was.When he approached the car. He said, could you roll down the back window please. Because a cop had been shot by somebody with tinted windows like that, in the backseat.Then he looks in. No threats lurking behind.He identifies himself. And Salaam interrupts him, saying, I'm council member, Salaam.This district. District nine. What did the cops say back to him?See, this is where the racial bias really comes in.He said, oh, okay. Have a good one. You're working, right?Yeah. Take care, sir.That's what happened.If this guy stays on the council in New York City, write it off.If you can get away with besmirching, and probably would have gotten this guy fired. Had it not been for his body cam.And he was this polite, what will these people do to you?Nothing matters, to them.Nothing matters.Look at all the crime, that is happening.And what are they doing?They're going after religious people that are singing hymns.This is such an important election.You've got to sign up to make sure that you are on the board, so you can see and you can be somebody who is watching the polls.Watch the counting.I want Republicans there.I want Democrats there.I want independents there.I don't want just one side.I want honest brokers.I don't know. Because I think that's what most people in America want.It's got to be 90 percent of the people say. I just -- I don't care if my side loses, if it is fair!But I don't want any corruption.Well, unfortunately, all the people of power want that corruption.Because they can use it to divide us and to control us.By the way, more news on Michelle Obama. And I'm telling you, I think this is going to happen. Sources now claim, money men, behind Michelle could be the best candidate against Donald Trump. Money men have been contacted.By apparently, in 2022, a trial balloon by Michelle Obama and her husband, to test if they can get support from Wall Street, et cetera.She said, if I'm running, and I ask for your support, what would you -- would you -- would you back me?Apparently. Apparently.Then, she has just gone on to podcast. She admitted her concerns on Jay Shetty's podcast, on purpose.Telling him, what's going to happen in this next election?I'm terrified what could possibly happen. Who we select. Who speaks for us. Who holds that bully pulpit?It affects us in ways sometimes I think people take for granted. The fact that people think that the government, does it really even do anything?And I'm like, oh, my God. Our government does everything for us.And we can't take this democracy for granted. I worry sometimes that we do. These are the things that keep me up at night.Now, as Megyn Kelly mentioned. She doesn't have a book out. She doesn't have anything that she was promoting. Who called and said, hey. You should do this podcast with Michelle Obama.What happened there?And why is she saying this?I don't know. Could be nothing. But I just want to point out to Stu, who likes to lose money in bets.STU: My gambling record is incredible.I mean, I don't even think, it's not even gambling for me.I just win.That's all. That's how it works.GLENN: Really. Wow. Wow. Why are you still working here then?STU: I need to get enough money, to get into the big bets.I don't have a -- I'm working on it, though.GLENN: Okay. So I see the market here.Joe Biden has an implied probability of 80 percent.But he is -- you have to -- how does this work?Is this negative 400.STU: Negative 400, you bet $400 to win $100.In other words, you -- the overwhelming favorite, if you're minus 400.GLENN: Okay. So Hillary Clinton, plus 5,000, Gretchen Whitmer. Plus 10,000.Robert Kennedy, plus 6600. Tulsi Gabbard, plus 6600.Elizabeth Warren, plus 5,000.Kamala Harris, 1900.Dean Phillips. Up --STU: Plus 1900?That means basically 19 to one.GLENN: Yeah. Gavin Newsom, 800. To one.And Michelle --STU: Like eight to one.GLENN: I -- I don't --STU: So you bet $10, you get $80. GLENN: Okay. Michelle Obama, plus 400. STU: Bet $10, get $40 if you win.GLENN: Okay. And Joe Biden, negative 400.STU: Bet $40, get $10.GLENN: So Michelle Obama was nowhere on this list, until recently. She's now popped up.STU: I mean, look, people like you, are going to spend their money on people like Michelle Obama to win the nomination.GLENN: You want to make a bet?STU: Sure.GLENN: What would you like to bet?STU: What would you like to bet?GLENN: Well, the last time we made a bet was years and years ago, where you had to go on the steps of the Philadelphia Art Museum.STU: Wow. You remember that?GLENN: Oh, I do. I do.STU: Mid-2000s. Eagles' Super Bowl. I really wanted the day off to go to the game.GLENN: Right. Right.STU: You made me wager with you, that if the Eagles lost, I had to stand on the steps of the Rocky Museum, and say, Rocky was a loser too. GLENN: YeahSTU: That was...GLENN: ""Like all of Philadelphia, Rocky was a loser too.""And it made you very popular.STU: I was very popular, and somehow made it out of their alive. But lived to enjoy an actual Super Bowl championship, so I don't know what kind of precedent you're setting here with this wager.Look, do you actually -- what you've outlined with Michelle Obama is a plausible theory of something that could theoretically happen. Do you actually believe that it would happen.GLENN: I do.STU: More than 50 percent?GLENN: Yeah.STU: What -- give me a number, 75 percent?GLENN: Sixty.STU: 60 percent. We'll do 50/50. We'll have even odds. And I'll say, it will be Joe Biden.You say, it will be Michelle Obama.GLENN: So what does that mean. Even odds.STU: Yeah. Ten dollars. Win $10.GLENN: Okay. So let's bet a thousand bucks. Put your money where your mouth is.STU: You're saying, you will give me a thousand dollars, if Joe Biden is the nominee for the Democrats?GLENN: No. Wait. Wait. Wait. If he is the guy running when the election happens.STU: When the election happens?GLENN: Yeah. If he's the guy running when the election happens.STU: Like, he's the guy on the ballot, he's the guy we're voting for or against on that day.GLENN: And it's not some technicality. Like he's still on the ballot.STU: Right. I'm willing to be totally -- yes. I'm in, 100 percent.GLENN: All right. A thousand bucks. You've got it. It's a public bet. You can't back out of it. I, of course, can always say, that's not what America heard.STU: That is what you'll say.GLENN: I will not. I will not welch on that bet. I think there is a very strong chance that she is -- she is the one.STU: I think it's plausible. I just think my value here is really good.GLENN: Now, here's the thing.STU: Uh-huh.GLENN: I think she's the one that could change everything. So am I doing -- is this a well-spent thousand dollars? Because if I'm saying, yeah. It's going to happen. It's not going to happen. We've learned that --STU: You're hedging your life. I love that.GLENN: It's worth a thousand dollars to me, that she doesn't run.STU: Right. Tempt the fates.GLENN: Tempt the fates.    The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires?

New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy people on the left. The AOC's have taken over, places in the media.And places like this in New York.This is what it is thousand. So there's been one case. One. One in the entire seven years. Where they did this.Where they shut down a company, that had no obvious victims.The case was 1972.And it was a company, relatively small company, that was writing term papers, for college students. Okay.So I want to write my paper.GLENN: I want to break out in God bless America.STU: Capitalism is pretty impressive. Apparently, this didn't go over that well.What they said, there were no obvious victims here. The people bought the term papers. They didn't want to write them. They got the term papers. They said, they were defrauding the education system.GLENN: Which they were.STU: This is the one time. And it's a small tiny company. Let me give you the other times they've done this.Tell me if any of these sound like, hey, I have a good interest rate, on a loan I paid back.Number one, a breast cancer nonprofit was shut down a dozen years ago. For using nearly all its $9 million in donations to pay for director's salaries, perks, and other expenses, instead of funding free mammograms. Okay.So they told everyone, donate money for free. Mammograms. And they just took all the money for themselves.That's number one. Number two, a private equity timber.Faking big investment success, was closed down after stealing millions of dollars from thousands of investors.Okay?You can see.GLENN: Yeah. Got it. But on both of those so far, you have hundreds of thousands of people, you know, I'm sure. That gave -- they're all victims.The",-6,,-7
BECKNews_5," The church is the best of friends to a benevolent government and the worst of enemies to a tyrannical one. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Pastor Josh McPherson had no choice to but to oppose the lockdowns in his home state of Washington, where he says the abortion centers stayed open but it was ??illegal to sing in church for months.?? Pastor McPherson, who preaches at a non-denominational church, believes it's time to bring biblical teaching beyond the first century and recognize that the word of God has something to say about ??sex, money, power, and politics?? in 2024. For too long the state and ""Gov"" have stepped into the lane of the church, and pastors have stayed silent. But Pastor McPherson says the Bible and Jesus Christs teachings do not require us to submit to an evil government and that anyone who thinks we must submit to every dictate of our politicians has not studied their Bible OR their U.S. Constitution: If theres cowardice in the pulpits, therell be evil in the streets. As America continues to be smacked down by rising inflation, government overreach, the gender debate, and an invasion of migrants creating a crisis on our southern border, Pastor McPherson says it is time to ask: Does the Bible have anything to say about the clown show we are living in?       The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people.

We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio.

That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy people on the left. The AOC's have taken over, places in the media.And places like this in New York.This is what it is thousand. So there's been one case. One. One in the entire seven years. Where they did this.Where they shut down a company, that had no obvious victims.The case was 1972.And it was a company, relatively small company, that was writing term papers, for college students. Okay.So I want to write my paper.GLENN: I want to break out in God bless America.STU: Capitalism is pretty impressive. Apparently, this didn't go over that well.What they said, there were no obvious victims here. The people bought the term papers. They didn't want to write them. They got the term papers. They said, they were defrauding the education system.GLENN: Which they were.STU: This is the one time. And it's a small tiny company. Let me give you the other times they've done this.Tell me if any of these sound like, hey, I have a good interest rate, on a loan I paid back.Number one, a breast cancer nonprofit was shut down a dozen years ago. For using nearly all its $9 million in donations to pay for director's salaries, perks, and other expenses, instead of funding free mammograms. Okay.So they told everyone, donate money for free. Mammograms. And they just took all the money for themselves.That's number one. Number two, a private equity timber.Faking big investment success, was closed down after stealing millions of dollars from thousands of investors.Okay?You can see.GLENN: Yeah. Got it. But on both of those so far, you have hundreds of thousands of people, you know, I'm sure. That gave -- they're all victims.They gave their money.STU: Yeah. And they didn't get the thing that they want.GLENN: They didn't get the thing they were promised. You have all these people going to the AG. Saying, hey, this is a real problem here. This has to stop. Not here.GLENN: Not here.STU: Another one. Mental health facility, shuttered for looting $4 million from public funds, while neglecting patients.GLENN: Okay. Kind of a big one.STU: Pretty clear. An auto lender that allegedly charged hidden interest rates, got to stay in business last year if it paid a fine and didn't commit fraud in the future.So here's one they didn't shut down.They actually let them go on.They're going after Trump in all of this. In this one, they're like, oh. Sure, they're hidden fees.They're not telling you about them.GLENN: Okay.STU: A judge requested.A judge refused to request to shut down a river rafting company in 2011.After a customer drowned, and the attorney general showed it was repeatedly using unlicensed guides, or none at all.Instead, he ordered only a 50,000-dollar bond and cleanup -- for him to clean up his act.The company is still being run today, under a different name by the same family. Someone died.GLENN: We have thousands of victims.And in this case, somebody who is dead.STU: Is dead!GLENN: Dead!STU: They're like, you guys can stay open -- and then this one is my favorite one. A judge in 2001.Declined to appoint a receiver, to take over a porn site, despite millions of dollars of illegal credit card charges to hundreds of customers.Who thought they were getting a free tour.Now, look, you're -- you want to get the free -- you want to know what you're subscribing for, Glenn. Before you just pulled the trigger on that. So you put your credit card information into a porn site, I think some of these victims need some life changes to be made here.But they put their credit card into a porn site. Expecting a free tour.They instead, get charged and charged and charged and charged.In fact, once the owners of the site were caught, they attempted to move their money overseas, to avoid any penalty.Still, the judge said, appointing a receiver was an extraordinary remedy!That should be used sparingly, and that a preliminary injunction was good enough.Only after all that happened, it they find out, the people running the porn site, were the Gambino crime family.(laughter)I kid you not. The Gambino crime family.GLENN: And they didn't go into receivership.STU: So there you go. Think about that.I mean, it's so obvious, what they're doing. Latitia james talked about it when she ran.Her goal was to take this one individual out.And the New York -- the voters of New York, said, good.Go do it.And now she's doing it.GLENN: Okay. If you are -- if you have business in in New York, if you're in New York, I'm just telling you. You have to do what you have to do.There's no way, I would keep my business in New York.There is no rule of law now. You know it on the streets. But there is no rule of law. If they can get away with this. They can do anything to you.   Elon Musk has announced that the first Neuralink patient can now control a computer mouse by just thinking. But while this technology could help a lot of people, should we proceed with caution? Between AI and this new merger of man and machine, Glenn gives a warning about what the future could hold. Glenn and Stu also review the controversy surrounding Googles Gemini AI, which refused to generate images of white people.     Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: So the website, Down Detector, detected a surge in outage reports from users at AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Customer Cellular, Boost Mobile, US Cellular, and Straight Talk.That the reports of the system being downed or outages, began at 3:45 a.m. Eastern time. The outages have been reported across many major US cities.It looks like, that it is back up. I'm not sure.They say, they don't think this was a cyber attack.But how did all of them go down at the same time?I mean, that's kind of weird.Yesterday, Israel had a cyber attack.It was from Iran. The Israelis say. And it was an attack on their cell phone services.So quite a coincidence. But let's not jump to any conclusions. Let's see what actually happened.Cyber attacks are going to happen. At some point, soon. We will have cyber attacks. And it will leave you vulnerable, if that's what you depend on.We are becoming more and more, a society that is connected in all things, and absolutely incapable of doing any things, without our electronics.We hit a milestone yesterday. This is truly like landing a man on the moon, I think. This is -- this is the first real merging of man and machine, I think. I mean, we've had the electronic. You know, the bionic arms and things like that.But this is in your mind.It's Neuralink. Elon Musk came up with it. And it is really tempting, because this is -- you know, this will be great to some degree. You'll be able to access information, and have the old internet in your head. You want to speak French?Okay. Download it. Got it.I mean, it is really -- isn't that the Matrix?STU: Yeah. The Matrix too. We're turning into The Matrix. That's the theme of the show today. GLENN: So that is now the beginnings of that, happened and was announced yesterday. Elon Musk said, Neuralink is active in the first person, to have one of the chips implanted in their brain. They have seemingly made a full recovery.We -- you know, so far. We don't know what the effects of this are, or will be. But Musk said, the patient can now move the mouse around a screen, just by thinking.So he has Bluetoothed himself to the screen.Crazy. Huh.STU: It's incredible that they can do that. And, you know, also, look at the way Elon Musk does business.This is a lot of what he does. Which is a lot of kind of just -- let's try it. There's a lot of -- hey, let's give it a whirl.GLENN: He said I think yesterday or earlier this week, that he had plans by 2029, to have a million people on Mars.And when I heard that, I thought, there's no -- oh, it's Elon Musk. Maybe.STU: Well, yeah. And this is his goal, with all of this stuff. He has -- I think it's a T-shirt or something. He wears. Like occupy mars.This is the central idea of his life.GLENN: And this is part of it. Neuralink is part of it.He believes that we are on such a dystopian track right now. That because of global warming, but also because of AI.He believes AI is just as dangerous as global warming. He believes we cannot compete with AI.Unless we can merge with it. Okay.Because it will be operating at such high speeds. We don't have the processing capabilities for the speeds.You know, it's kind of like -- kind of like dogs. Dog life. Seven years. One year for us.It's like one year is a thousand years for AI.So it's moving at such a rapid speed, we won't be able to keep up. So he believes that we need to be able to merge with the machine, until we can get off, this planet.I don't think he'll be taking Neuralink with him. Or maybe he just thinks we won't have access to this AI on Mars.But that's really what is -- is driving him. Driving his whole life.STU: It's really, really hard.Because I know, it feels creepy. And there are risks. And all of that.But it's like, it's really, really hard to think about telling someone, who is paralyzed that, no. We could make you move. But we don't want to pursue that technology.Like, I don't know. I mean, it's just -- it's such incredible technology.And for all of the other stuff, that he's done. Which is really impressive. I mean, Elon Musk is an impressive dude.Space travel. You know, the electric car stuff. I don't care about the electric car stuff that much. But it's still really impressive what he's been able to do.Everyone basically said, you couldn't do it. And no other company could be able to do that. He did that. He's done so many incredible things. But if he was able to take people, you know, with disabilities. And all these -- these issues that have been unsolvable throughout all of human history, and somehow figure out a way to -- through Neuralink or something similar, to solve that for people, it would be the greatest thing he has ever accomplished by a long shot.GLENN: So my daughter Mary had brain surgery, about three, four years ago.STU: Yeah. I remember.GLENN: And it was perfect for a long time.All of her seizures went away. Earlier this year, I think it was in the summer, she started to have breakthrough seizures.And they are even on medication now, they are grand mal. They are --STU: Hmm.GLENN: They're just terrifying. And -- and I said to her, this was about four years ago.I said, honey, if you wai",-2,,-2
BECKNews_6,"WRITER   	Are foreign wars distracting us from what's happening at home? For the last month, the 	 Israel-Hamas war has dominated the headlines. Stories of horrific tragedies, mounting conflict, and looming international war have absorbed much of the national conversation since the first Hamas attack on October 7th, and for good reason. However, just last week, we received a harsh reminder of the challenges within our own nation. As Glenn explained, the results of the 2023 off-year election arent good for Republicans, with states like Ohio making radical leaps in legalizing marijuana and abortion. Meanwhile in D.C., the new speaker, Mike Johnson, is already faced with an impending government shutdown as he tries to wrangle the House Republicans into an agreement.   	This begs the question, what should we be focused on? What is more important? Should we be focused on issues that directly affect Americans domestically? Or are the mounting tensions and looming world war more pressing? Let us know what you think below.      WRITER  Texas is under threat of a George Soros-backed takeover. Soros-funded RINO judges have been elected in some of the highest courts in Texas. These judges implemented restrictions that have blocked nearly a thousand cases of voter fraud from being investigated or prosecuted from across the state. These new restrictions are similar to ones in place in states like George, Arizona, and Wisconsin, leaving Texas more susceptible to election corruption than ever. If Texas falls to corruption, America will lose its largest bastion of conservative electoral power in the nation. Without Texas, Republicans WILL NOT be able to win national elections and liberal corr""ption will go unchecked across the country.  Fortunately, there is a way to stop this: YOU. If you live in Texas you have a chance to stand up against corruption and to fight back! Starting Tuesday, February 20th, early voting for the primaries begins, where three of these judges are up for election. Go out and vote. If the right people are voted in, there's a good chance the restrictions will be lifted and election fraud can once again be prosecuted.  But remember, you can't just go in and vote for anyone who has an ""R"" next to their name. Sorors knows that a registered Democrat would never stand a chance in Texas, so his lackeys register as Republicans and ride the little ""R"" right into office. So who do you vote for?  Fortunately, Glenn had Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on his show today and Ken gave us his list of judges that he vouches for. His list is as follows:    WRITER  Who is really banning books? For years now, Conservatives have been taking flak from the left for supposed ""book bans."" The left likes to compare these ""bans"" to Nazi book burnings, accusing the right of sweeping authoritarian decrees designed to suppress information. In reality, this is a movement largely motivated by parents, who want to remove inappropriate books from children's libraries.  But if you want to discuss authoritarian book bans, look no further than the White House. As Glenn recently covered, the Biden administration has been pressuring the world's largest bookseller, Amazon, into suppressing books they disagree with. On February 5th, 2024, Ohio Representative Jim Jordan released a slew of subpoenaed documents that exposed pressure placed on Amazon by the Biden Administration. The documents, which Jordan dubbed ""The Amazon Files"" after Elon Musk's ""The Twitter Files,"" revealed an email conversation between Andrew Slavitt, a former White House senior adviser, and Amazon employees. In these emails, Slavitt complained that the top search results for books on ""vaccines"" were ""concerning"" and then requested that Amazon intervene. Amazon initially refused, not out of some altruistic concern for the free exchange of information. They thought any action taken would be ""too visible"" and would further exasperate the ??Harry/Sally narrative,?? referring to the outrage that followed Amazon's removal of Ryan T. Anderson??s book When Harry Became Sally.  Despite this initial refusal, Amazon agreed to meet with the White House a few days later. The number one item on their agenda was""oving books from the website. An Amazon employee even admitted that the reason they even took this meeting was due to the pressure being placed on them by the Biden Administration.  What was the result of this meeting? Amazon caved. They began to implement ways of limiting the outreach of books that challenged the mainstream vaccine narrative and other books the White House might not like. The White House was caught red-handed pressuring the world's largest bookseller to restrict the sale of books they consider in opposition to their narrative, and they have the gall to accuse conservatives of information suppression. This is just ONE of many actions committed by the Biden Administration that are more characteristic of a dictator than a president. What can you do about it? Fortunately, you are not dependent on Amazon and its corrupted algorithm to help you find books. Every week right here on GlennBeck.com, we highlight books that Glenn is reading or talking about in our ""Glenn's Bookshelf"" series.

WRITER   The left-wing media's most recent tirade is accusing Trump of being a dictator. But, as Glenn said, ""Everything they're accusing us of, they're doing."" Since day one, the Biden administration has overstepped the bounds placed on the executive branch set by the Constitution. In Glenn's most recent TV Special, he examined ten times Biden acted like a dictator, NOT a president. Here are 10 of Biden's Dictator Moves, and click HERE to get ALL of the research that went into this week's Glenn TV special:     WRITER   Every day it seems Glenn covers another story revealing how people across the world at all levels of power DESPISE the fact that YOU have rights, and they are actively trying to curtail them. Recently, there has been a string of attacks against the rights outlined in the First Amendment: the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, the freedom of assembly, and the freedom to petition. As a refresher, the First Amendment reads as follows: This is powerful stuff, there is a good reason the Founding Fathers made it the FIRST Amendment. It's also the reason why power-hungry elites are attacking it. These attacks are designed to control the way you think, speak, and believe, vote, what you read, and who holds your representatives responsible. The First Amendment is our strongest weapon against tyrants, and they know it. So what can you do about it? Hope that some wig in Washinton will eventually do something? We know how well that works. The best thing to do is to stay active, engage in the issues you care about, and exercise your rights.  So where to start? Here are a few things YOU can do to protect your First Amendment rights:                                Religion                                   The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is toyou guessed itpractice your faith. Become an active member in your place of worship, go to scripture studies, invite your friends to that late afternoon event, and walk the life. This can impact the way you spend money as well. Shop the businesses and brands that share your values, and don't shop at the ones that scorn them. Keeping the community alive and healthy is the best way to ensure that generations to come will be able to experience the freedom you enjoy.                              Speech                                   Much like religion, the best way to protect your freedom of speech is... to speak. Engage your friends and family in polite, civil conversation. Stand up for what you believe in, and make your case to your peers. Just remember to keep it friendly. No one ever won an argument by shouting down their opponent. The civil exchange of ideas is the cornerstone of our republic, and a dialogue where the participants are well-informed, considerate, compassionate, and open-minded can have permanent impacts on all involved.                              Press                                   Freedom of the Press seems a little tricky at first. Unless you work for the media, what are you supposed to do? Quit your job and go work for the local newspaper? The good news is that exercising this right is not nearly that difficult. In fact, you are currently doing it. The best thing you can do is to read from outlets that produce informative content. Want to know what Glenn consumes to stay informed every day?

Assembly                                    Anna Moneymaker / Staff | Getty ImagesFreedom of assembly is one of the more impactful yet underutilized freedoms in the First Amendment. Peaceably assembling and protesting with like-minded individuals can hugely influence politicians and policies while simultaneously creating community and fellowship between attendees. It's understandable why more people don't turn out. We're all busy people with busy schedules, and flying out to D.C. for the weekend seems like a daunting task to many. Thankfully, you don't have to go out all the way to D.C. to make a difference. Gather some like-minded people in your town and bring awareness to issues that impact your community. Big change starts locally, and exercising your freedom to assemble can be the catalyst to lasting impact.                               Petition                                   If you've been a long-time listener of Glenn, then you will have heard a few of his calls to action where he asks his audience to contact their representatives about a particular piece of policy. There is a good reason Glenn keeps on doing those: they work. Whether it's your local mayor or your senator, a call and an email go a long way. If you really want to make a change, convince your friends and family to reach out as well. The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is to??you guessed it??practice your faith. Become an active member in your place of worship, go to scripture studies, invite your friends to that late afternoon event, and walk the life. This can impact the way you spend money as well.

BECKNews_7,"WRITER  The Iowa Caucus confirmed what many had predicted: Trump is the GOP frontrunner, and Nikki Haley is the favorite amongst the ""never-Trump"" wing of the Republican party??to the ire of pro-Trump conservatives. Glenn says that Nikki Haley has drawn so much criticism from the rest of the Republican party because her campaign stances are ""ut of step with where conservatives are right now."" Conservatives are tired of sending their taxpayer dollars to foreign wars. Haley has taken a strong stance in support of ongoing aid to Ukraine. Conservatives are yearning for leaders who take a strong stance against the establishment. Haley seems to embody the establishment that conservatives want to do away with. These are just a few of many qualms that hardline conservatives have with the former ambassador to the UN.  However, there are supporters of Nikki Haley, and one of them left an anonymous letter on Glenn's desk defending her candidacy. Curious as to what's going on in the mind of a Nikki Haley fan?

Recently, there has been a string of attacks against the rights outlined in the First Amendment: the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, the freedom of assembly, and the freedom to petition. As a refresher, the First Amendment reads as follows: This is powerful stuff, there is a good reason the Founding Fathers made it the FIRST Amendment. It's also the reason why power-hungry elites are attacking it. These attacks are designed to control the way you think, speak, and believe, vote, what you read, and who holds your representatives responsible. The First Amendment is our strongest weapon against tyrants, and they know it. So what can you do about it? Hope that some wig in Washinton will eventually do something? We know how well that works. The best thing to do is to stay active, engage in the issues you care about, and exercise your rights.  So where to start? Here are a few things YOU can do to protect your First Amendment rights:                                Religion                                   The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is toyou guessed itpractice your faith. Become an active member in your place of worship, go to scripture studies, invite your friends to that late afternoon event, and walk the life. This can impact the way you spend money as well. Shop the businesses and brands that share your values, and don't shop at the ones that scorn them. Keeping the community alive and healthy is the best way to ensure that generations to come will be able to experience the freedom you enjoy.                              Speech                                   Much like religion, the best way to protect your freedom of speech is... to speak. Engage your friends and family in polite, civil conversation. Stand up for what you believe in, and make your case to your peers. Just remember to keep it friendly. No one ever won an argument by shouting down their opponent. The civil exchange of ideas is the cornerstone of our republic, and a dialogue where the participants are well-informed, considerate, compassionate, and open-minded can have permanent impacts on all involved.                              Press                                   Freedom of the Press seems a little tricky at first. Unless you work for the media, what are you supposed to do? Quit your job and go work for the local newspaper? The good news is that exercising this right is not nearly that difficult. In fact, you are currently doing it. The best thing you can do is to read from outlets that produce informative content. Want to know what Glenn consumes to stay informed every day?

Assembly                                    Anna Moneymaker / Staff | Getty ImagesFreedom of assembly is one of the more impactful yet underutilized freedoms in the First Amendment. Peaceably assembling and protesting with like-minded individuals can hugely influence politicians and policies while simultaneously creating community and fellowship between attendees. It's understandable why more people don't turn out. We're all busy people with busy schedules, and flying out to D.C. for the weekend seems like a daunting task to many. Thankfully, you don't have to go out all the way to D.C. to make a difference. Gather some like-minded people in your town and bring awareness to issues that impact your community. Big change starts locally, and exercising your freedom to assemble can be the catalyst to lasting impact.                               Petition                                   If you've been a long-time listener of Glenn, then you will have heard a few of his calls to action where he asks his audience to contact their representatives about a particular piece of policy. There is a good reason Glenn keeps on doing those: they work. Whether it's your local mayor or your senator, a call and an email go a long way. If you really want to make a change, convince your friends and family to reach out as well. The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is to??you guessed it??practice your faith. Become an active member in your place of worship, go to scripture studies, invite your friends to that late afternoon event, and walk the life. This can impact the way you spend money as well.

BECKNews_8," Tucker Carlson went viral for claiming that Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin threatened Congress by saying if they don't approve another $60 billion for Ukraine, ""we'll send your uncles, cousins, and sons to fight Russia.?? But did he actually threaten to send U.S. troops to Ukraine? Glenn speaks with Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX), who was there, to get the truth. And he didn't hold back: ""he Secretary alluded to saying, 'if you guys don't do this, effectively we're going to be committing U.S. troops to war."" Rep. Roy explains why he believes it's not a lack of Ukraine funding, but the Biden administration's terrible policies that are ""empowering our enemies."" He also explains his effort to defund the United Nations and the controversy surrounding Rep. Tommy Tuberville's holdup of Senate confirmations of hundreds of military nominations.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: We have Chip Roy coming up in a couple of minutes. Chip is the representative from the great state of Texas.He and Mike Lee and, who was the third one from -- from I think it was Alabama, wasn't it? Pat.PAT: Tommy Tuberville, it wasn't him?GLENN: No. No. No. Tuberville, I tell you, I think that guy is a hero for what he has done.I think all of the stuff that he has, you know, done to stop abortion and everything else.PAT: Yeah.GLENN: And he's just been raked over the coals by the wonderful G.O.P. Makes me sick.Makes me really sick.So they -- they came out yesterday, and they want to put an end and defund the United Nations, and all of its subsidiaries.So the WHO. And everything else, would be a thing of the past.PAT: And Mike Lee is a part of that. Did you already mention?GLENN: Yeah.PAT: So good.GLENN: And it would be really good.Don't know how they're going to make this case.And win. But I'm glad somebody is at least making this case. There's so much going on here, right before the end of the year.We have Chip Roy on with us now. Hi, Chip. How you are?CHIP: Hey, Glenn, how you are?GLENN: I have a lot of stuff to ask you about. First of all, let's start with the UN. What prompted this with you guys?And what is the plan?CHIP: Well, first of all, it's not a new concept. Obviously, for those of us who hate the United Nations for a long time. I believe it's a colossal waste of money. Twelve and a half billion dollars of American tax dollars and borrowed money, that's gone to the UN. And that's in 2021. Okay. One year.Mike Lee and I were talking about this. So disgusted about what we've seen in the United Nations.There were in terms of how they treated Israel, voting not to condemn Hamas. There were funding Hamas, through UNRRA, which is done in the name of refugees, but ends up funding Hamas. You know, their human rights council, which is a complete sham, they put all the worst human rights violators on it. Funding, you know, the China one child policy. I mean, you can't even begin to do it. Then you saw the article yesterday, that Mike Lee tweeted out. Mike and I, you know, he introduced the Senate version. I introduced the House version. To totally just defund the United Nations, just get out. And Mike tweeted out a picture of an article about how all of these UN workers have been raping children in Africa and other places around the world. And look, it's just an organization devoid of soul. They don't believe in western civilization. They are not our friend. Why do we fund it? It's just a joke, and we shouldn't.GLENN: Is this something that you think could gain traction and win?CHIP: I mean, not in the instant. I think we need to get very serious about it. I will say, to the credit of the house, I'm pretty vicious in my condemnation of the failures of House Republicans. But in fairness, right? We're dealing with a recalcitrant Senate, that doesn't want to do anything. A White House, that is not just incompetent, but evil.We passed appropriations bills, in our sting board operations, that would have defunded a lot. Not all of it. It wasn't perfect, but it defunded a lot of these terrible things. Like UNRRA. Like the Chinese policy. Mario D?az-Balart, in Florida. He worked with us on that. But then just sitting in the Senate, right? The senate won't do anything with it. So we've introduced this bill as a standalone, basically kind of one up on all this. And send a message that you have serious members of the Senate and the House saying, wait a minute, we should not be sending 12 and a half billion dollars to the United Nations. So, you know, we'll have to keep working the issue. But I know you agree and I know your listeners agree.GLENN: So the next thing is the spending bills. And the fact that this defense bill, first of all, if I'm not mistaken, it was yesterday that Lloyd Austin said, if you fail to pass this Ukraine aid bill, US troops on the ground in Ukraine are likely.What kind of threat is that?CHIP: Yeah. And so let's take them in order, right? You're talking about the supplemental spending bill at the moment. That includes on the Democrat's side, right?Because the president put it forward. It has a massive amount of spending. Over $100 billion. $60 billion additional funding for Ukraine. I think it's ten or $15 billion of additional spending at the border, which would just be used to process more people. Not change the policies.More spending for Taiwan. More spending, generally. And so we would oppose that. And, yes, in a briefing, the other day, the secretary alluded to, you know, saying -- you know, you guys don't do this.You know, effectively we will be committing American troops to war. Now, if you're being less cynical.You would say his position is, that if we don't push back on Putin now, we will get drawn into a war that involves our men and women in uniform. To which my response is, no, if you keep carrying out your incompetent policies, where you were abused to promote American energy, or you were abused to actually sanction, for example, Iran. You allow Iran to provide oil to China. You take all the positions that are empowering our enemies. Then you say, we need to fund a proxy war. To stop our enemies. Or you will send our men and women to war. Oh, and, by the way, they wanted to draft your daughters. Which I proudly stood up and stopped. That's the truth of this administration.So we will stand up. And thwart that. At least conservatives are. And I hope that Mike Johnson keeps doing what he's doing. I'm critical when I'm critical. But I'm complimentary when I'm complimentary.Mike will send a strong message, that we will not even remotely consider Ukraine funding until the border is secure. I hope he sticks to that.I don't -- you know, I think we need to question Ukraine spending, generally.But I know for certain, we shouldn't even mention the word, until the border of the United States is secure.GLENN: I agree.How is he doing, by the way? So far. Johnson.CHIP: Mike, as you know, is a very good friend. Is a very good man.On that point, I think he's done a very good job. On sending over Israel, immediately. First day on the job. And that next week funded with taking money out of the IRS expansion. I think he did a great job.Look, I think he needs to not give in to the pressures of the swamp.The swamp makes -- that he work on the addiction of pressure.Oh, my God. If you don't pass that, by December 31st, the world will end.Then suddenly, people will end up. We will all die. That's how the swamp works.He should resist that. This national defense authorization act. Which is a terrible bill.It's not the House bill, which fixes the abortion -- I'm sorry, the abortion. Tourism. It fixed transgender surgeries. It fixed the DEI and woke stuff. It fixed some of the climate change stuff.GLENN: That was all thrown out, right?CHIP: Yeah. Most of that. Like 90 percent of that was thrown out.So the Defense Bill was bad on its face. Then now they want to add FISA extensions, which, Glenn, for your listeners means using back door foreign intelligence, to go after American citizens.We want to end that.We passed a good bill in the judiciary committee to end that. But unfortunately, Mike has agreed with Senate Democrats to put a, quote, short-term extension of the existing bill which allows the spying, until April, and that would actually last until the spring of '25. We oppose it. All of your listeners who tell every single one of your members of Congress, senators, to oppose the NDA, that has FISA on it. Because if we vote on it next week, we need at least 150 Republicans to stand up and block that bill.GLENN: Jeez. Do you have 150?CHIP: Well, we also may get some Democrats. So maybe a little bit fewer. I want as many Republicans as we can get.And depending on how many Democrats we can get to block it. They will try to pass it on what we call suspension of the rules. Which means I need 200 roughly 90 votes.So we need 140 or so, of both Republicans and Democrats to kill it.So we want to get as many Republicans as possible to say, we're not going to jam through a 3,000-page watered down crappy defense authorization, that continues the wokification of the military. Instead of a mission-first military.You know, it's driving down morale, it's driving down recruiting. And then, oh, by the way, continue the FISA spying regime, which has been abusing power to spy on Americans. We should stop that.We have conservatives, that have good bills. We're advancing. We just passed it out of the Judiciary Committee, on a bipartisan basis. That is what we should be advancing over to the Senate.GLENN: Tell me about Tommy Tuberville. Because I think he's a hero. He stood and stood and stood. And damn near no Republicans stood with him.And he was -- I mean, he's just been bashed and bashed. And he finally said, okay. Tell me what happened here.CHIP: Well, Coach Tuberville, Senator Tuberville is a good man. I've gotten to know him well. Funny enough, his legislative director is a very good friend of mine, and my roommate when I'm in DC.Look, Coach Tuberville is someone who stood up on the side of life, like he said he would do. Unlike a lot of Republicans. That run on being pro-life. And then when the battle faces them, they run away.Right? The other senator from Alabama, touts herself as being Ms. Pro-life.But did she go down and support Coach Tuberville? No.A whole bunch of other senators. I can go through a list. Didn't stand up.Mike Lee was down there. God bless him.Roger Marshal went down there.But not that many, went down and supported Coach Tuberville when he went to the floor to object. And, by the way, Glenn. All he was saying was, we should vote on these confirmations, at the Defense Department.That's it. That's all he was demanding. And making us do that, because he said, guys, if you're going to continue to advance an unlawful policy to have taxpayers fund abortion, tourism and Department of Defense, I will make you do the work of getting these things done through votes.I'm sorry, that he backed down last week.I wish he held firm a little longer.This is the same issue in the National Defense Authorization Act. We fix it in house. We should force the Senate to address it. But instead, Republicans are about. If we don't stop them, Republicans are going to move a defense bill, that does not address the abortion issue. That does not address transgender surgeries. That does not address climate change, that does not sufficiently address diversity, equity, inclusion garbage. That does not sufficiently restore people that lost their jobs for COVID. And adds FISA spying extension. In what world should we do that? Coach Tuberville did a great job. We should finish the job now.GLENN: I have about 70 seconds here for this answer.CHIP: Yep.GLENN: The Hunter Biden indictment, is it going anywhere? Also, the -- the impeachment, is it going anywhere?CHIP: On Tuesday, in the House Rules Committee, we will be taking up, and I serve on the Rules Committee, an impeachment inquiry vote, which we intend to take to the floor. And I hope and believe will pass on the House floor. We have a couple of members that are a little wishy-washy.But I hope to get it there. If we can do that, that's the additional tools that we need, to get more information, and force the Biden administration to stop their obstruction. That's what it is.Of our seeking the truth of what we all know.Is that money flowing through Hunter. Was flowing through Hunter to Joe Biden. We believe. We have to get more information.Certainly, in a conspiracy with Joe Biden, while enriching his son, using foreign actors to do it. To the detriment of our national security and well-being.And so Hunter, of course, now that you asked about the indictments. The indictments that were brought down yesterday.They seemed fairly significant.With respect to the tax laws, that were violated.He was writing off hookers and sex clubs.He was writing off any number of things you can do.And I haven't study the indictments. I have looked at the summaries.They seem to be significant.But remember, they walked away. And they led the statute of limitations run on some very, very significant tax violations. From 2014 to '15. When Biden was vice president.We believe that was intentional. We want to seek the truth on that.So we will keep running as much as we can with the tools we have.Jamie comber, Jim Jordan have done a good job. I hope every Republican will support this inquiry that we vote out on Tuesday.GLENN: I have tell you, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.Thank you for the handful of people that are around you. And Mike Lee. And others. That are actually moving the ball. Or trying to.I appreciate every day you guys are in that cesspool, so we don't have to be. Thank you for everything you do.CHIP: Well, Glenn. Well, we can't do it without you. Merry Christmas to all your listeners. Maybe I'll talk you to before Christmas. But I won't stop. I barely have a voice right now, but I don't give a damn.We got to save this country for our kids, Glenn. There's men who sat in the foxholes in Bastion in 1944, freezing to death. So we could live free.We shouldn't adjourn next week, if we haven't done our dang job. That's our position.GLENN: You call any time you need anything next week. Any time, you just call in. Thank you so much, Chip. Appreciate it.   The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, becau",-8,,-8
BECKNews_9," Glenn just purchased the entire historical Roe v. Wade archive as a solemn reminder of our nation's past and the vital importance of honoring the sacredness of life. Since Roe was overturned in 2022, many states have been stepping up to protect both their unborn citizens AND the mothers carrying them.  Which states are doing the most to protect their most vulnerable? Here are the top 12 states with the strictest laws against abortion.  ?Alabama has some of the nation's most protective pro-life measures, banning all abortions in the case of life-threatening circumstances for the mother. That means abortion is banned at every ?stage of pregnancy. Health care providers found guilty of performing abortions face a class-A felony, the most serious charge besides Capitol Murder, with the potential of carrying a life sentence in prison. However, the pill, Plan B, is classified as ""contraception"" rather than abortion. Taxpayer-funded Medicaid does not cover abortion procedures except in very limited circumstances.  Alabama is one of the few states to add protections within its state constitution for the unborn. The state: Like Alabama, Arkansas bans abortion at every stage of pregnancy except in life-threatening situations for the mother. However, Plan B is still considered ""contraception"" and is legal. Taxpayer-funded Medicaid does not cover abortion procedures except in very limited circumstances. Additionally, Arkansas added the amendment to its state constitution, declaring:  Idaho bans abortions at every stage of pregnancy with the exceptions of life-threatening situations to the mother and instances of rape and incest. The health care practitioner who gave an abortion must prove ""affirmative defense,"" which means they have to prove in court why the abortion is necessary and meets the legal criteria. Patients approved for abortion must wait 24 hours after counseling to receive the procedure. Anyone who performs an abortion unless it's in one of the approved cases will face felony charges. Like Alabama and Arkansas, taxpayer-funded Medicaid does not cover abortion procedures.  Unlike Alabama and Arkansas, Idaho law does not include explicit constitutional or statutory protections for abortion. Kentucky has also banned abortion at all stages of pregnancy except in life-threatening situations for the mother. There are no exceptions for rape or incest. However, abortion providers are fighting the all-out ban on abortion through appealing to the state's previous abortion ban after six weeks of pregnancy. The appeal is ongoing.   Though Kentucky voters voted down a proposal to add an amendment to the state constitution banning abortion, the state adopted the following policy towards abortion in 2018:  Louisiana also banned abortion at all stages of pregnancy with no exceptions for rape or incest. However there is an appeal to allow abortions in the case of rape and incest. Healthcare practitioners who violate this ban are subject to criminal prosecution. Moreover, Louisiana adopted an amendment in their state constitution??specifically, the Louisiana Declaration of Rights, banning the construction of any constitutional right to abortion: Mississippi bans all abortions except to save the life of the mother or in cases of rape or incest that have been reported to law enforcement. Though Mississippi did not adopt a constitutional amendment to ban abortion as a right, the Mississippi Code says:  Moreover, doctors who perform illegal abortions face civil and criminal charges.  Missouri bans all abortions except in the case of a medical emergency concerning the mother, with no exceptions for rape or incest. Those seeking to get an abortion must prove ""ffirmative defense,"" which means they have to prove in court why the abortion is necessary and meets the legal criteria.  Minors seeking an abortion through ""affirmative defense"" must do so with parental consent. Moreover, those seeking an abortion must be offered an ultrasound.  Moreover, Missouri adopted the following statute protecting the unborn: Oklahoma was the first state to successfully ban all abortions after conception following the overturn of Roe v. Wade and continues to lead the way as one of the toughest states on abortion. Exceptions include life-saving procedures for the mother or pregnancies resulting from ""rape, sexual assault, or incest."" Those who perform legal abortions can be reported and prosecuted criminally under state law HB427 and be charged at least $10,000 per illegal abortion procedure. Violations also include insurance companies or private citizens caught funding abortions.  Though Oklahoma has not adopted a state constitutional amendment concerning abortion, its Public Health Code states that it cannot be ??construed as creating or recognizing right to abortion."" South Dakota bans all abortions except in life-threatening cases for the mother. There are no exceptions for rape and incest. However, it is legal to travel out of state to get an abortion. There are no state constitutional provisions protecting against abortion.  Tennessee bans all abortions except in life-threatening cases for the mother. There is currently a movement in the Tennessee state legislature to enact exceptions for rape and incest. Like Idaho and Missouri, healthcare practitioners who gave an abortion must prove ""affirmative defense,"" which means they have to prove in court why the abortion is necessary and meets the legal criteria. Those who provide abortions illegally can be criminally prosecuted.  Tennessee's state constitution was amended to supersede a 2000 Tennessee supreme court case, which held:  The new state constitutional amendment reads as follows:  Texas bans all abortions except in life-threatening cases concerning the mother. There is a movement in the Texas state legislature to provide exemptions for rape and incest.  Moreover, Texas received a lot of heat for its law not only criminalizing providing illegal abortions but enabled citizens to report illegal abortions. However, several cities in Texas are pushing back against the abortion ban. After Dobbs, Texas increased the penalties for performing an abortion up to life in prison, including a civil penalty of no less than $100,000 per abortion performed. Attorney General Ken Paxton said the following: The cities of Austin and San Antonio passed ordinances preventing city funds from being used to investigate the provision or receipt of abortion care. West Virginia bans abortion at all stages of pregnancy, except in the case of a ??nonmedically viable fetus??, ectopic pregnancy, or medical emergency. According to the West Virginia state legislature, ""nmedically viable fetus"" means: Victims of rape and incest can obtain abortions up to eight weeks after conception, but only if they report to law enforcement first.  In 2018, West Virginians voted to add the following language to the state constitution:      WRITER  Texas is under threat of a George Soros-backed takeover. Soros-funded RINO judges have been elected in some of the highest courts in Texas. These judges implemented restrictions that have blocked nearly a thousand cases of voter fraud from being investigated or prosecuted from across the state. These new restrictions are similar to ones in place in states like George, Arizona, and Wisconsin, leaving Texas more susceptible to election corruption than ever. If Texas falls to corruption, America will lose its largest bastion of conservative electoral power in the nation. Without Texas, Republicans WILL NOT be able to win national elections and liberal corruption will go unchecked across the country.  Fortunately, there is a way to stop this: YOU. If you live in Texas you have a chance to stand up against corruption and to fight back! Starting Tuesday, February 20th, early voting for the primaries begins, where three of these judges are up for election. Go out and vote. If the right people are voted in, there's a good chance the restrictions will be lifted and election fraud can once again be prosecuted.  But remember, you can't just go in and vote for anyone who has an ""R"" next to their name. Sorors knows that a registered Democrat would never stand a chance in Texas, so his lackeys register as Republicans and ride the little ""R"" right into office. So who do you vote for?  Fortunately, Glenn had Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on his show today and Ken gave us his list of judges that he vouches for. His list is as follows:    WRITER  Who is really banning books? For years now, Conservatives have been taking flak from the left for supposed ""book bans."" The left likes to compare these ""bans"" to Nazi book burnings, accusing the right of sweeping authoritarian decrees designed to suppress information. In reality, this is a movement largely motivated by parents, who want to remove inappropriate books from children's libraries.  But if you want to discuss authoritarian book bans, look no further than the White House. As Glenn recently covered, the Biden administration has been pressuring the world's largest bookseller, Amazon, into suppressing books they disagree with. On February 5th, 2024, Ohio Representative Jim Jordan released a slew of subpoenaed documents that exposed pressure placed on Amazon by the Biden Administration. The documents, which Jordan dubbed ""The Amazon Files"" after Elon Musk's ""The Twitter Files,"" revealed an email conversation between Andrew Slavitt, a former White House senior adviser, and Amazon employees. In these emails, Slavitt complained that the top search results for books on ""vaccines"" were ""concerning"" and then requested that Amazon intervene. Amazon initially refused, not out of some altruistic concern for the free exchange of information. They thought any action taken would be ""too visible"" and would further exasperate the ??Harry/Sally narrative,?? referring to the outrage that followed Amazon's removal of Ryan T. Anderson??s book When Harry Became Sally.  Despite this initial refusal, Amazon agreed to meet with the White House a few days later. The number one item on their agenda was""oving books from the website. An Amazon employee even admitted that the reason they even took this meeting was due to the pressure being placed on them by the Biden Administration.  What was the result of this meeting? Amazon caved. They began to implement ways of limiting the outreach of books that challenged the mainstream vaccine narrative and other books the White House might not like. The White House was caught red-handed pressuring the world's largest bookseller to restrict the sale of books they consider in opposition to their narrative, and they have the gall to accuse conservatives of information suppression. This is just ONE of many actions committed by the Biden Administration that are more characteristic of a dictator than a president. What can you do about it? Fortunately, you are not dependent on Amazon and its corrupted algorithm to help you find books. Every week right here on GlennBeck.com, we highlight books that Glenn is reading or talking about in our ""Glenn's Bookshelf"" series. Here you can find a wide selection of books free from Amazon's filters. Be sure to sign up for Glenn's newsletter to find out about new additions to ""Glenn's Bookshelf"" every week.    WRITER   The left-wing media's most recent tirade is accusing Trump of being a dictator. But, as Glenn said, ""Everything they're accusing us of, they're doing."" Since day one, the Biden administration has overstepped the bounds placed on the executive branch set by the Constitution. In Glenn's most recent TV Special, he examined ten times Biden acted like a dictator, NOT a president. Here are 10 of Biden's Dictator Moves, and click HERE to get ALL of the research that went into this week's Glenn TV special:     WRITER   Every day it seems Glenn covers another story revealing how people across the world at all levels of power DESPISE the fact that YOU have rights, and they are actively trying to curtail them. Recently, there has been a string of attacks against the rights outlined in the First Amendment: the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, the freedom of assembly, and the freedom to petition. As a refresher, the First Amendment reads as follows: This is powerful stuff, there is a good reason the Founding Fathers made it the FIRST Amendment. It's also the reason why power-hungry elites are attacking it. These attacks are designed to control the way you think, speak, and believe, vote, what you read, and who holds your representatives responsible. The First Amendment is our strongest weapon against tyrants, and they know it. So what can you do about it? Hope that some wig in Washinton will eventually do something? We know how well that works. The best thing to do is to stay active, engage in the issues you care about, and exercise your rights.  So where to start? Here are a few things YOU can do to protect your First Amendment rights:                                Religion                                   The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is toyou guessed itpractice your faith. Become an active member in your place of worship, go to scripture studies, invite your friends to that late afternoon event, and walk the life. This can impact the way you spend money as well. Shop the businesses and brands that share your values, and don't shop at the ones that scorn them. Keeping the community alive and healthy is the best way to ensure that generations to come will be able to experience the freedom you enjoy.                              Speech                                   Much like religion, the best way to protect your freedom of speech is... to speak. Engage your friends and family in polite, civil conversation. Stand up for what you believe in, and make your case to your peers. Just remember to keep it friendly. No one ever won an argument by shouting down their opponent. The civil exchange of ideas is the cornerstone of our republic, and a dialogue where the participants are well-informed, considerate, compassionate, and open-minded can have permanent impacts on all involved.                              Press                                   Freedom of the Press seems a little tricky at first. Unless you work for the media, what are you supposed to do? Quit your job and go work for the local newspaper? The good news is that exercising this right is not nearly that difficult. In fact, you are currently doing it. The best thing you can do is to read from outlets that produce informative content. Want to know what Glenn consumes to stay informed every day?

Assembly                                    Anna Moneymaker / Staff | Getty ImagesFreedom of assembly is one of the more impactful yet underutilized freedoms in the First Amendment. Peaceably assembling and protesting with like-minded individuals can hugely influence politicians and policies while simultaneously creating community and fellowship between attendees. It's understandable why more people don't turn out. We're all busy people with busy schedules, and flying out to D.C. for the weekend seems like a daunting task to many. Thankfully, you don't have to go out all the way to D.C. to make a difference. Gather some like-minded people in your town and bring awareness to issues that impact your community. Big change starts locally, and exercising your freedom to assemble can be the catalyst to lasting impact.                               Petition                                   If you've been a long-time listener of Glenn, then you will have heard a few of his calls to action where he asks his audience to contact their representatives about a particular piece of policy. There is a good reason Glenn keeps on doing those: they work. Whether it's your local mayor or your senator, a call and an email go a long way. If you really want to make a change, convince your friends and family to reach out as well. The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is to??you guessed it??practice your faith. Become an active member in your place of worship, go to scripture studies, invite your friends to that late afternoon event, and walk the life. This can impact the way you spend money as well. Shop the businesses and brands that share your values, and don't shop at the ones that scorn them. Keeping the community alive and healthy is the best way ",-2,,-3
BECKNews_10," Rep. Jim Jordan has revealed an alleged attempt by the White House to pressure Amazon into censoring books that didn't fit its COVID-19 agenda. And yet, the Biden administration has had the gall to accuse the Right of ""banning books"" (aka removing inappropriate books from children's libraries). Glenn reviews this and 13 more times the Left has accused the Right of doing exactly what it has been doing.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: In today's Glenn Beck morning newsletter, which is free at GlennBeck.com. You will find these stories. And I will touch on these. Just the headlines. And then we will go back to them.Jim Jordan chose Amazon files, federal censorship efforts to digitally burn books.Effective G.O.P. attorney generals face politicized ethics charges. Democrats trying to strip all opponents of representation, in court.Biden's DOJ continues to abuse the face act.Completely unjustified medical journal retracts major studies critical of the abortion pill, ahead of the Supreme Court clash.Montana parents face arrest after refusing to go along with daughter's sex change.Virginia Democrats trying to pass a bill, to make bipartisan election oversight, a hate crime.Let me -- let me start with this.Stu, look up the definition of fascism, for me, will you?People, when they hear fascists. They think concentration camps.And that usually is the way they end.Because you have to have -- you know, you have to get rid of the political people that disagree with you.Because unless you're in a free state, you can't have people who disagree with you, speaking out.Okay?That's the definition. That's the first definition of freedom, is being able to speak your mind.Well, you can't do that.And it starts with intimidation.It starts with suggestion. Then intimidation. And then shove and shoot.So you have to have these concentration camps. But that's not -- that's not in the definition, if I'm not mistaken of fascism, Stu.STU: Give you the dictionary definition. A political philosophy, movement or regime, that exalts nation and often race, above the individual.It's just so --GLENN: Say it again. Say it again.STU: Exalts nation and often race, above the individual.Gee, who is doing that right now?Tell me who is elevating race above the individual right now?Tell me. Tell me with a straight face, that is the right. It is insanity to believe that. It's insanity. Every single person on the left is constantly telling us, that the skin color is the most important thing about you.We're -- it's constantly told to us, that it's defining your entire life.Your skin color tells you whether you're oppressed or not. Or whether you're a good person or you're not.And we're the ones somehow.It's so amazing how this happened. But it is a philosophy, movement, or regime that exalts nation and often race, above the individual, and that stands for a centralized autocratic government, headed by a dictator, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition.I don't know. Which party is about to lose their candidate from being on the ballot at all.Which one is that?A suppression of opposition.Oh, my gosh. I -- you're never going to get to any of your points if you don't turn off my microphone.GLENN: Yeah. I know. I think this is fine.It's incredible. And it doesn't include, the biggest part of the actual mechanics of fascism, which is public/private partnerships.Businesses are allowed to be businesses, unlike in -- in communism.They're allowed to be private businesses.Unless you disagree with the state. Then they'll intimidate you.And eventually, just take you out.Somebody else will get your business.And you're gone.Public/private partnership.Okay. Now, I just -- I -- I want to drill into your head, whatever they say that we're doing, they're doing.Okay. Good example. They just -- they call us fascists.Could you read that one more time, Stu.STU: Sure. A political philosophy, movement, or regime, that exalts nation and often race above the individual. That stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by dictator. Severe, economic, and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition.GLENN: Okay. You can see why they have to stand on nationalism.Okay? When we say, we're proud to be Americans, and we hold America high in our esteem, it's not at the expense of the individual. In fact, it's because of the -- the defense of the individual.We're nationalistic. Okay. Paragraph everything that the Constitution says. Everything that at least that I believe. And I think the vast majority of people, that are -- that claim to be conservative.That truly are conservative. It's because of the Declaration of Independence.The Constitution. And the Bill of Rights. Which is all about the individual. They're about collective salvation. So if you're not a collectivist society. Or you're not pushing for collectivism.You can't be a communist or a fascist.You can't! So everything they say we're up to, they're doing.And, I mean, just, they said Donald Trump was just killing us overseas. And none of our allies had any respect for us. Well, I think I can check that one. They say that we're nothing, but religious zealots, that would force our religion on children in schools. Who is doing that?We're asking for school choice, so the individual can choose if they want that or not.They're -- they've come up with this new woke crap. And LGBTQ, which is a religion!A religion requires excommunication, if you don't go along with the high priests.They demand that you stick to the dogma.There is no questioning of it. Which one has the religion that they're putting in schools?They say that we're going to have a dictator. Well, public/private partnerships. Silencing opposition. Environmental and social regulations. Medical tyranny. We've got that.The right is just in bed with big business.Really? Name the corporation that stands by the right, and -- and waives that flag. Name the corporation.It certainly isn't Coors. In bed with big business.That we don't really care about the lives of the poor, and the immigrant.And yet, with what they're doing, the immigrant is being used and built by the drug cartels. The women are being raped.Every day, sold into slavery. We don't care?Don't care about the poor. Really?Is your definition of caring for the poor, what's happening in LA? What's happening in San Francisco?Because I think, you don't care for the poor. We're going to make -- you know, they just want to -- they're going to throw you back in chains to the African-American.Who is doing that?I just want to overthrow the government. You know, those people on the right. They have no respect for the Constitution. They want to overthrow our system of government. You can't even name our system of government. You keep calling it a ten months. It's a republic.Well, they just want chaos in the streets. We do.You were the one with -- what was it? CHAZ in Seattle. You were the one that was trying to get rid of all of the police. And reimagine how we're going to take care of people in the streets. We're the ones that want chaos in the streets.They don't care about national security. You've had 10 million people coming across-the-board. We all know they're terrorists.Yeah. But they don't really care. I mean, you know, they -- they're terrorists themselves, you know.Well, really. Well, I guess if that's true, which it absolutely isn't. At least we're not farming it off to Hamas, and Hezbollah, and Iran.You support terrorists. You support the terrorists on the streets here in America. They're just going to take away your choice. My body, my choice.Really? Unless it's anything other than an abortion. You know, they just want to make sure that white people get the jobs.Well, you've lowered the standard at the FCC. I'm sorry. The FAA. Lowered the standard at the FAA to the point to where if you are ""Happy"", black, trans, whatever the flavor of the month is, they don't have to have the same test scores even. They don't even have to test and have the same amount of competence, to be an air traffic controller if they're not white. I don't think that's a good idea. Which one is hiring just solely on race?Now, here's the -- here's the last one. We're Nazis. In Florida, they've been banning books.Really?Really?We know that's not true. We know that came from the left. But, again, if we know that the left accuses us of things that they are doing. Let me give you this. Jim Jordan yesterday, revealed internal documents, revealed the sub -- sorry, the sub -- the subpoena of Amazon, highlighting the Biden administration's efforts to address propaganda and misinformation in books, for the online retailer.Okay. Wait a minute.They say, that I'm responsible for misinformation and propaganda.I will correct anything that I get wrong.You show me where I'm wrong, I will correct it.It's not a matter of opinion. It has to be a matter of fact.Show me where I'm wrong.They don't. They can't.I -- I am not for the banning of any voices.I want to make sure that everybody -- those who disagree with me. They should have a space in society. And should be heard. None of this digital ghetto stuff.They say, we're burning books, or we're banning books.And yet, now we have the documents. The effort. Reminiscent of the Twitter file.It starts with an email, in 2021. From a White House official. Seeking the opportunity to discuss the high levels of propaganda, and misinformation and disinformation. Of Amazon.Now, why were they so upset with Amazon.Well, because Amazon believed retailers are different than social media communities.And provided their customers with access to a variety of viewpoints. For the Biden administration. Letting Americans, actually, read the other side, is unacceptable.This is a country, that despises Naziism.And yet, you can buy Mein Kampf. You can't in Germany. Here you can. You can buy Mein Kampf. You can read Mein Kampf out in the open. It doesn't make you a Nazi. It makes you someone who wants to understand what happened back then. What was this guy even saying?Without even being able to read the insane ramblings. You have no idea what he was even really talking about.You have no idea, you can be duped into anything.You can be duped, that, you know what, the Germans really didn't know. Yes, they did.It's in Mein Kampf!But here, we can't argue about science anymore.You can't have those books on sale online on Amazon. So after the meeting, one staffer asked, is the Biden administration asking us to remove books. Or just concerned about the search results in order, or both?Amazon, after the meeting, moved not to promote books questioning the vaccine. So you're not going to find it.Wow. Who is censoring? Who is burning books?Who is silencing people. And the left will just say, well, that's just because it was about the vaccine. Oh, okay.So if you're right, then you're okay with censorship.Because I'm not. I'm not cool with that. I really would love to hear the other side. And how, you know, The Great Reset. And all of the things that are coming out from Klaus Schwab.ESG. Everything else. How that's not true.I would like to read those things. I have read those things.Why are you so afraid, of someone else?   The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy people on the left. The AOC's have taken over, places in the media.And places like this in New York.This is what it is thousand. So there's been one case. One. One in the entire seven years. Where they did this.Where they shut down a company, that had no obvious victims.The case was 1972.And it was a company, relatively small company, that was writing term papers, for college students. Okay.So I want to write my paper.GLENN: I want to break out in God bless America.STU: Capitalism is pretty impressive. Apparently, this didn't go over that well.What they said, there were no obvious victims here. The people bought the term papers. They didn't want to write them. They got the term papers. They said, they were defrauding the education system.GLENN: Which they were.STU: This is the one time. And it's a small tiny company. Let me give you the other times they've done this.Tell me if any of these sound like, hey, I have a good interest rate, on a loan I paid back.Number one, a breast cancer nonprofit was shut down a dozen years ago. For using nearly all its $9 million in donations to pay for director's salaries, perks, and other expenses, instead of funding free mammograms. Okay.So they told everyone, donate money for free. Mammograms. And they just took all the money for themselves.That's number one. Number two, a private equity timber.Faking big investment success, was closed down after stealing millions of dollars from thousands of investors.Okay?You can see.GLENN: Yeah. Got it. But on both of those so far, you have hundreds of thousands of people, you know, I'm sure. That gave -- they're all victims.They gave their money.STU: Yeah. And they didn't get the thing that they want.GLENN: They didn't get the thing they were promised. You have all these people going to the AG. Saying, hey, this is a real problem here. This has to stop. Not here.GLENN: Not here.STU: Another one. Mental health facility, shuttered for looting $4 million from public funds, while neglecting patients.GLENN: Okay. Kind of a big one.STU: Pretty clear. An auto lender that allegedly charged hidden interest rates, got to stay in business last year if it paid a fine and didn't commit fraud in the future.So here's one they didn't shut down.They actually let them go on.They're going after Trump in all of this.

BECKNews_11,"WRITER  Glenn just bought the ENTIRE Roe v. Wade archive from Linda Coffee, the original lawyer behind the landmark abortion case. As a pro-life activist, Glenn doesn't want the lives of the 60 million+ babies who died between Roe v. Wade in 1973 and the Dobbs decision in 2022 to go unforgotten. He purchased the archive so that it wouldn't be treated as a relic of abortion in someone else's collection, but rather as a historical reminder to never sacrifice human life for the sake of freedom EVER again.  But there are two parties in abortion that need to be protected: the baby AND the mother. Glenn wants to honor the mothers who regret their abortions just as much as the babies who lost their lives to the procedure. If YOU had an abortion and regret it, or if you were planning on having an abortion and decided not to, Glenn wants to hear from YOU and honor your story.  If you feel inclined, write your story down on paper, send it to the below P.O. box, and Glenn will include it in his historical vault surrounding the history of abortion. If you would be comfortable with us sharing your story, please sign your name. If you would like to remain anonymous, you can leave your name off of the story. We ask that you include your phone number so that can verify you as a source.       WRITER  Texas is under threat of a George Soros-backed takeover. Soros-funded RINO judges have been elected in some of the highest courts in Texas. These judges implemented restrictions that have blocked nearly a thousand cases of voter fraud from being investigated or prosecuted from across the state. These new restrictions are similar to ones in place in states like George, Arizona, and Wisconsin, leaving Texas more susceptible to election corruption than ever. If Texas falls to corruption, America will lose its largest bastion of conservative electoral power in the nation. Without Texas, Republicans WILL NOT be able to win national elections and liberal corruption will go unchecked across the country.  Fortunately, there is a way to stop this: YOU. If you live in Texas you have a chance to stand up against corruption and to fight back! Starting Tuesday, February 20th, early voting for the primaries begins, where three of these judges are up for election. Go out and vote. If the right people are voted in, there's a good chance the restrictions will be lifted and election fraud can once again be prosecuted.  But remember, you can't just go in and vote for anyone who has an ""R"" next to their name. Sorors knows that a registered Democrat would never stand a chance in Texas, so his lackeys register as Republicans and ride the little ""R"" right into office. So who do you vote for?  Fortunately, Glenn had Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on his show today and Ken gave us his list of judges that he vouches for. His list is as follows:    WRITER  Who is really banning books? For years now, Conservatives have been taking flak from the left for supposed ""book bans."" The left likes to compare these ""bans"" to Nazi book burnings, accusing the right of sweeping authoritarian decrees designed to suppress information. In reality, this is a movement largely motivated by parents, who want to remove inappropriate books from children's libraries.  But if you want to discuss authoritarian book bans, look no further than the White House. As Glenn recently covered, the Biden administration has been pressuring the world's largest bookseller, Amazon, into suppressing books they disagree with. On February 5th, 2024, Ohio Representative Jim Jordan released a slew of subpoenaed documents that exposed pressure placed on Amazon by the Biden Administration. The documents, which Jordan dubbed ""The Amazon Files"" after Elon Musk's ""The Twitter Files,"" revealed an email conversation between Andrew Slavitt, a former White House senior adviser, and Amazon employees. In these emails, Slavitt complained that the top search results for books on ""vaccines"" were ""concerning"" and then requested that Amazon intervene. Amazon initially refused, not out of some altruistic concern for the free exchange of information. They thought any action taken would be ""too visible"" and would further exasperate the ??Harry/Sally narrative,?? referring to the outrage that followed Amazon's removal of Ryan T. Anderson??s book When Harry Became Sally.  Despite this initial refusal, Amazon agreed to meet with the White House a few days later. The number one item on their agenda was""oving books from the website. An Amazon employee even admitted that the reason they even took this meeting was due to the pressure being placed on them by the Biden Administration.  What was the result of this meeting? Amazon caved. They began to implement ways of limiting the outreach of books that challenged the mainstream vaccine narrative and other books the White House might not like. The White House was caught red-handed pressuring the world's largest bookseller to restrict the sale of books they consider in opposition to their narrative, and they have the gall to accuse conservatives of information suppression. This is just ONE of many actions committed by the Biden Administration that are more characteristic of a dictator than a president. What can you do about it? Fortunately, you are not dependent on Amazon and its corrupted algorithm to help you find books. Every week right here on GlennBeck.com, we highlight books that Glenn is reading or talking about in our ""Glenn's Bookshelf"" series. Here you can find a wide selection of books free from Amazon's filters. Be sure to sign up for Glenn's newsletter to find out about new additions to ""Glenn's Bookshelf"" every week.    WRITER   The left-wing media's most recent tirade is accusing Trump of being a dictator. But, as Glenn said, ""Everything they're accusing us of, they're doing."" Since day one, the Biden administration has overstepped the bounds placed on the executive branch set by the Constitution. In Glenn's most recent TV Special, he examined ten times Biden acted like a dictator, NOT a president. Here are 10 of Biden's Dictator Moves, and click HERE to get ALL of the research that went into this week's Glenn TV special:     WRITER   Every day it seems Glenn covers another story revealing how people across the world at all levels of power DESPISE the fact that YOU have rights, and they are actively trying to curtail them. Recently, there has been a string of attacks against the rights outlined in the First Amendment: the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, the freedom of assembly, and the freedom to petition. As a refresher, the First Amendment reads as follows: This is powerful stuff, there is a good reason the Founding Fathers made it the FIRST Amendment. It's also the reason why power-hungry elites are attacking it. These attacks are designed to control the way you think, speak, and believe, vote, what you read, and who holds your representatives responsible. The First Amendment is our strongest weapon against tyrants, and they know it. So what can you do about it? Hope that some wig in Washinton will eventually do something? We know how well that works. The best thing to do is to stay active, engage in the issues you care about, and exercise your rights.  So where to start? Here are a few things YOU can do to protect your First Amendment rights:                                Religion                                   The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is toyou guessed itpractice your faith. Become an active member in your place of worship, go to scripture studies, invite your friends to that late afternoon event, and walk the life. This can impact the way you spend money as well. Shop the businesses and brands that share your values, and don't shop at the ones that scorn them. Keeping the community alive and healthy is the best way to ensure that generations to come will be able to experience the freedom you enjoy.                              Speech                                   Much like religion, the best way to protect your freedom of speech is... to speak. Engage your friends and family in polite, civil conversation. Stand up for what you believe in, and make your case to your peers. Just remember to keep it friendly. No one ever won an argument by shouting down their opponent. The civil exchange of ideas is the cornerstone of our republic, and a dialogue where the participants are well-informed, considerate, compassionate, and open-minded can have permanent impacts on all involved.                              Press                                   Freedom of the Press seems a little tricky at first. Unless you work for the media, what are you supposed to do? Quit your job and go work for the local newspaper? The good news is that exercising this right is not nearly that difficult. In fact, you are currently doing it. The best thing you can do is to read from outlets that produce informative content. Want to know what Glenn consumes to stay informed every day?

Assembly                                    Anna Moneymaker / Staff | Getty ImagesFreedom of assembly is one of the more impactful yet underutilized freedoms in the First Amendment. Peaceably assembling and protesting with like-minded individuals can hugely influence politicians and policies while simultaneously creating community and fellowship between attendees. It's understandable why more people don't turn out. We're all busy people with busy schedules, and flying out to D.C. for the weekend seems like a daunting task to many. Thankfully, you don't have to go out all the way to D.C. to make a difference. Gather some like-minded people in your town and bring awareness to issues that impact your community. Big change starts locally, and exercising your freedom to assemble can be the catalyst to lasting impact.                               Petition                                   If you've been a long-time listener of Glenn, then you will have heard a few of his calls to action where he asks his audience to contact their representatives about a particular piece of policy. There is a good reason Glenn keeps on doing those: they work. Whether it's your local mayor or your senator, a call and an email go a long way. If you really want to make a change, convince your friends and family to reach out as well. The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is to??you guessed it??practice your faith. Become an active member in your place of worship, go to scripture studies, invite your friends to that late afternoon event, and walk the life. This can impact the way you spend money as well. Shop the businesses and brands that share your values, and don't shop at the ones that scorn them. Keeping the community alive and healthy is the best ",-2,,-3
BECKNews_12," The most controversial ad of Super Bowl LVIII was a spot from a group called He Gets Us. The ad featured depictions of Christians washing the feet of a diverse group of people, including a woman in front of an abortion clinic, an illegal immigrant, and a gay man. Many conservative Christians were outraged at this allegedly woke message, which they believe suggests that followers of Jesus are oppressors who should accept sinful behavior. But Glenn has a different take. He believes the ad could have been done better. But he WASNT offended by the ad, and in this clip, he explains why.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: This one is possibly the one causing the most controversy, and it's all coming from the right. Cut three.It is pictures of Christ, washing people's feet. Can you explain. I can't see them from here.PAT: Yeah. It's just a whole bunch of images of people watching other people's feet.GLENN: And they're --PAT: They're normally poor, destitute.GLENN: There's a gas worker. With a hippie.PAT: And somebody's backyard, washing an elderly person.GLENN: A black man sitting on a porch. Washing a white man's feet or vice-versa. Then the last one.PAT: Jesus didn't teach -- he washed feet.GLENN: Yeah.PAT: All right.GLENN: Okay. So stop.So the last one is the controversial one.And some people have a problem. In fact, let me read Steve Deace.Who I really like. I just happened to disagree with him, but that is the glory of TheBlaze.We don't all have to agree, and we don't force each other to agree. You will say yes.No. Yeah. We're against the whole fascistic kind of brainwashing kind of thing.So I was reading a tweet, that -- is that Steve sent out, this morning.And he said, how wrong was the he gets us ad at the Super Bowl.Jesus washed the feet of his disciples, not the multitudes of unrepentant sinners as the ad depicts. Instead, for them, he freely offered himself up as a living sacrifice for their sins, which the ad never points out to them.It affirms -- it, instead, affirms them in their sin. Just a vile, repulsive, heretical, and offensive ad. I can't get upset at Pfizer or Bud Light or anybody else, the spirit of the age. Secrets from his depraved mind.When our answer fundamentally -- mind, when this, our answer, funded by wealthy Christians. It has been 12 hours. And I'm still mad.I -- you know, I -- I kind of disagree.I mean, they didn't -- I think they should have put somebody -- like, the Capitol Police.Washing the feet of those on January 6th.If you're going to have Jesus washing the -- of the foot of transgender. Or you have somebody else.A priest.Washing the feet of the transgender.I get it. I get it.But how about making sure that the left is washing the feet of the right as well. You know what I mean?Because Jesus came for all of us.And the point of this ad.I disagree. I'm not mad at this ad at all.I think it was -- it could have been done better, by really pointing out, our real differences.But Jesus -- let me ask you, Pat.Which one of your children, are you so mad at, you would condemn them to hell.PAT: None of them. No.GLENN: No, no, no.They've done something wrong.Let's say one of them murdered somebody.So you would never want to see them again.Which one?Which one?PAT: It would have to be none of them. None of them.GLENN: But wait. One of them is in BLM. And set fire to cities and stuff. So you will condemn that one to hell, right?PAT: No. No, I'm not.GLENN: Okay.See, the -- we -- Pat told me one time. Just think of God, as a loving father. And you will understand him, and yourself.Much better.And I said, don't think I can do that.And God is everywhere.And in the tree. And I still believe.He is -- he is everywhere.But you can understand him, and your role as a parent. Much better, if you imagine him to be the perfect, loving parent.PAT: Uh-huh.GLENN: He loves all of us!Even the ones who have gone astray.And, yes!He would wash the feet of everyone.Do you think Jesus was embracing adultery, when he road wrote in the sand.And said, where are thine accusers?PAT: He told her not to synonym.That part of the story though is always left out -- by -- by, you know, people trying to condone whatever lifestyle that they think is fine.And that's the problem. That's the --So if that's the point you're trying to make about Jesus. That he condones everything we ever do. That's not right.He still loves us, but he doesn't condone our actions a lot of times.GLENN: Right. Right.God is our father. We are his children.He loves us.The thing that we can learn from that. Is that we cannot hate our fellow man.We cannot hate.And that's the point of this.PAT: Uh-huh.GLENN: We can't hate our enemy.We are not fighting enemies, that are flesh and bone.We are fighting. I actually -- and if you really pray on this. These are not enemies of ours.We don't own these rights.God does.These are enemies of his.And we are supposed to -- we're not the gatekeepersWe're the welcoming committee. And we should be praying for our enemy. And loving our enemy.And that's going to be harder and harder to do.Do you know why Abraham Lincoln was killed by John Wilkes Booth. He tried twice.The first time he was just going to kill him with his bare hands.And it was at the point of the inaugural speech. We have in the vault, the only picture of Abraham Lincoln and John Wilkes Booth in the same photograph. It's an incredible thing.Abraham Lincoln is given the second inaugural address, and he's kind of blurry. And he's talking and moving.And the cameras need long exposure.Up at the top, at the gate of the Capitol. Looking at just his eyes. And everything are so clear.Because he was just boring a hole in Lincoln's head, is John Wilkes Booth.And after Lincoln said, with malice toward none, and charity toward all.Booth about lost his mind. Because he needed the north to hate the south. He needed the south to hate the north.All he -- the only reason why he killed Lincoln was so that the right -- the north would rise up again. In anger, towards the south.That's not Christ-like.We don't -- we -- we should do everything we can. To push our anger aside.It doesn't mean we condone. And it doesn't mean we stop fighting them.We just don't hate.And that's going to -- that's hard. It's because hate is very, very worldly, and hate is what's being pushed right now.   The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy people on the left. The AOC's have taken over, places in the media.And places like this in New York.This is what it is thousand. So there's been one case. One. One in the entire seven years. Where they did this.Where they shut down a company, that had no obvious victims.The case was 1972.And it was a company, relatively small company, that was writing term papers, for college students. Okay.So I want to write my paper.GLENN: I want to break out in God bless America.STU: Capitalism is pretty impressive. Apparently, this didn't go over that well.What they said, there were no obvious victims here. The people bought the term papers. They didn't want to write them. They got the term papers. They said, they were defrauding the education system.GLENN: Which they were.STU: This is the one time. And it's a small tiny company. Let me give you the other times they've done this.Tell me if any of these sound like, hey, I have a good interest rate, on a loan I paid back.Number one, a breast cancer nonprofit was shut down a dozen years ago. For using nearly all its $9 million in donations to pay for director's salaries, perks, and other expenses, instead of funding free mammograms. Okay.So they told everyone, donate money for free. Mammograms. And they just took all the money for themselves.That's number one. Number two, a private equity timber.Faking big investment success, was closed down after stealing millions of dollars from thousands of investors.Okay?You can see.GLENN: Yeah. Got it. But on both of those so far, you have hundreds of thousands of people, you know, I'm sure. That gave -- they're all victims.They gave their money.STU: Yeah. And they didn't get the thing that they want.GLENN: They didn't get the thing they were promised. You have all these people going to the AG. Saying, hey, this is a real problem here. This has to stop. Not here.GLENN: Not here.STU: Another one. Mental health facility, shuttered for looting $4 million from public funds, while neglecting patients.GLENN: Okay. Kind of a big one.STU: Pretty clear. An auto lender that allegedly charged hidden interest rates, got to stay in business last year if it paid a fine and didn't commit fraud in the future.So here's one they didn't shut down.They actually let them go on.They're going after Trump in all of this. In this one, they're like, oh. Sure, they're hidden fees.They're not telling you about them.GLENN: Okay.STU: A judge requested.A judge refused to request to shut down a river rafting company in 2011.After a customer drowned, and the attorney general showed it was repeatedly using unlicensed guides, or none at all.Instead, he ordered only a 50,000-dollar bond and cleanup -- for him to clean up his act.The company is still being run today, under a different name by the same family. Someone died.GLENN: We have thousands of victims.And in this case, somebody who is dead.STU: Is dead!GLENN: Dead!STU: They're like, you guys can stay open -- and then this one is my favorite one. A judge in 2001.Declined to appoint a receiver, to take over a porn site, despite millions of dollars of illegal credit card charges to hundreds of customers.Who thought they were getting a free tour.Now, look, you're -- you want to get the free -- you want to know what you're subscribing for, Glenn. Before you just pulled the trigger on that. So you put your credit card information into a porn site, I think some of these victims need some life changes to be made here.But they put their credit card into a porn site.

BECKNews_13,"WRITER  Glenn has often said that his audience is the most generous in the world, and you have continued that legacy in 2023. From Maui and Afghanistan to Israel and Armenia, this audience has helped countless men, women, and children all over the world. What YOU have done this year through your generosity is, as Glenn says, nothing short of miraculous. Here are ten extraordinary feats made possible by YOU.   Patrick T. Fallon / Contributor | Getty Images This August, horrific wildfires raged across Maui, destroying the historic town of Lahaina along with thousands of acres of forest and claiming more than 100 lives. In response to this tragedy, which is now confirmed to be the deadliest wildfire in U.S. history, Glenn and Mercury One rallied the troops to support the Maui wildfire victims as they begin to heal and rebuild their lives. Through your support, Glenn's audience raised over $1.2 MILLION!   Long-time listeners of Glenn's show are familiar with PreBorn, a paid sponsor of the program. PreBorn is a pro-life organization that helps mothers in crisis pregnancies choose life by introducing them to their babies through free sonograms. Preborn also helps support mothers throughout their pregnancy up to two years after their baby is born. This year alone, PreBorn has saved over 28,000 babies from abortion.   Following Glenn's 40-day series on Biblical covenants, Glenn was inspired to commemorate his series by funding PreBorn for an entire 40 days. Glenn pledged the first $100,000, funding PreBorn for 20 days, and challenged his audience to raise the additional $100,000 for the following 20 days. This audience more than DOUBLED the $200,000 goal, saving thousands of babies and giving mothers hope.   MPI / Stringer | Getty Images Glenn is a collector of all things historical, as his long-time listeners know, and over the years he has amassed an incredible collection of artifacts and documents. Mercury One has started the intensive process of taking high-quality 3D scans of these artifacts to make them available to everyone. This includes invaluable pieces of American history such as the third-largest library of American founding documents, and the largest collection of documents from Jamestown, and the Pilgrims in the world. This is not light work, and it is only made possible with the generosity of Glenn's audience.  - / Contributor | Getty Images On April 30th of this year, Glenn and The Nazarene Fund launched a new mission in Nigeria known as Operation Lego. Operation Lego's primary objective is to collect irrefutable evidence and intelligence to target individuals and rings involved with the illicit trade of organ harvesting, human trafficking, child abduction and exploitation, baby factories, and ritual killings. This work has already led to the arrest of six human traffickers, the rescue and aftercare of 32 children, and the rescue of 15 pregnant women who were continually raped by their captors, who then killed their babies to sell their organs on the black market. This  practice is referred to as ""baby factories,"" and YOUR support is rescuing women and children from this evil industry.   Mohsen Karimi / Contributor | Getty Images Currently, The Nazarene Fund is supporting 125 widows, children, and Christians in hiding within Afghanistan. This monthly support includes food and other necessary supplies. They are also supporting evacuations out of Afghanistan into safehouses in Pakistan, and from there into countries such as Brazil, Mexico, Germany, and Turkey for permanent resettlement. YOUR support has enabled the rescue and resettlement of these Christian families who are under constant threat from the Taliban.   Eyad Baba / Contributor | Getty Images After Hamas' October 7th terrorist attacks, The Nazarene Fund chartered a flight from Tel Aviv to Nashville to bring home US citizens trapped in the country while the Biden administration took weeks to bring American citizens home. The Nazarene Fund also provided funding for the relocation of six Israeli families to the U.S.   Sakis Mitrolidis / Contributor | Getty Images This ongoing outreach is where The Nazarene Fund got its roots. In Syria, the Yazidi people are captured and kept as slaves in a giant prison camp called Al-hol. The Nazarene Fund locates and liberates prisoners from Al-hol and relocates them to Australia and Canada. Just this year alone, 190 people have been rescued from these terrible conditions.  Andrey Borodulin / Contributor | Getty Images Since the conflict in Azerbaijani forces began targeting Armenians in the historically Christian and highly contested Nagorno-Karabakh region in September, Armenians have attempted to flee their historic homeland in droves, fearing for their lives. Over 100,000 people have fled the battlefield and areas of conflict, creating a desperate situation along the Armenian-Azerbaijan border. The Nazarene Fund is on the ground in Armenia assisting Christian families flee the carnage. So far they have successfully evacuated 127 individuals.  Kevin Frayer / Stringer | Getty Images In Asia, The Nazarene Fund has Operation Renaissance, which is dedicated to assisting Christian families and other minority groups with food, medicine, and legal assistance across Asia. Operation Renaissance assisted over 1,590 Christian families fight against persecution and discrimination with cases including but not limited to kidnapping, workplace abuse, and sexual assault.   Express / Stringer | Getty Images With the generosity of this audience, The Nazarene Fund has been able to provide aid and support to people all over the world, including the evacuation of 180 Kurdish workers in June, $200,000 of emergency aid for the victims of the 7.8 magnitude earthquake that rattled Turkey, safe houses for at-risk Yazidi women and their children fathered by ISIS fighters, and protection for former ISIS captives who are witnesses against ISIS for crimes against humanity proceedings.      WRITER  Texas is under threat of a George Soros-backed takeover. Soros-funded RINO judges have been elected in some of the highest courts in Texas. These judges implemented restrictions that have blocked nearly a thousand cases of voter fraud from being investigated or prosecuted from across the state. These new restrictions are similar to ones in place in states like George, Arizona, and Wisconsin, leaving Texas more susceptible to election corruption than ever. If Texas falls to corruption, America will lose its largest bastion of conservative electoral power in the nation. Without Texas, Republicans WILL NOT be able to win national elections and liberal corruption will go unchecked across the country.  Fortunately, there is a way to stop this: YOU. If you live in Texas you have a chance to stand up against corruption and to fight back! Starting Tuesday, February 20th, early voting for the primaries begins, where three of these judges are up for election. Go out and vote. If the right people are voted in, there's a good chance the restrictions will be lifted and election fraud can once again be prosecuted.  But remember, you can't just go in and vote for anyone who has an ""R"" next to their name. Sorors knows that a registered Democrat would never stand a chance in Texas, so his lackeys register as Republicans and ride the little ""R"" right into office. So who do you vote for?  Fortunately, Glenn had Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on his show today and Ken gave us his list of judges that he vouches for. His list is as follows:    WRITER  Who is really banning books? For years now, Conservatives have been taking flak from the left for supposed ""book bans."" The left likes to compare these ""bans"" to Nazi book burnings, accusing the right of sweeping authoritarian decrees designed to suppress information. In reality, this is a movement largely motivated by parents, who want to remove inappropriate books from children's libraries.  But if you want to discuss authoritarian book bans, look no further than the White House. As Glenn recently covered, the Biden administration has been pressuring the world's largest bookseller, Amazon, into suppressing books they disagree with. On February 5th, 2024, Ohio Representative Jim Jordan released a slew of subpoenaed documents that exposed pressure placed on Amazon by the Biden Administration. The documents, which Jordan dubbed ""The Amazon Files"" after Elon Musk's ""The Twitter Files,"" revealed an email conversation between Andrew Slavitt, a former White House senior adviser, and Amazon employees. In these emails, Slavitt complained that the top search results for books on ""vaccines"" were ""concerning"" and then requested that Amazon intervene. Amazon initially refused, not out of some altruistic concern for the free exchange of information. They thought any action taken would be ""too visible"" and would further exasperate the ??Harry/Sally narrative,?? referring to the outrage that followed Amazon's removal of Ryan T. Anderson??s book When Harry Became Sally.  Despite this initial refusal, Amazon agreed to meet with the White House a few days later. The number one item on their agenda was""oving books from the website. An Amazon employee even admitted that the reason they even took this meeting was due to the pressure being placed on them by the Biden Administration.  What was the result of this meeting? Amazon caved. They began to implement ways of limiting the outreach of books that challenged the mainstream vaccine narrative and other books the White House might not like. The White House was caught red-handed pressuring the world's largest bookseller to restrict the sale of books they consider in opposition to their narrative, and they have the gall to accuse conservatives of information suppression. This is just ONE of many actions committed by the Biden Administration that are more characteristic of a dictator than a president. What can you do about it? Fortunately, you are not dependent on Amazon and its corrupted algorithm to help you find books. Every week right here on GlennBeck.com, we highlight books that Glenn is reading or talking about in our ""Glenn's Bookshelf"" series. Here you can find a wide selection of books free from Amazon's filters. Be sure to sign up for Glenn's newsletter to find out about new additions to ""Glenn's Bookshelf"" every week.    WRITER   The left-wing media's most recent tirade is accusing Trump of being a dictator. But, as Glenn said, ""Everything they're accusing us of, they're doing."" Since day one, the Biden administration has overstepped the bounds placed on the executive branch set by the Constitution. In Glenn's most recent TV Special, he examined ten times Biden acted like a dictator, NOT a president. Here are 10 of Biden's Dictator Moves, and click HERE to get ALL of the research that went into this week's Glenn TV special:     WRITER   Every day it seems Glenn covers another story revealing how people across the world at all levels of power DESPISE the fact that YOU have rights, and they are actively trying to curtail them. Recently, there has been a string of attacks against the rights outlined in the First Amendment: the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, the freedom of assembly, and the freedom to petition. As a refresher, the First Amendment reads as follows: This is powerful stuff, there is a good reason the Founding Fathers made it the FIRST Amendment. It's also the reason why power-hungry elites are attacking it. These attacks are designed to control the way you think, speak, and believe, vote, what you read, and who holds your representatives responsible. The First Amendment is our strongest weapon against tyrants, and they know it. So what can you do about it? Hope that some wig in Washinton will eventually do something? We know how well that works. The best thing to do is to stay active, engage in the issues you care about, and exercise your rights.  So where to start? Here are a few things YOU can do to protect your First Amendment rights:                                Religion                                   The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is toyou guessed itpractice your faith. Become an active member in your place of worship, go to scripture studies, invite your friends to that late afternoon event, and walk the life. This can impact the way you spend money as well. Shop the businesses and brands that share your values, and don't shop at the ones that scorn them. Keeping the community alive and healthy is the best way to ensure that generations to come will be able to experience the freedom you enjoy.                              Speech                                   Much like religion, the best way to protect your freedom of speech is... to speak. Engage your friends and family in polite, civil conversation. Stand up for what you believe in, and make your case to your peers. Just remember to keep it friendly. No one ever won an argument by shouting down their opponent. The civil exchange of ideas is the cornerstone of our republic, and a dialogue where the participants are well-informed, considerate, compassionate, and open-minded can have permanent impacts on all involved.                              Press                                   Freedom of the Press seems a little tricky at first. Unless you work for the media, what are you supposed to do? Quit your job and go work for the local newspaper? The good news is that exercising this right is not nearly that difficult. In fact, you are currently doing it. The best thing you can do is to read from outlets that produce informative content. Want to know what Glenn consumes to stay informed every day?

Assembly                                    Anna Moneymaker / Staff | Getty ImagesFreedom of assembly is one of the more impactful yet underutilized freedoms in the First Amendment. Peaceably assembling and protesting with like-minded individuals can hugely influence politicians and policies while simultaneously creating community and fellowship between attendees. It's understandable why more people don't turn out. We're all busy people with busy schedules, and flying out to D.C. for the weekend seems like a daunting task to many. Thankfully, you don't have to go out all the way to D.C. to make a difference. Gather some like-minded people in your town and bring awareness to issues that impact your community. Big change starts locally, and exercising your freedom to assemble can be the catalyst to lasting impact.                               Petition                                   If you've been a long-time listener of Glenn, then you will have heard a few of his calls to action where he asks his audience to contact their representatives about a particular piece of policy. There is a good reason Glenn keeps on doing those: they work. Whether it's your local mayor or your senator, a call and an email go a long way. If you really want to make a change, convince your friends and family to reach out as well. The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is to??you guessed it??practice your faith.

BECKNews_14," 	CEO/Founder    	This month has already produced an extreme example of why we need a functional and more conservative Congress in order for America to have a chance at moving forwardbecause the Left does not believe in the Constitution.   	Sure, if you confronted a Democrat in Congress, they would probably claim some sort of allegiance to the Constitutionbut as a practical matter, they do not believe in it.   	Instead, the Left has put all of their eggs in the basket of the executive branch.  Why?  Because it has the furthest reach through all the various departments, and it can move the fastestin short, because its the most dictatorial.  It only takes a department head to write a new memo, or even better, the President to sign a new executive order to carry the force of law.   	Do you recall any of the Lefts favorite Supreme Court decisions over the yearssomething like gay marriage for exampleand how Republicans immediately tried to subvert it, using the executive branch to try to nullify the decision?  Yeah, that never happened.  But that is exactly what Democrats have done in recent weeks to expand abortion access.   	Democrats only consider the Supreme Court legitimate when they approve of the decisions.  When the miraculous overturning of Roe v. Wade happened last summer, President Biden called it ??a realization of an extreme ideology and a tragic error by the Supreme Court.??    	Recently the FDA approved local pharmacies to issue abortion pills.  For the first 20 years after these pills were develop"" they were not treated like typical prescription drugs.  They had to be dispensed in-person by a doctor.  That in-person requirement is now gone.   	Keep in mind that the Left??s go-to line is that abortion is always about the health and safety of women, yet a 2021 peer-reviewed study found that chemical abortions have a complication rate four times greater than surgical abortions.  Between 2002 and 2015, the rate of abortion-related ER visits following use of the abortion pills increased by 507 percent.   	And now the Biden administration is making these less-safe abortions much more accessible.  Thanks to the FDA??s rule change, Walgreens and CVS have already agreed to dispense abortion pills in states where abortion is legal??effectively turning these stores into new abortion clinics.   	As for states that have abortion bans, ""m Biden"" announced a new way around those too.  Three weeks ago, the Justice Department issued a legal opinion that the U.S. Postal Service is allowed to deliver abortion pills anywhere, even in places where abortion is illegal.  Whats their rationale?  That the sender cannot know for sure whether the recipient will use the pills illegally or not.  So its totally okay.   	Georgetown Law professor Lawrence Gostin told the Washington Post that this Justice Department opinion is a major expansion of abortion access in the United States.   	So, to recapthe Biden administration has used the FDA, the Justice Department, and the Post Office, which all fall under the executive branch, to provide an end-run around the Supreme Courts Dobbs v. Jackson decision.   	Expanding abortion was easysimple policy tweaks and declarations that carry the force of law without an ounce of input from actual lawmakers in Congressall because it comes from the grotesque, bloated, apparently pro-death executive branch.

BECKNews_15," South Carolina Senator Tim Scott has made a name for himself in Congress by challenging the narratives. For instance, he argues that ??ALL Americans are privileged,""and in this episode, he explains how his personal journey to Washington, D.C., proves it. Now, he's running for president to stop the Left from changing that. He and Glenn discuss how socialism is destroying impoverished communities and fueling the true afflictions of black America. Plus, he reveals the ""disgusting racism"" he has experienced from ""modern plantation owners"" on the Left. Senator Scott lays out his stance on funding Ukraine in its war against Russia and the fight to end abortion. And he does a deep dive into the head-spinning math of America??s national debt. But ultimately, he tells Glenn, America is a land of hope. Why else would China be trying to sell the idea that our decline is irreversible? Sen. Scott also lays out his plan to make it to the top of the GOP ticket. This episode of ""he Glenn Beck Podcast"" is part of a series leading up to the 2024 presidential election season. These interviews come with no agenda, and the purpose of them is to ask important questions that the American people deserve to have answered.      The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy people on the left. The AOC's have taken over, places in the media.And places like this in New York.This is what it is thousand. So there's been one case. One. One in the entire seven years. Where they did this.Where they shut down a company, that had no obvious victims.The case was 1972.And it was a company, relatively small company, that was writing term papers, for college students. Okay.So I want to write my paper.GLENN: I want to break out in God bless America.STU: Capitalism is pretty impressive. Apparently, this didn't go over that well.What they said, there were no obvious victims here. The people bought the term papers. They didn't want to write them. They got the term papers. They said, they were defrauding the education system.GLENN: Which they were.STU: This is the one time. And it's a small tiny company. Let me give you the other times they've done this.Tell me if any of these sound like, hey, I have a good interest rate, on a loan I paid back.Number one, a breast cancer nonprofit was shut down a dozen years ago. For using nearly all its $9 million in donations to pay for director's salaries, perks, and other expenses, instead of funding free mammograms. Okay.So they told everyone, donate money for free. Mammograms. And they just took all the money for themselves.That's number one. Number two, a private equity timber.Faking big investment success, was closed down after stealing millions of dollars from thousands of investors.Okay?You can see.GLENN: Yeah. Got it. But on both of those so far, you have hundreds of thousands of people, you know, I'm sure. That gave -- they're all victims.They gave their money.STU: Yeah. And they didn't get the thing that they want.GLENN: They didn't get the thing they were promised. You have all these people going to the AG. Saying, hey, this is a real problem here. This has to stop. Not here.GLENN: Not here.STU: Another one. Mental health facility, shuttered for looting $4 million from public funds, while neglecting patients.GLENN: Okay. Kind of a big one.STU: Pretty clear. An auto lender that allegedly charged hidden interest rates, got to stay in business last year if it paid a fine and didn't commit fraud in the future.So here's one they didn't shut down.They actually let them go on.They're going after Trump in all of this. In this one, they're like, oh. Sure, they're hidden fees.They're not telling you about them.GLENN: Okay.STU: A judge requested.A judge refused to request to shut down a river rafting company in 2011.After a customer drowned, and the attorney general showed it was repeatedly using unlicensed guides, or none at all.Instead, he ordered only a 50,000-dollar bond and cleanup -- for him to clean up his act.The company is still being run today, under a different name by the same family. Someone died.GLENN: We have thousands of victims.And in this case, somebody who is dead.STU: Is dead!GLENN: Dead!STU: They're like, you guys can stay open -- and then this one is my favorite one. A judge in 2001.Declined to appoint a receiver, to take over a porn site, despite millions of dollars of illegal credit card charges to hundreds of customers.Who thought they were getting a free tour.Now, look, you're -- you want to get the free -- you want to know what you're subscribing for, Glenn. Before you just pulled the trigger on that. So you put your credit card information into a porn site, I think some of these victims need some life changes to be made here.But they put their credit card into a porn site. Expecting a free tour.They instead, get charged and charged and charged and charged.In fact, once the owners of the site were caught, they attempted to move their money overseas, to avoid any penalty.Still, the judge said, appointing a receiver was an extraordinary remedy!That should be used sparingly, and that a preliminary injunction was good enough.Only after all that happened, it they find out, the people running the porn site, were the Gambino crime family.(laughter)I kid you not. The Gambino crime family.GLENN: And they didn't go into receivership.STU: So there you go. Think about that.I mean, it's so obvious, what they're doing. Latitia james talked about it when she ran.Her goal was to take this one individual out.And the New York -- the voters of New York, said, good.Go do it.And now she's doing it.GLENN: Okay. If you are -- if you have business in in New York, if you're in New York, I'm just telling you. You have to do what you have to do.There's no way, I would keep my business in New York.There is no rule of law now. You know it on the streets. But there is no rule of law. If they can get away with this. They can do anything to you.   Elon Musk has announced that the first Neuralink patient can now control a computer mouse by just thinking. But while this technology could help a lot of people, should we proceed with caution? Between AI and this new merger of man and machine, Glenn gives a warning about what the future could hold. Glenn and Stu also review the controversy surrounding Googles Gemini AI, which refused to generate images of white people.     Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: So the website, Down Detector, detected a surge in outage reports from users at AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Customer Cellular, Boost Mobile, US Cellular, and Straight Talk.That the reports of the system being downed or outages, began at 3:45 a.m. Eastern time. The outages have been reported across many major US cities.It looks like, that it is back up. I'm not sure.They say, they don't think this was a cyber attack.But how did all of them go down at the same time?I mean, that's kind of weird.Yesterday, Israel had a cyber attack.It was from Iran. The Israelis say. And it was an attack on their cell phone services.So quite a coincidence. But let's not jump to any conclusions. Let's see what actually happened.Cyber attacks are going to happen. At some point, soon. We will have cyber attacks. And it will leave you vulnerable, if that's what you depend on.We are becoming more and more, a society that is connected in all things, and absolutely incapable of doing any things, without our electronics.We hit a milestone yesterday. This is truly like landing a man on the moon, I think. This is -- this is the first real merging of man and machine, I think. I mean, we've had the electronic. You know, the bionic arms and things like that.But this is in your mind.It's Neuralink. Elon Musk came up with it. And it is really tempting, because this is -- you know, this will be great to some degree. You'll be able to access information, and have the old internet in your head. You want to speak French?Okay. Download it. Got it.I mean, it is really -- isn't that the Matrix?STU: Yeah. The Matrix too. We're turning into The Matrix. That's the theme of the show today. GLENN: So that is now the beginnings of that, happened and was announced yesterday. Elon Musk said, Neuralink is active in the first person, to have one of the chips implanted in their brain. They have seemingly made a full recovery.We -- you know, so far. We don't know what the effects of this are, or will be. But Musk said, the patient can now move the mouse around a screen, just by thinking.So he has Bluetoothed himself to the screen.Crazy. Huh.STU: It's incredible that they can do that. And, you know, also, look at the way Elon Musk does business.This is a lot of what he does. Which is a lot of kind of just -- let's try it. There's a lot of -- hey, let's give it a whirl.GLENN: He said I think yesterday or earlier this week, that he had plans by 2029, to have a million people on Mars.And when I heard that, I thought, there's no -- oh, it's Elon Musk. Maybe.STU: Well, yeah. And this is his goal, with all of this stuff. He has -- I think it's a T-shirt or something. He wears. Like occupy mars.This is the central idea of his life.GLENN: And this is part of it. Neuralink is part of it.He believes that we are on such a dystopian track right now. That because of global warming, but also because of AI.He believes AI is just as dangerous as global warming. He believes we cannot compete with AI.Unless we can merge with it. Okay.Because it will be operating at such high speeds. We don't have the processing capabilities for the speeds.You know, it's kind of like -- kind of like dogs. Dog life. Seven years. One year for us.It's like one year is a thousand years for AI.So it's moving at such a rapid speed, we won't be able to keep up. So he believes that we need to be able to merge with the machine, until we can get off, this planet.I don't think he'll be taking Neuralink with him. Or maybe he just thinks we won't have access to this AI on Mars.But that's really what is -- is driving him. Driving his whole life.STU: It's really, really hard.Because I know, it feels creepy. And there are risks. And all of that.But it's like, it's really, really hard to think about telling someone, who is paralyzed that, no. We could make you move. But we don't want to pursue that technology.Like, I don't know. I mean, it's just -- it's such incredible technology.And for all of the other stuff, that he's done. Which is really impressive. I mean, Elon Musk is an impressive dude.Space travel. You know, the electric car stuff. I don't care about the electric car stuff that much. But it's still really impressive what he's been able to do.Everyone basically said, you couldn't do it. And no other company could be able to do that. He did that. He's done so many incredible things. But if he was able to take people, you know, with disabilities. And all these -- these issues that have been unsolvable throughout all of human history, and somehow figure out a way to -- through Neuralink or something similar, to solve that for people, it would be the greatest thing he has ever accomplished by a long shot.GLENN: So my daughter Mary had brain surgery, about three, four years ago.STU: Yeah. I remember.GLENN: And it was perfect for a long time.All of her seizures went away. Earlier this year, I think it was in the summer, she started to have breakthrough seizures.And they are even on medication now, they are grand mal. They are --STU: Hmm.GLENN: They're just terrifying. And -- and I said to her, this was about four years ago.I said, honey, if you wait. Elon Musk is doing experience with Neuralink.And one of the things that Neuralink will do. Is it will -- you know, patch all of the brain damage.It will take where -- when you have a stroke, it's like a highway.And there's you all these highways running to different parts of your brain. And if you have a stroke, that highway is cut.So there are other paths to get to where it's going, but it makes it much slower. And sometimes it can't just get to where it's supposed to go.STU: You can't get there from here.GLENN: You can't get there from here.So Neuralink will connect the different parts of the brain, back to each other.And it doesn't need roadway. It's just Bluetooth to all the different parts of the brain, it needs.In effect --STU: Incredible.GLENN: Yeah. Incredible. Absolutely incredible.You know what she said to me.Dad, I think I'll wait.Because I know the savior will heal me, even if it's just in the afterlife.STU: Jeez.GLENN: What a giant.STU: Raised a good kid there, jeez.GLENN: I had nothing to do with it. Nothing to do with it.STU: That's incredible.GLENN: So we have this now. We have what I've been talking about, the singularity, the merging of man and machine. And also, what I've been talking -- I've been talking about this particular category for 30 years, plus. And I said, there's going to come a time, merging man and machine. There's also going to come a time, where you cannot believe your eyes or your ears. We're there now. Did you hear about -- what was her name.Bobbi Althoff. Did you read about this? Bobbi Althoff, apparently, a very sexually explicit video of -- she's a podcast person. Spread on X, all day y",-7,,-8
BECKNews_16," Florida Governor Ron DeSantis gained national attention when he declared war on wokeism in his state. But would his strategies be as effective if he were president? Glenn sits down with Gov. DeSantis to get the answers Americans want most about his 2024 presidential campaign. How would he handle a government shutdown debate? How would he address the border crisis? What would be his first priority on day one? Would he clean out the Deep State? What does he actually believe about the war in Ukraine? DeSantis explains how he plans to reverse the Biden administration's destructive policies and give power back to the states, especially when it comes to the border. He also responds to former President Donald Trump's criticism of Florida's heartbeat bill and clarifies his own stance on abortion. Plus, he shares the other thing he believes Biden should be impeached over. This episode of ""The Glenn Beck Podcast"" is part of a series leading up to the 2024 election. These interviews come with no agenda. The point is to ask all of the candidates all the questions that people need to ask.     The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy people on the left. The AOC's have taken over, places in the media.And places like this in New York.This is what it is thousand. So there's been one case. One. One in the entire seven years. Where they did this.Where they shut down a company, that had no obvious victims.The case was 1972.And it was a company, relatively small company, that was writing term papers, for college students. Okay.So I want to write my paper.GLENN: I want to break out in God bless America.STU: Capitalism is pretty impressive. Apparently, this didn't go over that well.What they said, there were no obvious victims here. The people bought the term papers. They didn't want to write them. They got the term papers. They said, they were defrauding the education system.GLENN: Which they were.STU: This is the one time. And it's a small tiny company. Let me give you the other times they've done this.Tell me if any of these sound like, hey, I have a good interest rate, on a loan I paid back.Number one, a breast cancer nonprofit was shut down a dozen years ago. For using nearly all its $9 million in donations to pay for director's salaries, perks, and other expenses, instead of funding free mammograms. Okay.So they told everyone, donate money for free. Mammograms. And they just took all the money for themselves.That's number one. Number two, a private equity timber.Faking big investment success, was closed down after stealing millions of dollars from thousands of investors.Okay?You can see.GLENN: Yeah. Got it. But on both of those so far, you have hundreds of thousands of people, you know, I'm sure. That gave -- they're all victims.They gave their money.STU: Yeah. And they didn't get the thing that they want.GLENN: They didn't get the thing they were promised. You have all these people going to the AG. Saying, hey, this is a real problem here. This has to stop. Not here.GLENN: Not here.STU: Another one. Mental health facility, shuttered for looting $4 million from public funds, while neglecting patients.GLENN: Okay. Kind of a big one.STU: Pretty clear. An auto lender that allegedly charged hidden interest rates, got to stay in business last year if it paid a fine and didn't commit fraud in the future.So here's one they didn't shut down.They actually let them go on.They're going after Trump in all of this. In this one, they're like, oh. Sure, they're hidden fees.They're not telling you about them.GLENN: Okay.STU: A judge requested.A judge refused to request to shut down a river rafting company in 2011.After a customer drowned, and the attorney general showed it was repeatedly using unlicensed guides, or none at all.Instead, he ordered only a 50,000-dollar bond and cleanup -- for him to clean up his act.The company is still being run today, under a different name by the same family. Someone died.GLENN: We have thousands of victims.And in this case, somebody who is dead.STU: Is dead!GLENN: Dead!STU: They're like, you guys can stay open -- and then this one is my favorite one. A judge in 2001.Declined to appoint a receiver, to take over a porn site, despite millions of dollars of illegal credit card charges to hundreds of customers.Who thought they were getting a free tour.Now, look, you're -- you want to get the free -- you want to know what you're subscribing for, Glenn. Before you just pulled the trigger on that. So you put your credit card information into a porn site, I think some of these victims need some life changes to be made here.But they put their credit card into a porn site. Expecting a free tour.They instead, get charged and charged and charged and charged.In fact, once the owners of the site were caught, they attempted to move their money overseas, to avoid any penalty.Still, the judge said, appointing a receiver was an extraordinary remedy!That should be used sparingly, and that a preliminary injunction was good enough.Only after all that happened, it they find out, the people running the porn site, were the Gambino crime family.(laughter)I kid you not. The Gambino crime family.GLENN: And they didn't go into receivership.STU: So there you go. Think about that.I mean, it's so obvious, what they're doing. Latitia james talked about it when she ran.Her goal was to take this one individual out.And the New York -- the voters of New York, said, good.Go do it.And now she's doing it.GLENN: Okay. If you are -- if you have business in in New York, if you're in New York, I'm just telling you. You have to do what you have to do.There's no way, I would keep my business in New York.There is no rule of law now. You know it on the streets. But there is no rule of law. If they can get away with this. They can do anything to you.   Elon Musk has announced that the first Neuralink patient can now control a computer mouse by just thinking. But while this technology could help a lot of people, should we proceed with caution? Between AI and this new merger of man and machine, Glenn gives a warning about what the future could hold. Glenn and Stu also review the controversy surrounding Googles Gemini AI, which refused to generate images of white people.     Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: So the website, Down Detector, detected a surge in outage reports from users at AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Customer Cellular, Boost Mobile, US Cellular, and Straight Talk.That the reports of the system being downed or outages, began at 3:45 a.m. Eastern time. The outages have been reported across many major US cities.It looks like, that it is back up. I'm not sure.They say, they don't think this was a cyber attack.But how did all of them go down at the same time?I mean, that's kind of weird.Yesterday, Israel had a cyber attack.It was from Iran. The Israelis say. And it was an attack on their cell phone services.So quite a coincidence. But let's not jump to any conclusions. Let's see what actually happened.Cyber attacks are going to happen. At some point, soon. We will have cyber attacks. And it will leave you vulnerable, if that's what you depend on.We are becoming more and more, a society that is connected in all things, and absolutely incapable of doing any things, without our electronics.We hit a milestone yesterday. This is truly like landing a man on the moon, I think. This is -- this is the first real merging of man and machine, I think. I mean, we've had the electronic. You know, the bionic arms and things like that.But this is in your mind.It's Neuralink. Elon Musk came up with it. And it is really tempting, because this is -- you know, this will be great to some degree. You'll be able to access information, and have the old internet in your head. You want to speak French?Okay. Download it. Got it.I mean, it is really -- isn't that the Matrix?STU: Yeah. The Matrix too. We're turning into The Matrix. That's the theme of the show today. GLENN: So that is now the beginnings of that, happened and was announced yesterday. Elon Musk said, Neuralink is active in the first person, to have one of the chips implanted in their brain. They have seemingly made a full recovery.We -- you know, so far. We don't know what the effects of this are, or will be. But Musk said, the patient can now move the mouse around a screen, just by thinking.So he has Bluetoothed himself to the screen.Crazy. Huh.STU: It's incredible that they can do that. And, you know, also, look at the way Elon Musk does business.This is a lot of what he does. Which is a lot of kind of just -- let's try it. There's a lot of -- hey, let's give it a whirl.GLENN: He said I think yesterday or earlier this week, that he had plans by 2029, to have a million people on Mars.And when I heard that, I thought, there's no -- oh, it's Elon Musk. Maybe.STU: Well, yeah. And this is his goal, with all of this stuff. He has -- I think it's a T-shirt or something. He wears. Like occupy mars.This is the central idea of his life.GLENN: And this is part of it. Neuralink is part of it.He believes that we are on such a dystopian track right now. That because of global warming, but also because of AI.He believes AI is just as dangerous as global warming. He believes we cannot compete with AI.Unless we can merge with it. Okay.Because it will be operating at such high speeds. We don't have the processing capabilities for the speeds.You know, it's kind of like -- kind of like dogs. Dog life. Seven years. One year for us.It's like one year is a thousand years for AI.So it's moving at such a rapid speed, we won't be able to keep up. So he believes that we need to be able to merge with the machine, until we can get off, this planet.I don't think he'll be taking Neuralink with him. Or maybe he just thinks we won't have access to this AI on Mars.But that's really what is -- is driving him. Driving his whole life.STU: It's really, really hard.Because I know, it feels creepy. And there are risks. And all of that.But it's like, it's really, really hard to think about telling someone, who is paralyzed that, no. We could make you move. But we don't want to pursue that technology.Like, I don't know. I mean, it's just -- it's such incredible technology.And for all of the other stuff, that he's done. Which is really impressive. I mean, Elon Musk is an impressive dude.Space travel. You know, the electric car stuff. I don't care about the electric car stuff that much. But it's still really impressive what he's been able to do.Everyone basically said, you couldn't do it. And no other company could be able to do that. He did that. He's done so many incredible things. But if he was able to take people, you know, with disabilities. And all these -- these issues that have been unsolvable throughout all of human history, and somehow figure out a way to -- through Neuralink or something similar, to solve that for people, it would be the greatest thing he has ever accomplished by a long shot.GLENN: So my daughter Mary had brain surgery, about three, four years ago.STU: Yeah. I remember.GLENN: And it was perfect for a long time.All of her seizures went away. Earlier this year, I think it was in the summer, she started to have breakthrough seizures.And they are even on medication now, they are grand mal. They are --STU: Hmm.GLENN: They're just terrifying. And -- and I said to her, this was about four years ago.I said, honey, if you wait. Elon Musk is doing experience with Neuralink.And one of the things that Neuralink will do. Is it will -- you know, patch all of the brain damage.It will take where -- when you have a stroke, it's like a highway.And there's you all these highways running to different parts of your brain. And if you have a stroke, that highway is cut.So there are other paths to get to where it's going, but it makes it much slower. And sometimes it can't just get to where it's supposed to go.STU: You can't get there from here.GLENN: You can't get there from here.So Neuralink will connect the different parts of the brain, back to each other.And it doesn't need roadway. It's just Bluetooth to all the different parts of the brain, it needs.In effect --STU: Incredible.GLENN: Yeah. Incredible. Absolutely incredible.You know what she said to me.Dad, I think I'll wait.Because I know the savior will heal me, even if it's just in the afterlife.STU: Jeez.GLENN: What a giant.STU: Raised a good kid there, jeez.GLENN: I had nothing to do with it. Nothing to do with it.STU: That's incredible.GLENN: So we have this now. We have what I've been talking about, the singularity, the merging of man and machine. And also, what I've been talking -- I've been talking about this particular category for 30 years, plus. And I said, there's going to come a time, merging man and machine. There's also going to come a time, where you cannot believe your eyes or your ears. We're there now. Did you hear about -- what was her name.Bobbi Althoff. Did you read about this? Bobbi Althoff, apparently, a very sexually explicit video of -- she's a podcast person. Spread on X, all day yesterday.This was -- they tried to get it down as fast as they can. But it was jus",-8,,-9
BECKNews_17," California Governor Gavin Newsom has chosen radical pro-abortion activist Laphonza Butler to serve out the rest of the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein's term. But there's just one issue: While she checks many of the boxes progressives love  black, female, LGBTQ+  she currently lives in Maryland. Glenn and Stu discuss what that means for Californians and how crazy it is that Democrats are (once again) openly considering an applicant's skin color.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Now, I want to talk to you about the G.O.P.There is a great, great article that is coming from the -- the Blaze.The G.O.P. is the problem.It's spot-on.We have Chip Roy coming up in just a little whale.Stand by for that. Because we will talk about, what did we get? What are we doing?What are we it doing right now?But first, before we go there, I really want to congratulate Gavin Newsom.He has picked a new senator for California. And it's odd, because she doesn't live in California.She lives in Maryland.But, I mean, that's close, right?STU: Right around the corner.GLENN: Right around the corner.It's practically California.And it's Laphonza Butler. And I know what you're thinking. I know what you're thinking.He said, that he was going to pick a black person, to replace --STU: A woman.GLENN: Right. Right.A black woman. Thank you for correcting. STU: Thank you. In putting a black male into that role, would be disgusting.It would be a hat tip -- a hat tip to the patriarchy.GLENN: Yeah. Amen. Now, you pointing that out, pretty much makes you racist.(music)STU: I forgot.(music)GLENN: Yeah. Your white supremacist thoughts there, Stu, will get you into trouble.Now, sure, she lives in another state, okay?But she has a house in California. It's not her primary. She's registered to vote in Maryland. STU: No. Real woman of the people.GLENN: Yeah. But she has a house there.STU: As most people do. Do you have houses on both coasts?GLENN: It's like me, running for governor in Idaho.I have a house in Idaho.STU: There you go.GLENN: I am one with the people.STU: You sure are.GLENN: Absolutely I am.Anyway, some might also point out, that hmm.She also is -- she also is somebody who runs, an abortion -- a really big abortion mill strokes.STU: An abortion hut?GLENN: Yeah. And this abortion advocacy group, Emily -- Emily's List. Is very, very powerful in Washington.STU: Very powerful, yes.GLENN: Very, very powerful.STU: And she's also a former union --GLENN: Another very, very powerful thing.STU: It's the almost like -- I'll just throw this out. This is silly. This is a hypothetical. But let's say, you were planning a future run for president, and an activist behind your campaign. You might want to pick an incredibly powerful activist.GLENN: Oh, my God. No, Stu! That's racist. You're pointing this out. Only a racist would see it that way. Oh.STU: Can I ask you a question?GLENN: Yeah. Honest question. When did this start?When -- when was the first time that a politician overtly said, in advance, they will only consider a black woman for a role?When did that start?Because that is, to me, I think super recent.Now, this used to be -- it used to actually be reality. Right?Politicians would get a job. Right? And they would say, okay.Well, let's -- we want to appeal to this constituency. And they would come out and they would say, you know, we wanted to find the most qualified person in the whole wide world. And we found that person, who happens to have every characteristic of the voting base I'm trying to court. That did happen. But no one overtly said it. GLENN: Well, I think Obama -- Obama definitely said it for the Supreme Court. STU: Obama did? I don't remember that. GLENN: Really?STU: I think it started with Joe Biden. I think Joe Biden was the first one to do it. That's my theory. I think Joe Biden came out and said, you know what, I will only consider a black woman for this role.I don't remember anyone overtly saying, in advance, before that.GLENN: There's two portions of this. When did it become okay. Just to say, I'm appointing a black woman? For the role?That's what I'm looking for.And erase -- I'm sure there's a polyamorous Asian out in California, that might have been -- that lives in California. That might be very qualified.STU: It's one of the first qualifications, living in the state, usually.GLENN: Yeah. It is. It is.But, anyway, there's also, you're racist for even thinking that that's not okay.STU: That's true.That's a whole other glass ceiling.GLENN: But they have to have both of them.STU: Yeah.GLENN: And I think that started with me.I think that started --STU: You started this?GLENN: No. No. I didn't start it. They started it me. When I said, I think Barack Obama might be racist.Or he has a deep-seated hatred for the white culture.STU: I remember this.GLENN: I remember it too.Like a brand.Anyway, and I couldn't believe that -- I remember we said, when -- when was the first time, somebody was pointing out racism was called a racist! Remember?STU: That's true.I don't remember that ever happening before you. People like Al Sharpton would throw up racist all the time.But nobody would say, he was a racist for saying that he was a racist.That's usually a claim you would make.But that was you. That was how you treated it with him.Because you said he was racist. Now you are a racist.GLENN: Now everybody does that.Everybody, when they want to shut you down. They say, you're a racist for saying this is racist.STU: I don't want to say it. But trailblazer?GLENN: Well, I don't like that.STU: Congratulations.GLENN: Thank you. Thank you. Very much. I appreciate the honor.STU: And on the other side of it. I really -- I glance to find another example of this. Before Joe Biden.But people like to say, Reagan said in a debate, like he said, I look forward -- he said, I look forward to naming the first female Supreme Court justice.It wasn't like, I will only look at females for this role.It was -- a little more explicit than normal. Maybe.And then it was Joe Biden.Joe Biden came out. Did it 57 times.He's like, I want a guy who is actually saying he's a girl for this role. I want a black woman for this role.I want three lesbians over there.Nine -- like that's all he started with.But he did it -- the first time he did it, was in that debate. Remember this? He was in a debate.And he -- it was -- it was -- well, fascinating. And this might be why we never really had a conversation about it.But it was March, I think 15th. 2020.So, I mean, like we were thinking of other things, that week.You know. I believe the next day, was the 15 days to start the spread.Slow the spread. When we started that. We never really had a conversation with that. He kind of blurted it out.All the reporting behind the scenes. Is that Clyburn, who basically handed them the Democratic nomination.GLENN: I remember now.STU: Yeah! Went on stage, in a commercial break.And threatened to say it on stage. Just say, no. You can be explicit about it. Say, it's a black woman for this role.Right?GLENN: I remember that!STU: Yes. And we never really talked about how all of a sudden it was okay to admit, you were picking people based on the color of their skin.Now, in 1905, it happened all the time.In 1739, it probably was pretty common.But we all think that's bad. Right?We all think picking people by skin color was a really bad idea.GLENN: Well, I think the transgender Latinx, who were left off that list.Is probably thinking it was a bad thing.STU: Yeah, I'm glad you finally brought up that.GLENN: And isn't it interesting, it was the white guys. The white guys who were leading the way.You know what, I'm really old.I'm out of step.I do think my radio is called the wireless. But I'm going to do what we used to do, when I was a kid, back in the aughts, right after the turn of the century of the 1800s, turn of the 1900s. And I will look for a specific race, and make sure that I'm checking their bedroom as well.STU: Hmm.GLENN: I mean, these white guys, why don't you get out of the way. Why don't you -- Joe, if you believe this, why don't you retire right now, and let Kamala Harris be our first black female president? STU: Of course not.GLENN: Yeah. Of course not. Of course not. Of course not.But they'll make sure that everybody else gives up their power. That's kind of the point, isn't it? Kind of the point.STU: And this goes also to -- in the same period, right? This is the George Floyd period, that happens a few months after he says that.And that report of just six percent of new S&P 500 jobs, went to white applicants in the wake of the George Floyd crisis, which is remarkable.I mean, white people make up, what? 70 percent of this country. Only 6 percent of these jobs. That is just blatant racism. Right?I mean, it's -- now, look, I mean, maybe -- you want to give me the argument. That suddenly, only minorities were good at jobs at big companies. You can make the argument. I can certainly make the argument in the NBA.GLENN: I am going to show you. I am going to show you, how in real life, with companies that you know. How this turns out in 60 seconds. Or right after the commercial break. Stand by. First, here's a number that should shock you right now. Over 38,000 veterans, experiencing homelessness.38,000 US veterans on the streets. The people who signed up to protect and serve us. These are the people living on the streets. Living under bridges. Lacking the basics that you and I enjoy. The Tunnel2Towers Foundation are committed to helping these people who have sacrificed so much to help our country and our freedom.For us! The homeless veterans program from Tunnel2Towers is providing housing assistance and services to vets who meet the program's requirements. Last year, they helped 500 veterans. This year the number is expected to be over 2,000.But we cannot just turn a blind aye to the honorable, and those who served our nation, honorably.If you or somebody knows a veteran who is homeless. Or at risk of homelessness.Please, complete the foundation's entry form at T2T.org.That's T2T.org. If you're someone who can help Tunnel2Towers make a difference, please do.Please. Thirty-eight thousand of our brothers and sisters need it desperately. You can help by donating $11 a month at Tunnel2Towers. At T2T.org.And if you know a homeless veteran, please let them know. At T2T.org.(music)(OUT AT 8:50 AM)GLENN: Welcome to the Glenn Beck Program.Now, I know I was supposed to talk to you about something. But Stu and I got sidetracked about Tom Hanks. Oh, I remember.Now, here's what happens. I'm talking to a friend of mine the other day. And he told me about somebody who works at Disney. And they -- they're in charge of fiscal responsibility, and everything else, for all these movies.And they were told, that on this project, you need to hire a black person to fill this role.I remember what role it was, but it was a big role. And literally, this woman said, there is only one African-American in the entire industry, that does that. And they -- it's -- it's an important role. Or everything could go to hell in a handbasket. They said, we don't care. Get a -- an accountant to do the job. And they're like, but it's not the job of an accountant.An accountant can't do this job.They're like, get a black accountant and do it.They're going to lose all kinds of money. They have a chance, that it's an absolute flop.This is why Disney is going to sell off everything.They're going to -- they've destroyed their movie business.They're destroying their parks.Because they can't stop now. The -- the inmates are in charge of the asylum. And they can't stop. They built it. That's what you get. Congratulations, Disney.   The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there.

Apparently, this didn't go over that well.What they said, there were no obvious victims here. The people bought the term papers. They didn't want to write them. They got the term papers. They said, they were defrauding the education system.GLENN: Which they were.STU: This is the one time. And it's a small tiny company.

BECKNews_18," Glenn has been bashing the corruption and deceit within the Biden family??and how they are NOT being held accountable. When you??ve been in politics as long as Joe Biden has, it's easy to get caught in a lie or two. In Joe Biden's case, there are many. Here are five examples of Joe Biden making a complete hypocrite of himself:   Fast forward to 2023, Biden's multi-trillion-dollar budget as President contributed to the whopping deficit of $1.1 TRILLION DOLLARS. That number is just from the first SIX MONTHS of the 2023 fiscal year alone, not to mention his multi-trillion-dollar budget from 2022.  What happened to Zero Deficit Joe? If you want to learn more about Biden??s deficit you can watch  this clip  from the Glenn Beck Program. However, on April 9, 2021, Biden signed an executive order forming the ??Presidential Commission on the Supreme Court of the United States"" examine the membership and size of the Court. Who's the one with boneheaded ideas, now?  This remark is nearly the opposite to a comment Biden gave in a 1974 interview with the Washingtonian where he shared his opinion on the recently settled Roe v Wade case, harshly stating:  This was not the same tune Biden sang as he led the controversial hearings surrounding the nomination of Justice Clarence Thomas, an affair Thomas resentfully called a high-tech lynching.  To see Biden's comments about Justice Jackson, click here.  Only a few years prior, Biden spoke at the memorial service of Senator Byrd, where he said, I never called Senator Byrd Senator, I always called him, Leader. Robert Byrd was a decorated Senator, held many leadership positions within the Senate and, oh yeah, was responsible for the rebirth of the KKK in West Virginia.     WRITER  Texas is under threat of a George Soros-backed takeover. Soros-funded RINO judges have been elected in some of the highest courts in Texas. These judges implemented restr""ctions that have blocked nearly a thousand cases of voter fraud from being investigated or prosecuted from across the state. These new restrictions are similar to ones in place in states like George, Arizona, and Wisconsin, leaving Texas more susceptible to election corruption than ever. If Texas falls to corruption, America will lose its largest bastion of conservative electoral power in the nation. Without Texas, Republicans WILL NOT be able to win national elections and liberal corruption will go unchecked across the country.  Fortunately, there is a way to stop this: YOU. If you live in Texas you have a chance to stand up against corruption and to fight back! Starting Tuesday, February 20th, early voting for the primaries begins, where three of these judges are up for election. Go out and vote. If the right people are voted in, there's a good chance the restrictions will be lifted and election fraud can once again be prosecuted.  But remember, you can't just go in and vote for anyone who has an ""R"" next to their name. Sorors knows that a registered Democrat would never stand a chance in Texas, so his lackeys register as Republicans and ride the little ""R"" right into office. So who do you vote for?  Fortunately, Glenn had Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on his show today and Ken gave us his list of judges that he vouches for. His list is as follows:    WRITER  Who is really banning books? For years now, Conservatives have been taking flak from the left for supposed ""book bans."" The left likes to compare these ""bans"" to Nazi book burnings, accusing the right of sweeping authoritarian decrees designed to suppress information. In reality, this is a movement largely motivated by parents, who want to remove inappropriate books from children's libraries.  But if you want to discuss authoritarian book bans, look no further than the White House. As Glenn recently covered, the Biden administration has been pressuring the world's largest bookseller, Amazon, into suppressing books they disagree with. On February 5th, 2024, Ohio Representative Jim Jordan released a slew of subpoenaed documents that exposed pressure placed on Amazon by the Biden Administration. The documents, which Jordan dubbed ""The Amazon Files"" after Elon Musk's ""The Twitter Files,"" revealed an email conversation between Andrew Slavitt, a former White House senior adviser, and Amazon employees. In these emails, Slavitt complained that the top search results for books on ""vaccines"" were ""concerning"" and then requested that Amazon intervene. Amazon initially refused, not out of some altruistic concern for the free exchange of information. They thought any action taken would be ""too visible"" and would further exasperate the ??Harry/Sally narrative,?? referring to the outrage that followed Amazon's removal of Ryan T. Anderson??s book When Harry Became Sally.  Despite this initial refusal, Amazon agreed to meet with the White House a few days later. The number one item on their agenda was""oving books from the website. An Amazon employee even admitted that the reason they even took this meeting was due to the pressure being placed on them by the Biden Administration.  What was the result of this meeting? Amazon caved. They began to implement ways of limiting the outreach of books that challenged the mainstream vaccine narrative and other books the White House might not like. The White House was caught red-handed pressuring the world's largest bookseller to restrict the sale of books they consider in opposition to their narrative, and they have the gall to accuse conservatives of information suppression. This is just ONE of many actions committed by the Biden Administration that are more characteristic of a dictator than a president. What can you do about it? Fortunately, you are not dependent on Amazon and its corrupted algorithm to help you find books. Every week right here on GlennBeck.com, we highlight books that Glenn is reading or talking about in our ""Glenn's Bookshelf"" series. Here you can find a wide selection of books free from Amazon's filters. Be sure to sign up for Glenn's newsletter to find out about new additions to ""Glenn's Bookshelf"" every week.    WRITER   The left-wing media's most recent tirade is accusing Trump of being a dictator. But, as Glenn said, ""Everything they're accusing us of, they're doing."" Since day one, the Biden administration has overstepped the bounds placed on the executive branch set by the Constitution. In Glenn's most recent TV Special, he examined ten times Biden acted like a dictator, NOT a president. Here are 10 of Biden's Dictator Moves, and click HERE to get ALL of the research that went into this week's Glenn TV special:     WRITER   Every day it seems Glenn covers another story revealing how people across the world at all levels of power DESPISE the fact that YOU have rights, and they are actively trying to curtail them. Recently, there has been a string of attacks against the rights outlined in the First Amendment: the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, the freedom of assembly, and the freedom to petition. As a refresher, the First Amendment reads as follows: This is powerful stuff, there is a good reason the Founding Fathers made it the FIRST Amendment. It's also the reason why power-hungry elites are attacking it. These attacks are designed to control the way you think, speak, and believe, vote, what you read, and who holds your representatives responsible. The First Amendment is our strongest weapon against tyrants, and they know it. So what can you do about it? Hope that some wig in Washinton will eventually do something? We know how well that works. The best thing to do is to stay active, engage in the issues you care about, and exercise your rights.  So where to start? Here are a few things YOU can do to protect your First Amendment rights:                                Religion                                   The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is toyou guessed itpractice your faith. Become an active member in your place of worship, go to scripture studies, invite your friends to that late afternoon event, and walk the life. This can impact the way you spend money as well. Shop the businesses and brands that share your values, and don't shop at the ones that scorn them. Keeping the community alive and healthy is the best way to ensure that generations to come will be able to experience the freedom you enjoy.                              Speech                                   Much like religion, the best way to protect your freedom of speech is... to speak. Engage your friends and family in polite, civil conversation. Stand up for what you believe in, and make your case to your peers. Just remember to keep it friendly. No one ever won an argument by shouting down their opponent. The civil exchange of ideas is the cornerstone of our republic, and a dialogue where the participants are well-informed, considerate, compassionate, and open-minded can have permanent impacts on all involved.                              Press                                   Freedom of the Press seems a little tricky at first. Unless you work for the media, what are you supposed to do? Quit your job and go work for the local newspaper? The good news is that exercising this right is not nearly that difficult. In fact, you are currently doing it. The best thing you can do is to read from outlets that produce informative content. Want to know what Glenn consumes to stay informed every day?

Assembly                                    Anna Moneymaker / Staff | Getty ImagesFreedom of assembly is one of the more impactful yet underutilized freedoms in the First Amendment. Peaceably assembling and protesting with like-minded individuals can hugely influence politicians and policies while simultaneously creating community and fellowship between attendees. It's understandable why more people don't turn out. We're all busy people with busy schedules, and flying out to D.C. for the weekend seems like a daunting task to many. Thankfully, you don't have to go out all the way to D.C. to make a difference. Gather some like-minded people in your town and bring awareness to issues that impact your community. Big change starts locally, and exercising your freedom to assemble can be the catalyst to lasting impact.                               Petition                                   If you've been a long-time listener of Glenn, then you will have heard a few of his calls to action where he asks his audience to contact their representatives about a particular piece of policy. There is a good reason Glenn keeps on doing those: they work. Whether it's your local mayor or your senator, a call and an email go a long way. If you really want to make a change, convince your friends and family to reach out as well. The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is to??you guessed it??practice your faith.

BECKNews_19," During today's radio broadcast, Glenn shared a disturbing story: the Satanic Temple is filing lawsuits in GOP-led states with abortion bans fighting to preserve their ""Satanic abortion ritual"" as a religious right. And what's more??the mainstream media is heralding them as a force against the ""eligious right.""  The British publication The Guardian wrote a non-editorial piece on the Satanic Temple's fight against the conservative religious establishment. The article, written by Adam Gabbatt, featured an interview with Satanic Temple co-founder and spokesperson Lucien Greaves. Gabbatt praised the Satanic Temple's fight for ""fundamental issues,"" such as removing ""prayer in classrooms, religious holiday displays and the distribution of Bibles in schools,"" and now, abortion.  Satanic Temple founder Lucien Greaves attends the Sundance Film Festival.Tibrina Hobson / Stringer | Getty Images Gabbatt unabashedly depicted Greaves as an emblem of rationalism, freedom of speech, and freedom of choice. He highlighted the Satanic Temple's doctrine that Satan is a ""symbol of rebellion and opposition to authoritarianism. According to the Satanic Temple??s website, ??To embrace the name Satan is to embrace rational inquiry removed from supernaturalism and archaic tradition-based superstitions.?? Greaves himself tweeted that this very interview with The Guardian discussed his ""ht for democracy in an era of encroaching theocracy."" Have you heard a more perfect synopsis of the anti-religious left?   The Guardian''s left-leaning slant is anything but subtle. However, Gabbatt's bias in particular against Christian conservatives just oozes off of the article. He describes Greaves as a ""fitting frontman for a group that is regularly demonized by its Christian opponents""??pun intended???and says "" could be in one of the heavy metal bands that terrified neurotic parents in the 1980s and 90s."" According to Gabbatt, Greaves is an innocuous punk-rocker who is standing up to the ""draconian"" ""religious right."" This couldn't be further from the truth.  Reader discretion is advised. The following describes the details of the Satanic abortion ritual.  Let's get back to the original point at hand??what is the Satanic abortion ritual that Greaves is fighting for? It is disturbingly reminiscent of the platitudes we hear from the anti-religious left.  The Satanic Temple has seven fundamental tenants, and Greaves argues that the Satanic abortion ritual is an essential expression of the third and fifth tenants of the Temple and should therefore be protected by the First Amendment. As Greaves says: The Satanic Temple's pamphlet on the ""bortion ritual"" describes the procedure as the following: The Temple further affirms abortion as ""consistent with the ideals of liberty and freedom. Be proud of pursuing what you want for your life despite opposition.""  The Satanic abortion ritual To begin the ritual, the woman looks at herself in a mirror right before the abortion procedure, reminding herself of her ""personhood and [her] responsibility to [her]rself."" She then recites the third tenant of the Satanic Temple, which states: ""One??s body is inviolable, subject to one??s own will alone.""When she is ready for the abortion procedure, the woman recites the fifth tenant, which says, ""Beliefs should conform to one's best scientific understanding of the world. One should take care never to distort scientific facts to fit one's beliefs.""  Once the abortion is complete, the woman recites the ""personal affirmation,"" which is, ""By my body, my blood. By my will, it is done."" The Temple says the abortion ritual helps one ""feel doubts dissipating and your confidence growing as you have just undertaken a decision that affirms your autonomy and free will.""  This is evil... There is more to be said about the issues with Greave's religious liberty argument over the Satanic abortion ritual, but the root of the matter is simple: this is the battle between good and evil, and it is important we call it as such. Glenn continues to point out how the destructive denigration of the human person has its roots in the fact that we've disregarded the true God and replaced Him with ourselves. Notice how the Satanic language uses language like ""my blood,"" ""my choice,"" ""my body,"" ""my will."" These things derive their significance from God alone because personhood comes from the inherent dignity that He bestowed upon us. However, when we do away with God, these things become idols unto themselves, and the sanctity of personhood is sacrificed on the altar of the individual will.

BECKNews_20," Leftists around the globe have been pushing us closer and closer to chaos, seemingly in line with the CIA's 5 steps to revolution. Glenn reviews the steps and asks, which one are we on? But while governments around the world seem to be spiraling toward authoritarianism, Glenn explains why he's shocked to see the election of anarcho-capitalist Javier Milei in Argentina. While he looks and sounds unhinged, he's promising to SHRINK the government, not expand it. ""That's what makes him less scary,"" Glenn says. So, are people starting to take a stand against big government and the 5 steps to revolution?    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: These are the five steps, for revolution. It's -- you know, he accurately said in the clip I played for you a minute ago. The CIA developed this.And it was four revolutions. Green and Colour Revolutions. And it's really easy. You have to discredit the press. Now, once you advertise credit the press, you also have to discredit intelligentsia. You have to -- you have to discredit all the experts. Well, they've done both of these, themselves.Okay? And I don't think that it is a coincidence. That it works out. Everything that the left does, doesn't it always seem to be a win-win for them?Whether it works. Whether it doesn't. They always seems to win. It always works in their favor.So they've discredited the press.They've discredited the experts.How easy would it be to regain the trust of our doctors and our -- our scientists, if they would just come out and say, yeah. We really blew it here.And we're finding the people responsible for it.We know it was Fauci.Why wouldn't you do that?Because they want experts to continue to be discredited.By the average.So that way, when there's chaos on the street, do you trust the police?Do you trust the FBI?Do you trust the medical association?Do you trust the media?Who is coming for you? If there's real trouble, who is coming. Did you see the video of the guy in the streets of New York? He was a regular guy, standing up in the streets of New York. The press was asking him questions about, you know, why are you standing up against the letting people across the border.And he looked at the person. The reporter.And then he looked at the crowd, and he said, guys, it's up to us.No one is coming to save our city.No one is coming to save our state or our Constitution. No one is coming. The news is not telling you the truth. The politicians are part of it. The politicians are the ones doing it to us!We have to stand up. So that way, if everything is discredited, you feel like, you have to stand up. And then things get even more out of control, because somebody does something stupid. Or something is set up to make it look like, that other side is doing something.And they can crack down. Everybody cries out for order.Look at what's happening. In the news today, I was reading a couple of stories.Chicago area high school provides segregated classes for black and Hispanic students. Now, any time, in modern history, we would know that's racist.You can't do that.What are you doing?What is it doing?It is creating hostilities between races. It's creating separate classes.Except, it's just reversed.What is that going to do? Did you see there was another story -- where was this one? Maybe New York. Where the students, black and Hispanics, are no longer going to be held to that white standard of education. Now, what does that mean? You're going to lower the standards? Really? That's a white thing. Because I know a lot of dummy white people. What does that do? That just makes you into a slave. If you have poor education. And you're not held to a higher standard, what do you think is going to happen to our society? More than 2500 police officers in New York City, have quit this year. New York City is also a place where -- what was it? 2 billion -- I can't find it now. But the amount of money. I think it's $2.4 billion. That has been lost this year, in theft! In theft!Businesses are closing. They can't handle the amount of theft. What does that make you do? Makes you cry out for somebody to make it stop. Now, this is the way they're trying to make Argentinians. The Argentinian president, look. Like he's crazy and a fascist. But I want you to look at what he says. I don't necessarily like the way he says it. He uses the S-word a lot. But listen to what he's saying about the left in Argentina.VOICE: You can't give leftists an engine.VOICE: Can you define leftist?VOICE: All collectivists. All kinds of collectivists.VOICE: But why do you call them sheep?VOICE: Because they are. If you think differently from them, they will kill you.This is the point. You can't give sheep an engine. If you give them an inch, they will use it to destroy you.You can't negotiate with left hearts. You don't negotiate. You don't negotiate with trash because they will end you.They, the left, have a guy that beats his wife off.If it's one of them, he puts on the green scarf, and yells at neoliberalism all the time. And they hide it. Suddenly there's a journalist that molests another journalist.They hide it. When it's one of them, they hide it. They hide all of those apparitions.Now, if you are on the other side, they will ruin you. They will kill you. They will throw you everything. They don't care if they ruin your whole life. Why?Only because you don't think like that. And do you know what is the good part in all of this? Because since to err is human, since everyone can be mistaken, they force us to be better. And since we are getting better than them. Since we are crushing them in the cultural battle, we are not only superior economically, we are morally superior. We are better aesthetically superior. We are better than them at everything. And that triggers them. And since they can't beat us with real arguments, they just use the repressive apparatus of the state. With loads of taxpayer money to destroy us. And yet, they're still losing. They had to remove the blacklist. They had to remove the blacklist. You understand, they're losing. They're desperate. Leftists are losing the cultural battle. For the first time ever, they are cornered. Those leftists.GLENN: Now, when you watch him, he looks a little nuts.STU: He has an interesting aesthetic going on there.He has the crazy hair. Very passionate.But that's a way. You know, people use that to dismiss him. Obviously, at their own peril.GLENN: Correct. But listen to what they're saying. Why do we think this is about the Democrats and the Republicans?Why are we fighting over stupid parties? When this is being fought now in Ireland. When it's being fought in several countries in Europe. This is being fought. He was just elected as president of Argentina. This isn't an American problem. This isn't about Trump supporters. This isn't about the Tea Partiers.They want you to believe that it is. But it's not. It's about standing up against an ideology, of collectivism.That's what this is about. They believe that there are ranchers, and sheep. And if you agree with them, maybe you could be a rancher.Otherwise, get into the pen. You're sheep.And you will be slaughtered, if the sheep ever figure out. Wait a minute. There's more of us than them. You will be slaughtered.That's what we're arguing about.We're not arguing about tax policy or anything else.You know, this guy is a great example. You hear this from somebody on the right in Europe. It can be very scary. Because you don't know. Because in Europe, left and right is very different. The left is communism. The right is fascism.Both of those are oppressive. And death prescriptions. Horrible, horrible systems.Here, the left is totalitarianism, of any kind. Theological. Leftist. Fascistic. Any of this stuff. Communism.That's all on the left. In America, the right is anarchy.The government is so small, that it can't do anything. And the very extreme of that, is anarchy.We're just inside, out of reach of anarchy. That's what American conservatives should be fighting for. That's what makes this guy less scary.Now, he can change. Maybe he's a fraud.I don't know.But what he's saying, he's going to do is dismantle all of the power centers.He's going to dismantle their Federal Reserve. Their central bank.He says, they're controlling the finances. They're controlling the money. They're controlling everything. And they're debasing and devaluing the money of the average person.Well, same here! But if you speak out against the Federal Reserve. You're a crackpot.I'm a fascist, because I believe that no secret cabal of bankers and banks, should decide what my money is worth?That should decide what they can print and not print?That my children have to pay for?I'm a fascist because I believe that that shouldn't exist?This is -- he's right.They are losing it is going to come right down to the wire.And I think AI is going to play a big role.But if we stay sane, keep our wits and our heads, and our Judeo Christian ethics about us. And we let people see our ethics.Nobody wants to hang out with people who are screaming, you know, death to the Jews.At least, I hope not. And that's what they're becoming.Shout your abortion.Death to the Jews.Take and mutilate children.Teach children in school, that they should be protesters, above everything else. And that they can be whatever they want, and it starts with not listening to your parents. Because you know better than your parents. And we're on your side. Who wants that?That's what this is really all about. And I hope he does exactly what he says, he's going to do.   The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy people on the left. The AOC's have taken over, places in the media.And places like this in New York.This is what it is thousand. So there's been one case. One. One in the entire seven years. Where they did this.Where they shut down a company, that had no obvious victims.The case was 1972.And it was a company, relatively small company, that was writing term papers, for college students. Okay.So I want to write my paper.GLENN: I want to break out in God bless America.STU: Capitalism is pretty impressive. Apparently, this didn't go over that well.What they said, there were no obvious victims here. The people bought the term papers. They didn't want to write them. They got the term papers. They said, they were defrauding the education system.GLENN: Which they were.STU: This is the one time. And it's a small tiny company. Let me give you the other times they've done this.Tell me if any of these sound like, hey, I have a good interest rate, on a loan I paid back.Number one, a breast cancer nonprofit was shut down a dozen years ago. For using nearly all its $9 million in donations to pay for director's salaries, perks, and other expenses, instead of funding free mammograms. Okay.So they told everyone, donate money for free. Mammograms. And they just took all the money for themselves.That's number one. Number two, a private equity timber.Faking big investment success, was closed down after stealing millions of dollars from thousands of investors.Okay?You can see.GLENN: Yeah. Got it. But on both of those so far, you have hundreds of thousands of people, you know, I'm sure. That gave -- they're all victims.They gave their money.STU: Yeah. And they didn't get the thing that they want.GLENN: They didn't get the thing they were promised. You have all these people going to the AG. Saying, hey, this is a real problem here. This has to stop. Not here.GLENN: Not here.STU: Another one. Mental health facility, shuttered for looting $4 million from public funds, while neglecting patients.GLENN: Okay. Kind of a big one.STU: Pretty clear. An auto lender that allegedly charged hidden interest rates, got to stay in business last year if it paid a fine and didn't commit fraud in the future.So here's one they didn't shut down.They actually let them go on.They're going after Trump in all of this. In this one, they're like, oh. Sure, they're hidden fees.They're not telling you about them.GLENN: Okay.STU: A judge requested.A judge refused to request to shut down a river rafting company in 2011.After a customer drowned, and the attorney general showed it was repeatedly using unlicensed guides, or none at all.Instead, he ordered only a 50,000-dollar bond and cleanup -- for him to clean up his act.The company is still being run today, under a different name by the same family. Someone died.GLENN: We have thousands of victims.And in this case, somebody who is dead.STU: Is dead!GLENN: Dead!STU: They're like, you guys can stay open -- and then this one is my favorite one. A judge in 2001.Declined to appoint a receiver, to take over a porn site, despite millions of dollars of illegal credit card charges to hundreds of customers.Who thought they were getting a free tour.Now, look, you're -- you want to get the free -- you want to know what you're subscribing for, Glenn. Before you just pulled the trigger on that. So you put your credit card information into a porn site, I think some of these victims need some life changes to be made here.But they put their credit card into a porn site. Expecting a free tour.They instead, get charged and charged and charged and charged.I",-1,,0

BECKNews_22," For some unimaginable reason, National Public Radio (NPR) thought it would be a good idea to broadcast an absolutely horrific audio recording of a woman getting an abortion ?? just a few days before a major election. Instead of scoring points for the pro-choice Democratic Party, NPR may have accidentally aired nationwide one of the strongest pro-life advertisements ever made. ""PR aired an abortion. I think they thought this was going to help people go, 'Oh, is that it? It's safe and effective,'"" Glenn Beck said on the radio program. ""I'm not sure it's going to have the desired result."" Instead of making the reality of abortion less disturbing, NPR's recording of a woman in her 11th week of pregnancy crying and moaning while a vacuum machine whirs is more likely to haunt the dreams of pro-choicers everywhere. NPR reporter Kate Wells attempted to gloss over the horrors with soft narration about the ""soothing music"" and ""women guiding other women,?? before the suction sound shuts off and exclamations of ??You did good, you did great""y the staff can be heard. ""They think airing that abortion on NPR a few days before an election will be helpful ?? that's how far we have fallen,""Glenn commented.  Glenn, Pat Gray, and Stu Burgiere went on to discuss NPR's shocking broadcast and how only a few years ago, just the thought of airing an abortion was reprehensible.

WRITER  Texas is under threat of a George Soros-backed takeover. Soros-funded RINO judges have been elected in some of the highest courts in Texas. These judges implemented restrictions that have blocked nearly a thousand cases of voter fraud from being investigated or prosecuted from across the state. These new restrictions are similar to ones in place in states like George, Arizona, and Wisconsin, leaving Texas more susceptible to election corruption than ever. If Texas fa"" to corruption, America will lose its largest bastion of conservative electoral power in the nation. Without Texas, Republicans WILL NOT be able to win national elections and liberal corruption will go unchecked across the country.  Fortunately, there is a way to stop this: YOU. If you live in Texas you have a chance to stand up against corruption and to fight back! Starting Tuesday, February 20th, early voting for the primaries begins, where three of these judges are up for election. Go out and vote. If the right people are voted in, there's a good chance the restrictions will be lifted and election fraud can once again be prosecuted.  But remember, you can't just go in and vote for anyone who has an ""R"" next to their name. Sorors knows that a registered Democrat would never stand a chance in Texas, so his lackeys register as Republicans and ride the little ""R"" right into office. So who do you vote for?  Fortunately, Glenn had Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on his show today and Ken gave us his list of judges that he vouches for. His list is as follows:    WRITER  Who is really banning books? For years now, Conservatives have been taking flak from the left for supposed ""book bans."" The left likes to compare these ""bans"" to Nazi book burnings, accusing the right of sweeping authoritarian decrees designed to suppress information. In reality, this is a movement largely motivated by parents, who want to remove inappropriate books from children's libraries.  But if you want to discuss authoritarian book bans, look no further than the White House. As Glenn recently covered, the Biden administration has been pressuring the world's largest bookseller, Amazon, into suppressing books they disagree with. On February 5th, 2024, Ohio Representative Jim Jordan released a slew of subpoenaed documents that exposed pressure placed on Amazon by the Biden Administration. The documents, which Jordan dubbed ""The Amazon Files"" after Elon Musk's ""The Twitter Files,"" revealed an email conversation between Andrew Slavitt, a former White House senior adviser, and Amazon employees. In these emails, Slavitt complained that the top search results for books on ""vaccines"" were ""concerning"" and then requested that Amazon intervene. Amazon initially refused, not out of some altruistic concern for the free exchange of information. They thought any action taken would be ""too visible"" and would further exasperate the ??Harry/Sally narrative,?? referring to the outrage that followed Amazon's removal of Ryan T. Anderson??s book When Harry Became Sally.  Despite this initial refusal, Amazon agreed to meet with the White House a few days later. The number one item on their agenda was""oving books from the website. An Amazon employee even admitted that the reason they even took this meeting was due to the pressure being placed on them by the Biden Administration.  What was the result of this meeting? Amazon caved. They began to implement ways of limiting the outreach of books that challenged the mainstream vaccine narrative and other books the White House might not like. The White House was caught red-handed pressuring the world's largest bookseller to restrict the sale of books they consider in opposition to their narrative, and they have the gall to accuse conservatives of information suppression. This is just ONE of many actions committed by the Biden Administration that are more characteristic of a dictator than a president. What can you do about it? Fortunately, you are not dependent on Amazon and its corrupted algorithm to help you find books. Every week right here on GlennBeck.com, we highlight books that Glenn is reading or talking about in our ""Glenn's Bookshelf"" series.

WRITER   The left-wing media's most recent tirade is accusing Trump of being a dictator. But, as Glenn said, ""Everything they're accusing us of, they're doing."" Since day one, the Biden administration has overstepped the bounds placed on the executive branch set by the Constitution. In Glenn's most recent TV Special, he examined ten times Biden acted like a dictator, NOT a president. Here are 10 of Biden's Dictator Moves, and click HERE to get ALL of the research that went into this week's Glenn TV special:     WRITER   Every day it seems Glenn covers another story revealing how people across the world at all levels of power DESPISE the fact that YOU have rights, and they are actively trying to curtail them. Recently, there has been a string of attacks against the rights outlined in the First Amendment: the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, the freedom of assembly, and the freedom to petition. As a refresher, the First Amendment reads as follows: This is powerful stuff, there is a good reason the Founding Fathers made it the FIRST Amendment. It's also the reason why power-hungry elites are attacking it. These attacks are designed to control the way you think, speak, and believe, vote, what you read, and who holds your representatives responsible. The First Amendment is our strongest weapon against tyrants, and they know it. So what can you do about it? Hope that some wig in Washinton will eventually do something? We know how well that works. The best thing to do is to stay active, engage in the issues you care about, and exercise your rights.  So where to start? Here are a few things YOU can do to protect your First Amendment rights:                                Religion                                   The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is toyou guessed itpractice your faith. Become an active member in your place of worship, go to scripture studies, invite your friends to that late afternoon event, and walk the life. This can impact the way you spend money as well. Shop the businesses and brands that share your values, and don't shop at the ones that scorn them. Keeping the community alive and healthy is the best way to ensure that generations to come will be able to experience the freedom you enjoy.                              Speech                                   Much like religion, the best way to protect your freedom of speech is... to speak. Engage your friends and family in polite, civil conversation. Stand up for what you believe in, and make your case to your peers. Just remember to keep it friendly. No one ever won an argument by shouting down their opponent. The civil exchange of ideas is the cornerstone of our republic, and a dialogue where the participants are well-informed, considerate, compassionate, and open-minded can have permanent impacts on all involved.                              Press                                   Freedom of the Press seems a little tricky at first. Unless you work for the media, what are you supposed to do? Quit your job and go work for the local newspaper? The good news is that exercising this right is not nearly that difficult. In fact, you are currently doing it. The best thing you can do is to read from outlets that produce informative content. Want to know what Glenn consumes to stay informed every day?

Assembly                                    Anna Moneymaker / Staff | Getty ImagesFreedom of assembly is one of the more impactful yet underutilized freedoms in the First Amendment. Peaceably assembling and protesting with like-minded individuals can hugely influence politicians and policies while simultaneously creating community and fellowship between attendees. It's understandable why more people don't turn out. We're all busy people with busy schedules, and flying out to D.C. for the weekend seems like a daunting task to many. Thankfully, you don't have to go out all the way to D.C. to make a difference. Gather some like-minded people in your town and bring awareness to issues that impact your community. Big change starts locally, and exercising your freedom to assemble can be the catalyst to lasting impact.                               Petition                                   If you've been a long-time listener of Glenn, then you will have heard a few of his calls to action where he asks his audience to contact their representatives about a particular piece of policy. There is a good reason Glenn keeps on doing those: they work. Whether it's your local mayor or your senator, a call and an email go a long way. If you really want to make a change, convince your friends and family to reach out as well. The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is to??you guessed it??practice your faith. Become an active member in your place of worship, go to scripture studies, invite your friends to that late afternoon event, and walk the life. This can impact the way you spend money as well.

BECKNews_23," MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace recently claimed that former president Donald Trump has an ""affinity FOR Hitler."" But how many times in the past month has this same mainstream media spewed Hamas talking points in the name of exposing Israeli ""oppression?"" Glenn argues that maybe instead of trying to paint Trump as Hitler 2.0, the media should speak out against the real fascist movements of our time, including Great Britain's embrace of the arguments of eugenics and global progressives' love for public-private partnerships. (Newsflash: Hitler loved these too!)    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Who was it on CNBC. I think it was NBC.That was talking about, you know, how Donald Trump just loves Hitler.STU: Oh, this is their new thing.They're doing it like crazy. They just keep saying. Oh, Trump.The clip I think I saw which was probably the same one. Was I think Nicole Wallace. Who was supposedly a former Republican.Saying, look, you know, Trump's typical love of Hitler is expressed out of -- that he's just so stupid, he loves Hitler.But in reality, it's much worse than that.And it's like, wait. What previous love of Hitler?Did I miss a news story or two?I don't know exactly what that was.GLENN: His love for Hitler.STU: It's an interesting thing. Jared Kushner should be alerted, immediately.GLENN: I know. And the Jewish state.Wow. He made an amazing deal, for Israel. Moved the -- moved the embassy to Jerusalem. Wow, he's a really bad Hitler.STU: Legitimately, you can argue, it's his greatest accomplishment as president.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: What he did in the Middle East.GLENN: You could argue, was his greatest accomplishment.GLENN: So we welcome Pat Gray from Pat Gray Unleashed. Pat, with an exception of I want to put Jews in crematorium, which I could argue they're on that path.You know, siding with Iran. And siding with the Palestinians.Who are saying, burn the Jews. Send them to Germany.Hitler was right. All of these things.STU: If you're in -- if there's a giant crowd of protesters. Pro Palestinian protesters.How many steps do you have to take, until you bump into someone, who would say, gas the Jews?Four? How many steps?Is it three? Too many.PAT: It's too many.STU: It's not a lot.It's not 80. I will tell you that.GLENN: No. It's not.PAT: No.GLENN: So you have that. Where they're flirting with it.And they keep making this deal. That they hate Hitler.Which I personally do.I hate him for.STU: Not a fan.GLENN: Yeah. Multiple reasons.But I don't think they do.Look at what's happening.PAT: My gosh, they just found copies of Mein Kampf, on -- in terrorist headquarters in Hamas.GLENN: Yeah, and it was -- and they were highlighting all the things about the Jews.PAT: Yeah. Yeah.GLENN: What are they doing in Britain? What did they do yesterday?PAT: Britain's high court, essentially gave a death sentence to an eight-month baby girl.This baby girl had a -- some rare disease, and they couldn't -- they weren't going to treat her anymore. In Britain.They were like, okay. Let us take her somewhere else.GLENN: They had the money. Everything.PAT: Yeah. Italy said, we'll pay for it. We'll bring your baby here. We will -- we have a new treatment, that is working pretty well. Shows some promise.And this will give you more time with your baby. It's on us.Come here. And we'll treat her. Britain's high court said, no. No.GLENN: Not --PAT: Not only that. But I'm just -- because we're turning off all of the lifesaving machinery that's on her. She was on life support. They turned it off. And sent her not home, but to some nursing facility.And so instead of allowing her to die with the family, the family had to go to this nursing facility, and the baby did die right away. Rather than allow her to go to Italy, who was completely willing to cover all of it.GLENN: So what happened to the Jews?With Germany, happened after the progressives. The eugenics people. All killed. Babies, and children.And old people.And the infirmed. Just like what's happening in Great Britain, and in Canada.PAT: It was the -- it was the kind thing to do, to allow them to die with dignity.Really? Is that what you're doing?GLENN: And that's what they're saying. I don't understand how half the country.PAT: How about you let the parents decide?GLENN: You know, you keep saying that your -- you know, you are against Hitler. Okay. So how about not public/private partnerships. Because that's what Hitler did. STU: Go back and read liberal fascism. Right? Where you will see, the point of that book basically was, outside of the killing all the Jews things, there's a lot of similarities here, between the modern left and the fascists of that day. But when you look at what's happening with Israel right now and the protests. And the people in Congress. Who sound an awful lot like the rhetoric of those days from Germany.Because they are literally echoing the -- they're at the very least propping up and supporting the people who do believe that Hitler did the right thing.Right?At the very least, they're supporting them. They're repeating their propaganda. They're acting as if they're neutral parties in this.And reliable narrators of this whole thing.And, well, you keep saying, I can't believe Trump, he's just like Hitler.Well, what -- why is that even an insult from you? You seem to like almost all of his policies. Where is the line?What is the thing that they want to happen. Because I always want to come back to. I always kill the Jews. I don't know.Recently, I'm questioning that assumption.PAT: Listen to the rhetoric. The rhetoric coming from the left. They do have a deep-seated hatred for Jews. They just do.GLENN: They do. They do.PAT: It's scary. It's really frightening. From a time, 75 years ago, when we said, never again.To a time now, already. Where it's kind of fomenting right now.GLENN: And all of the same.This is what I said, in 2008. All of the old hatreds that we saw in the 1930s, will come roaring back.STU: Yeah. You've said that a million times.What's so strange about it. I don't know. I get so fooled about this assumption. That we pass these things.Racism was that thing for a while ago. Anti-Semitism was that thing for a while ago.Thank God we passed that era.Eugenics was a long time ago. It was a hundred years ago. Look, it's important to understand it. But it's not here today. Let's make sure we avoid it. But like, these things keep coming back.Like the old hatreds keep returning over and over again. I don't --GLENN: It's like the Gods of the copybook headings.STU: 100 percent.And it's like I don't understand it.I don't understand how you can let a baby die, when you have a chance.PAT: I don't either. I don't either.STU: And their parents want them to live.It's free!PAT: Yeah.STU: Every little bump you could come up with. Every argument to say, well, sorry, we have to kill the kid, because it will cost us $12. All right. The $12 is paid for. Now, what? And still the baby dies. Why?PAT: Yeah.GLENN: It's a culture of death. That's the only thing I can come up -- it's evil. And it's a culture of death. And I can't -- I mean, because of what's happening in the Middle East.I keep coming back. What was God's commandment to his chosen people?As they're getting into the Promised Land. What does he say to them?PAT: Live long and prosper. Wait. Maybe that's -- am I messing up --GLENN: Yeah.PAT: Yeah. GLENN: He said, choose life. Choose life.And that makes so much sense.In a way that it's never made sense to me before.You know, of course, we choose life.I've always -- of course we choose life. Yeah, we choose life. We're America, we choose life. Okay. The abortion thing.But look at, every single thing, that is being pushed is death.PAT: Yep.GLENN: It is all death.PAT: It's a death cult. The left is a death cult.GLENN: All the way down to the -- the -- going in and mutilating our children.That is -- that ends in that line, dying.Because you cannot have children.So it's dead. That line is dead.STU: Not to mention, they call it dead naming.When you change, you're basically killing off the person that you were. For this new person. I was going to say, new and improved.But I was going to say, it wasn't an improvement.But the new and improved version of you. You're not allowed to mention Bruce Jenner anymore.It really is -- you get down these roads. And it's like, where?Where? What's the other explanation? Other than, just these people are bad people who like bad things?GLENN: They are. They are. STU: I don't know.GLENN: To quote Hillary Clinton, they are early 20th century progressives. This -- they did all of these same things.PAT: That's never been as true as it is now.GLENN: They did all these same things. They were sterilizing people. They were silencing people. They were putting you in jail, for your political opinion.All of that stuff, is that an early 20th century, American progressive. And that's who they are.Period. That's who they are.    The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy people on the left. The AOC's have taken over, places in the media.And places like this in New York.This is what it is thousand. So there's been one case. One. One in the entire seven years. Where they did this.Where they shut down a company, that had no obvious victims.The case was 1972.And it was a company, relatively small company, that was writing term papers, for college students. Okay.So I want to write my paper.GLENN: I want to break out in God bless America.STU: Capitalism is pretty impressive. Apparently, this didn't go over that well.What they said, there were no obvious victims here. The people bought the term papers. They didn't want to write them. They got the term papers. They said, they were defrauding the education system.GLENN: Which they were.STU: This is the one time. And it's a small tiny company. Let me give you the other times they've done this.Tell me if any of these sound like, hey, I have a good interest rate, on a loan I paid back.Number one, a breast cancer nonprofit was shut down a dozen years ago. For using nearly all its $9 million in donations to pay for director's salaries, perks, and other expenses, instead of funding free mammograms. Okay.So they told everyone, donate money for free. Mammograms. And they just took all the money for themselves.That's number one. Number two, a private equity timber.Faking big investment success, was closed down after stealing millions of dollars from thousands of investors.Okay?You can see.GLENN: Yeah. Got it. But on both of those so far, you have hundreds of thousands of people, you know, I'm sure. That gave -- they're all victims.They gave their money.STU: Yeah. And they didn't get the thing that they want.GLENN: They didn't get the thing they were promised. You have all these people going to the AG. Saying, hey, this is a real problem here. This has to stop. Not here.GLENN: Not here.STU: Another one. Mental health facility, shuttered for looting $4 million from public funds, while neglecting patients.GLENN: Okay. Kind of a big one.STU: Pretty clear. An auto lender that allegedly charged hidden interest rates, got to stay in business last year if it paid a fine and didn't commit fraud in the future.So here's one they didn't shut down.They actually let them go on.They're going after Trump in all of this. In this one, they're like, oh. Sure, they're hidden fees.They're not telling you about them.GLENN: Okay.STU: A judge requested.A judge refused to request to shut down a river rafting company in 2011.After a customer drowned, and the attorney general showed it was repeatedly using unlicensed guides, or none at all.Instead, he ordered only a 50,000-dollar bond and cleanup -- for him to clean up his act.The company is still being run today, under a different name by the same family. Someone died.GLENN: We have thousands of victims.And in this case, somebody who is dead.STU: Is dead!GLENN: Dead!STU: They're like, you guys can stay open -- and then this one is my favorite one. A judge in 2001.Declined to appoint a receiver, to take over a porn site, despite millions of dollars of illegal credit card charges to hundreds of customers.Who thought they were getting a free tour.Now, look, you're -- you want to get the free -- you want to know what you're subscribing for, Glenn. Before you just pulled the trigger on that. So you put your credit card information into a porn site, I think some of these victims need some life changes to be made here.But they put their credit card into a porn site. Expecting a free tour.They instead, get charged and charged and charged and charged.In fact, once the owners of the site were caught, they attempted to move their money overseas, to avoid any penalty.Still, the judge said, appointing a receiver was an extraordinary remedy!That should be used sparingly, and that a preliminary injunction",0,,-1
BECKNews_24," Most people don't know too much about the new Speaker of the House, Rep. Mike Johnson. He's gone mostly under the media's radar during his time in Congress. So, Glenn finds it odd that the corporate media immediately started attacking him. But that might be ""a pretty good sign,"" Glenn argues. ""Be cautious,"" he warns, but we might finally have a good speaker. And his first test, the next government spending bill, is right around the corner.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Oh, my gosh, the new speaker is here. You are excited?STU: Mike Johnson.GLENN: He's the one who we've been looking for. He's the one.Now, let me tell you a little bit about what I know about Mike Johnson. Okay. Now that we have that covered, let me tell you how I view this.The media loves Mike -- or hates Mike Johnson.STU: Today.GLENN: Hates him. Yeah. Hates him.STU: Passionately hate him.GLENN: Remember when McCarthy was Hitler.STU: Oh, yeah. He was the most right-wing Speaker in history.GLENN: Yeah, this is Hitler's Hitler. This is the one who Hitler looked up to. Oh, my gosh. That guy is bad.STU: I noticed that in the coverage. All of a sudden, Kevin McCarthy is a moderate guy. This guy, he's crazy.GLENN: Oh, he's nuts.Okay. So here's the thing.I'm just going to give you. I want you to do. I want you to view this in a different way.I remember being on the air, when the -- I don't remember, white or black smoke came out of -- of the Vatican. And we were like, got a new pope.And the media was like, oh, we're going to hate all these popes. All these popes, they're bad popes. This pope is going to be a really bad pope. They're so bigoted. And then Francis, they pulled out the name.I mean, immediately, within ten minutes. Everyone on CNN, MSNBC, was like, oh, he's a good pope. He's one of the best popes ever.He's going to be, wow.We love this guy. And I remember looking at Stu saying, uh-oh. There's something really wrong with this guy. Okay?STU: Uh-oh pap.GLENN: So what did we do?We didn't know. We had a pretty good indication, because the media loved him.Seeing that the media does not love Johnson, I think that's a pretty good sign.But just like this pope, I didn't want to say, uh-oh. More than, be cautious.So I'm going to say the same thing here. Be cautious.But maybe, we have a good pope. Or, I mean, a good speaker.Unlike, I said, be cautious. This guy could be a nightmare.Be cautious.This guy might be good.STU: Yeah. Look, it could be good.His voting record, isn't all that much better than McCarthy's. Pretty much the same.GLENN: But McCarthy was not that bad.STU: It seems like a catastrophe.The question was, is the risk worth it, for this type of outcome?As we said in the beginning, most likely, what will happen, is someone similar, like McHenry, or McCarthy or Scalise. Is the guy that will get through. And that's probably what will happen.He is conservative. Like, he's very good on issues like pro-life. He didn't have that problem with McCarthy really either.And, of course, they're not going to ban abortion. Well, they only have the House. Like, that won't happen.GLENN: Right. So here's the thing.We will know quite quickly, because we have the spending bill coming up.And what a surprise, it happens right before the holidays. Happens right before Thanksgiving. Huh.Nothing bad ever happens in Congress. When we all go away, for Thanksgiving and Christmas.STU: Right. We have our holiday parties. And they have their holiday parties. And their holiday parties are much better than ours. They spent trillions of dollars.GLENN: Right. So we'll see. With this first holiday party.If we --STU: He's already indicated, Glenn, by the way, he will support a spending deal to go forward.So this is not like a guy who will reverse the things like Matt Gaetz said, for example. He was opposed. He was upset about. This is a guy who he outwardly said, he wants to sign a short-term spending deal, to get us through these times, so the government doesn't shut down.So, again, I think you'll get similar -- that's not the worst thing in the world.GLENN: How long is the short-term thing? Like, if you give it to February. I'm not thrilled with this, by any stretch.Because something will come you up. And they will be like, you know what, we need a little more time.Short spending bills is not the answer. However, a -- a CR is really bad. And if he gives us another continuing resolution, where they don't -- they don't -- they don't even try to put spending, back where it belongs, there's trouble.STU: I mean, look, they're going to spend some sort.They will get some sort of spending package through. It might be short-term. It might be more of a continuing resolution.They're going to do it. The question is whether there will be any concessions. You may get a few concessions to conservatives.Of course, with those concessions, always come concessions to the left.So you might say, well, we will not spend this many dollars on this thing, that conservatives don't like. Maybe you cut some of the Ukraine spending out. Whatever the issue of the day is. Of course, at the same time, to get this stuff through, what usually happens is there's little gifts to the moderate side of the Republicans.And in this case, because you have to work with the Senate and the president on it, you wind up giving concessions to people on the left too.There's only so much of what a Speaker can do, which is part of the reason why the last few weeks didn't make all that much sense. Right? They can't do much.Hopefully at the very least, and it seems like he will be. He will be good on these investigations. He won't be Jim Jordan on them. But he at least can be someone who is aggressive, and hopefully allows the truth to come out, and that's the main thing that the House can do right now.   The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy people on the left. The AOC's have taken over, places in the media.And places like this in New York.This is what it is thousand. So there's been one case. One. One in the entire seven years. Where they did this.Where they shut down a company, that had no obvious victims.The case was 1972.And it was a company, relatively small company, that was writing term papers, for college students. Okay.So I want to write my paper.GLENN: I want to break out in God bless America.STU: Capitalism is pretty impressive. Apparently, this didn't go over that well.What they said, there were no obvious victims here. The people bought the term papers. They didn't want to write them. They got the term papers. They said, they were defrauding the education system.GLENN: Which they were.STU: This is the one time. And it's a small tiny company. Let me give you the other times they've done this.Tell me if any of these sound like, hey, I have a good interest rate, on a loan I paid back.Number one, a breast cancer nonprofit was shut down a dozen years ago. For using nearly all its $9 million in donations to pay for director's salaries, perks, and other expenses, instead of funding free mammograms. Okay.So they told everyone, donate money for free. Mammograms. And they just took all the money for themselves.That's number one. Number two, a private equity timber.Faking big investment success, was closed down after stealing millions of dollars from thousands of investors.Okay?You can see.GLENN: Yeah. Got it. But on both of those so far, you have hundreds of thousands of people, you know, I'm sure. That gave -- they're all victims.They gave their money.STU: Yeah. And they didn't get the thing that they want.GLENN: They didn't get the thing they were promised. You have all these people going to the AG. Saying, hey, this is a real problem here. This has to stop. Not here.GLENN: Not here.STU: Another one. Mental health facility, shuttered for looting $4 million from public funds, while neglecting patients.GLENN: Okay. Kind of a big one.STU: Pretty clear. An auto lender that allegedly charged hidden interest rates, got to stay in business last year if it paid a fine and didn't commit fraud in the future.So here's one they didn't shut down.They actually let them go on.They're going after Trump in all of this. In this one, they're like, oh. Sure, they're hidden fees.They're not telling you about them.GLENN: Okay.STU: A judge requested.A judge refused to request to shut down a river rafting company in 2011.After a customer drowned, and the attorney general showed it was repeatedly using unlicensed guides, or none at all.Instead, he ordered only a 50,000-dollar bond and cleanup -- for him to clean up his act.The company is still being run today, under a different name by the same family. Someone died.GLENN: We have thousands of victims.And in this case, somebody who is dead.STU: Is dead!GLENN: Dead!STU: They're like, you guys can stay open -- and then this one is my favorite one. A judge in 2001.Declined to appoint a receiver, to take over a porn site, despite millions of dollars of illegal credit card charges to hundreds of customers.Who thought they were getting a free tour.Now, look, you're -- you want to get the free -- you want to know what you're subscribing for, Glenn. Before you just pulled the trigger on that. So you put your credit card information into a porn site, I think some of these victims need some life changes to be made here.But they put their credit card into a porn site. Expecting a free tour.They instead, get charged and charged and charged and charged.In fact, once the owners of the site were caught, they attempted to move their money overseas, to avoid any penalty.Still, the judge said, appointing a receiver was an extraordinary remedy!That should be used sparingly, and that a preliminary injunction was good enough.Only after all that happened, it they find out, the people running the porn site, were the Gambino crime family.(laughter)I kid you not. The Gambino crime family.GLENN: And they didn't go into receivership.STU: So there you go. Think about that.I mean, it's so obvious, what they're doing. Latitia james talked about it when she ran.Her goal was to take this one individual out.And the New York -- the voters of New York, said, good.Go do it.And now she's doing it.GLENN: Okay. If you are -- if you have business in in New York, if you're in New York, I'm just telling you. You have to do what you have to do.There's no way, I would keep my business in New York.There is no rule of law now. You know it on the streets. But there is no rule of law. If they can get away with this. They can do anything to you.   Elon Musk has announced that the first Neuralink patient can now control a computer mouse by just thinking. But while this technology could help a lot of people, should we proceed with caution? Between AI and this new merger of man and machine, Glenn gives a warning about what the future could hold. Glenn and Stu also review the controversy surrounding Googles Gemini AI, which refused to generate images of white people.     Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: So the website, Down Detector, detected a surge in outage reports from users at AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Customer Cellular, Boost Mobile, US Cellular, and Straight Talk.That the reports of the system being downed or outages, began at 3:45 a.m. Eastern time. The outages have been reported across many major US cities.It looks like, that it is back up. I'm not sure.They say, they don't think this was a cyber attack.But how did all of them go down at the same time?I mean, that's kind of weird.Yesterday, Israel had a cyber attack.It was from Iran. The Israelis say. And it was an attack on their cell phone services.So quite a coincidence. But let's not jump to any conclusions. Let's see what actually happened.Cyber attacks are going to happen. At some point, soon. We will have cyber attacks. And it will leave you vulnerable, if that's what you depend on.We are becoming more and more, a society that is connected in all things, and absolutely incapable of doing any things, without our electronics.We hit a milestone yesterday. This is truly like landing a man on the moon, I think. This is -- this is the first real merging of man and machine, I think. I mean, we've had the electronic. You know, the bionic arms and things like that.But this is in your mind.It's Neuralink. Elon Musk came up with it. And it is really tempting, bec",-4,,-5

BECKNews_26," People often talk about how the Left has embraced politics as its new religion. But Minister Jonathan Cahn, who authored ""The Harbinger,"" takes it a step farther. His latest book, ""The Return of the Gods,"" shows how the radical transformations of society today are part of an ancient pattern. Most of us can sense the evil spreading. We can tell that our society is sick. One mistake we make is the idea that the people devoted to destroying us are unhinged. They are, in a certain sense, but there is nothing irrational about what theyre doing. Theres something supernatural happening, and Jonathan blames the evil gods Baal, Ishtar, and Moloch. Jesus put an end to these ancient evils. But now they are returning, and America is leading the way, driven by the exploitation of children, the destruction of marriage, and the ubiquity of pornography. Their hidden pagan symbolism has begun emerging into plain sight, from Pride parades to rainbows and humans becoming like the machines and the animals. Jonathans solution is simple. Following the guidance of Jesus, he says, Dont be timid with goodness, dont be timid with your love.     The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy people on the left. The AOC's have taken over, places in the media.And places like this in New York.This is what it is thousand. So there's been one case. One. One in the entire seven years. Where they did this.Where they shut down a company, that had no obvious victims.The case was 1972.And it was a company, relatively small company, that was writing term papers, for college students. Okay.So I want to write my paper.GLENN: I want to break out in God bless America.STU: Capitalism is pretty impressive. Apparently, this didn't go over that well.What they said, there were no obvious victims here. The people bought the term papers. They didn't want to write them. They got the term papers. They said, they were defrauding the education system.GLENN: Which they were.STU: This is the one time. And it's a small tiny company. Let me give you the other times they've done this.Tell me if any of these sound like, hey, I have a good interest rate, on a loan I paid back.Number one, a breast cancer nonprofit was shut down a dozen years ago. For using nearly all its $9 million in donations to pay for director's salaries, perks, and other expenses, instead of funding free mammograms. Okay.So they told everyone, donate money for free. Mammograms. And they just took all the money for themselves.That's number one. Number two, a private equity timber.Faking big investment success, was closed down after stealing millions of dollars from thousands of investors.Okay?You can see.GLENN: Yeah. Got it. But on both of those so far, you have hundreds of thousands of people, you know, I'm sure. That gave -- they're all victims.They gave their money.STU: Yeah. And they didn't get the thing that they want.GLENN: They didn't get the thing they were promised. You have all these people going to the AG. Saying, hey, this is a real problem here. This has to stop. Not here.GLENN: Not here.STU: Another one. Mental health facility, shuttered for looting $4 million from public funds, while neglecting patients.GLENN: Okay. Kind of a big one.STU: Pretty clear. An auto lender that allegedly charged hidden interest rates, got to stay in business last year if it paid a fine and didn't commit fraud in the future.So here's one they didn't shut down.They actually let them go on.They're going after Trump in all of this. In this one, they're like, oh. Sure, they're hidden fees.They're not telling you about them.GLENN: Okay.STU: A judge requested.A judge refused to request to shut down a river rafting company in 2011.After a customer drowned, and the attorney general showed it was repeatedly using unlicensed guides, or none at all.Instead, he ordered only a 50,000-dollar bond and cleanup -- for him to clean up his act.The company is still being run today, under a different name by the same family. Someone died.GLENN: We have thousands of victims.And in this case, somebody who is dead.STU: Is dead!GLENN: Dead!STU: They're like, you guys can stay open -- and then this one is my favorite one. A judge in 2001.Declined to appoint a receiver, to take over a porn site, despite millions of dollars of illegal credit card charges to hundreds of customers.Who thought they were getting a free tour.Now, look, you're -- you want to get the free -- you want to know what you're subscribing for, Glenn. Before you just pulled the trigger on that. So you put your credit card information into a porn site, I think some of these victims need some life changes to be made here.But they put their credit card into a porn site. Expecting a free tour.They instead, get charged and charged and charged and charged.In fact, once the owners of the site were caught, they attempted to move their money overseas, to avoid any penalty.Still, the judge said, appointing a receiver was an extraordinary remedy!That should be used sparingly, and that a preliminary injunction was good enough.Only after all that happened, it they find out, the people running the porn site, were the Gambino crime family.(laughter)I kid you not. The Gambino crime family.GLENN: And they didn't go into receivership.STU: So there you go. Think about that.I mean, it's so obvious, what they're doing. Latitia james talked about it when she ran.Her goal was to take this one individual out.And the New York -- the voters of New York, said, good.Go do it.And now she's doing it.GLENN: Okay. If you are -- if you have business in in New York, if you're in New York, I'm just telling you. You have to do what you have to do.There's no way, I would keep my business in New York.There is no rule of law now. You know it on the streets. But there is no rule of law. If they can get away with this. They can do anything to you.   Elon Musk has announced that the first Neuralink patient can now control a computer mouse by just thinking. But while this technology could help a lot of people, should we proceed with caution? Between AI and this new merger of man and machine, Glenn gives a warning about what the future could hold. Glenn and Stu also review the controversy surrounding Googles Gemini AI, which refused to generate images of white people.     Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: So the website, Down Detector, detected a surge in outage reports from users at AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Customer Cellular, Boost Mobile, US Cellular, and Straight Talk.That the reports of the system being downed or outages, began at 3:45 a.m. Eastern time. The outages have been reported across many major US cities.It looks like, that it is back up. I'm not sure.They say, they don't think this was a cyber attack.But how did all of them go down at the same time?I mean, that's kind of weird.Yesterday, Israel had a cyber attack.It was from Iran. The Israelis say. And it was an attack on their cell phone services.So quite a coincidence. But let's not jump to any conclusions. Let's see what actually happened.Cyber attacks are going to happen. At some point, soon. We will have cyber attacks. And it will leave you vulnerable, if that's what you depend on.We are becoming more and more, a society that is connected in all things, and absolutely incapable of doing any things, without our electronics.We hit a milestone yesterday. This is truly like landing a man on the moon, I think. This is -- this is the first real merging of man and machine, I think. I mean, we've had the electronic. You know, the bionic arms and things like that.But this is in your mind.It's Neuralink. Elon Musk came up with it. And it is really tempting, because this is -- you know, this will be great to some degree. You'll be able to access information, and have the old internet in your head. You want to speak French?Okay. Download it. Got it.I mean, it is really -- isn't that the Matrix?STU: Yeah. The Matrix too. We're turning into The Matrix. That's the theme of the show today. GLENN: So that is now the beginnings of that, happened and was announced yesterday. Elon Musk said, Neuralink is active in the first person, to have one of the chips implanted in their brain. They have seemingly made a full recovery.We -- you know, so far. We don't know what the effects of this are, or will be. But Musk said, the patient can now move the mouse around a screen, just by thinking.So he has Bluetoothed himself to the screen.Crazy. Huh.STU: It's incredible that they can do that. And, you know, also, look at the way Elon Musk does business.This is a lot of what he does. Which is a lot of kind of just -- let's try it. There's a lot of -- hey, let's give it a whirl.GLENN: He said I think yesterday or earlier this week, that he had plans by 2029, to have a million people on Mars.And when I heard that, I thought, there's no -- oh, it's Elon Musk. Maybe.STU: Well, yeah. And this is his goal, with all of this stuff. He has -- I think it's a T-shirt or something. He wears. Like occupy mars.This is the central idea of his life.GLENN: And this is part of it. Neuralink is part of it.He believes that we are on such a dystopian track right now. That because of global warming, but also because of AI.He believes AI is just as dangerous as global warming. He believes we cannot compete with AI.Unless we can merge with it. Okay.Because it will be operating at such high speeds. We don't have the processing capabilities for the speeds.You know, it's kind of like -- kind of like dogs. Dog life. Seven years. One year for us.It's like one year is a thousand years for AI.So it's moving at such a rapid speed, we won't be able to keep up. So he believes that we need to be able to merge with the machine, until we can get off, this planet.I don't think he'll be taking Neuralink with him. Or maybe he just thinks we won't have access to this AI on Mars.But that's really what is -- is driving him. Driving his whole life.STU: It's really, really hard.Because I know, it feels creepy. And there are risks. And all of that.But it's like, it's really, really hard to think about telling someone, who is paralyzed that, no. We could make you move. But we don't want to pursue that technology.Like, I don't know. I mean, it's just -- it's such incredible technology.And for all of the other stuff, that he's done. Which is really impressive. I mean, Elon Musk is an impressive dude.Space travel. You know, the electric car stuff. I don't care about the electric car stuff that much. But it's still really impressive what he's been able to do.Everyone basically said, you couldn't do it. And no other company could be able to do that. He did that. He's done so many incredible things. But if he was able to take people, you know, with disabilities. And all these -- these issues that have been unsolvable throughout all of human history, and somehow figure out a way to -- through Neuralink or something similar, to solve that for people, it would be the greatest thing he has ever accomplished by a long shot.GLENN: So my daughter Mary had brain surgery, about three, four years ago.STU: Yeah. I remember.GLENN: And it was perfect for a long time.All of her seizures went away. Earlier this year, I think it was in the summer, she started to have breakthrough seizures.And they are even on medication now, they are grand mal. They are --STU: Hmm.GLENN: They're just terrifying. And -- and I said to her, this was about four years ago.I said, honey, if you wait. Elon Musk is doing experience with Neuralink.And one of the things that Neuralink will do. Is it will -- you know, patch all of the brain damage.It will take where -- when you have a stroke, it's like a highway.And there's you all these highways running to different parts of your brain. And if you have a stroke, that highway is cut.So there are other paths to get to where it's going, but it make",-6,,-6
BECKNews_27," The United States is yet again on the verge of a government shutdown as House Republicans work to cut spending. But is that really a bad thing as the media has suggested? Glenn and Pat debunk some of the myths surrounding this current shutdown debate and review a ""60 Minutes"" report that details what your tax dollars are actually funding. Did you know that your money is bailing out small businesses in Ukraine? Meanwhile, here at home, small businesses are suffering under inflation. ""We are destroying ourselves,"" Glenn warns, as the Biden administration depletes our munitions and oil supplies. So, maybe it's about time for a government shutdown.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Oh, man, I am so concerned about the government shutdown. And Pat is here to share my panic.PAT: Oh man. I am scared. I am scared.GLENN: What are we going to do? PAT: I don't know. Same thing we always will, only it will be better. Because they are spending less of our money.GLENN: But can they? Can they spend less of our money? PAT: Well, they have to if the government shuts down, which is the beauty of a government shutdown.They have to do all the necessary things. Like pay off the Social Security benefits and the veterans benefits, and all of that. They have to continue to do that, and they do.STU: Yeah, including the interest.PAT: Right. Right.STU: You notice they're not talking about defaulting on the debt this time. That's weird.PAT: That is weird.GLENN: That was their biggest concern. We will default on the at the time. I haven't heard word one on defaulting on the debt.PAT: I haven't either.GLENN: That's weird. Now they're trying to say, you know these Republicans, they want to have a government shutdown. Because they want to shut down the ATF. Yeah. Yeah. At least we're honest about it. You know, all the things you want to do. Oh, how dare you, we want to take guns away. We love guns. I was kissing mine last night. Oh, I cleaned the tongue. I cleaned the barrel of my gun with my tongue, I love it so much.Shut up!PAT: And while we're at it, maybe the FBI too. Maybe that can go as well. Maybe that can go.GLENN: And I don't know. The IRS. That wouldn't be a bad thing.PAT: Yeah. Department of Education. Yeah. Get rid of all the nonessential nonsense.GLENN: Yeah. Kevin McCarthy says, we're not going to default.We have a number of days until funding runs out.Do you know what we didn't have until -- until 1980.Government shutdowns?We never had them.If -- you know, if the budget wasn't done, and it happened many times, you know, since 1776. The budget wasn't done. They just went on, and no big deal. The budget will be finished soon.But now, after 1980, I wonder what changed.PAT: Huh.GLENN: I wonder what changed. Because now we have to shut it down.No. We really don't. We really don't. It's all funny money in the first place, you know.PAT: That's for sure.GLENN: So the -- the House Republicans are working hard today, to get everybody on the same page.And that is, yeah. We should stop spending all of this -- this money.You know.And what do you say? We start with a few things. Like, no. The taxpayer shouldn't pay for abortions.And send people on a vacation. At our expense.And then at the end of that vacation, they have an abortion. No. Uh-uh.No. No. I don't think so. Uh-uh.PAT: How do you feel about the money going to Ukraine though? You love this for small business loans?GLENN: Well, now, hold on just a second.We're trying to help them win a war. Let me -- let me give you a couple of clips, from CBS.When was the last time 60 Minutes actually did something where, he cared about.PAT: Yeah.GLENN: Well, they did this weekend. Listen to this from 60 Minutes. Cut one. VOICE: What Americans have to pay is financing more than just weapons. We've discovered the US governments are buying seeds and fertilizer for Ukrainian farmers, and covering the salaries of Ukraine's first responders.VOICE: Yeah. Yeah, 57,000 of them. That includes between the trains. This rescue dog named, Joy, to comb through the wreckage of Russian strikes and looking for survivors.GLENN: Okay. I don't mind helping that one.VOICE: And the US also funds the divers who we saw clearing unexploded ammunition from the country --GLENN: Maybe that. Maybe. VOICE: To make them safe again. The swimming and fishing. Russia's invasion shrank Ukraine's economy by about a third. We were surprised to find that to keep it afloat, the US government is subsidizing small businesses. GLENN: Wait. What. Hold it. Now, the dog thing. Okay. If we can help out on the dog thing, fine.PAT: And it seems to be connected to the war.GLENN: Yeah. And finding the unexploded bombs in the rivers.Okay. Okay. But wait a minute. Wait a minute. Paying 56,000 firefighters to show up.You know we're also paying the government salaries. And we're paying the people's Social Security. Okay?We're not even paying it here.And every dollar that we print to send over there, is causing inflation, here.So while our -- while we're getting poorer and poorer, it's almost like he designed it to be this way. While we're getting poorer and poorer, they're -- they're getting bailed out by our government. And every time we send a dollar over there, you get poorer.And it's not because it's taking money.It's because we're printing money. Inflation.So now we find out, that they're also, they're not helping small businesses here.No. No. No.When we had COVID. No. Home Depot.Sure. Home Depot. I mean, they're safe.But the Ma and pop stores, they're completely unsafe.Huh! And now we're paying.But wait, there's more. Cut two.VOICE: Russia's invasion shrank Ukraine's economy by about a third. We were surprised to find that to keep it afloat, the US government is subsidizing small businesses, like Tatiana's mid-ware company.PAT: Oh.VOICE: That's cute.GLENN: Oh, that is very nice.VOICE: This fashion is a condition of war. We have to work. We have to pay taxes. We have to pay --GLENN: Taxes. Oh, no.VOICE: To our employees. We have to work. Don't stop.VOICE: Why does that help Ukraine win the war?VOICE: Because economy, it's a foundation of advocacy. It's an aid from government, but it's an aid, say, from their heart of every ordinary American person.GLENN: Okay. So wait. Hang on just a second. I'm not sure all that aid is from the heart of every American. Because we didn't know. If they would have asked us to help out, we would have been -- we would have been great. We are the most charitable nation in the history of the world.PAT: And we would. We do give charitably.GLENN: Correct.PAT: More than the rest of the world, combined.GLENN: Correct. But instead, they went through our government. And our government didn't tell us what they're doing. And they are doing things that are causing us pain. And not just pain.What's happening here is, we are destroying ourselves. We're giving them all of our tanks and ammunition, that we are now dangerously low.Dangerously low.We don't have enough howitzer shells in you, to do any kind of war.And we can only make 25,000 of those, a month.Russia is using 60,000 a day.A day. So I don't know.I don't feel comfortable with this.We've also destroyed our own oil supply. Our strategic oil reserve, almost gone. We're destroying our ability to make oil, to find oil. To find oil. To refine it into gasoline. And yet, we're sending stuff over there.We're letting everybody have whatever they want over there.Including fertilizer.Which our farmers are being told, we can't use any more, because of global warming.Huh. Now, that's weird. How come it's okay for Ukraine. But not for us.You haven't even passed a farm bill over here, to help our farmers.But we're buying their grain over there. Which, by the way, because they're getting free grain.They're planting crops. They can now sell it at such a low cost. That Poland has said, you're killing our farmers.We can't support you anymore, Ukraine.See what happens when man starts to get involved in ways that he shouldn't get involved?See what happens? All of the unexpected consequences that come from this?Or maybe they are expected.So now, the Biden administration is requesting over $20 billion more. We wondered how they were paying for it.We wondered where it was going.Well, there are some things that you should probably know.There is -- there is some questioning of some of the people that were in the administration over there.And part of the group that was getting the money, and divvying it out. I think about 60 of them now, are actually being investigated.Or going to jail. Or have lost their jobs.Because they were corrupt. And taking and using our money for other things.I just didn't know we were paying for everything over there.Things that we wouldn't pay for us, over here.Didn't know that. Just --PAT: Nobody did.Except the administration.Until Sunday, with 60 Minutes.GLENN: Yeah. And USAID. Which is now run by Cass Sunstein's wife.Remember her?She's in charge of USAID. And that's where all this money is coming from. And being distributed through.Now, one last thing.You know, that lady at least sounded grateful.I want you to listen to the Ukrainian's -- hmm. Tell us how they really feel about our money. Your money. Listen.VOICE: The country is fighting formal its survival. Bankrolled in large part by US taxpayers.The outcome may be decided by America's willingness to keep paying.VOICE: Some Americans say, we're very sympathetic to you, Americans. But we're going through tough times at home, and we just can't afford to keep supporting you.VOICE: Ukrainians pay with their lives.GLENN: Ukrainians pay with their lives. And...VOICE: And I believe all their lives are much more than money. Much more than taxpayer's money.GLENN: Their lives count much more than taxpayer's money. Yeah. It does. It does.Although, nobody asked us. Now, this is what Joe Biden is talking about, when he calls for -- when he's saying, it's going to be a government shutdown.You don't have to shut it down. Just agree to send any more money to Congress.And then propose exactly what you want. And exactly where it's going.Go through the proper channels for it. But you don't want to do that. Because you know.I mean, I find it amazing. That CBS and 60 Minutes. Ran this right at the beginning of the budget stuff.STU: Yeah. Incredible.GLENN: That says something.STU: Yeah. It does. It says, even they are getting fed up now with the shenanigans of this administration.GLENN: Hopefully.PAT: I hope so.And I think, you know, we talked about this a little bit yesterday. But I think even the liberals in the media, are disgusted with this president.And they see the fact.And even if they're not disgusted. They understand he's a problem. And he might not win.Because people are seeing, how compromised he is, mentally and physically. And so this might be part of encouraging him to exit.GLENN: By the way, we now have photos of the ambassador -- the American ambassador, that was over in Ukraine.Meeting twice with the Burisma official. After being told the firm was corrupt.So we were told, that they didn't know anything. It's impossible to not know that Burisma and the head of Burisma was a total oligarch, that literally beheads the people, that -- that are in his way. And our American ambassador was told, as was Joe Biden, don't meet with these guys.Don't. They're really, really bad. But the Burisma official, who worked closely with Hunter Biden was invited to two separate events, by the US ambassador.For what reason? For what reason?After she was told, have no contact with this person.What was going on? What is still going on?Why are we bankrupt America. This isn't America 1960, 1940. We have lost our manufacturing base. We are now in the midst of losing our cheap energy. And we have lost our cheap labor.So what made America, America, in the 1940s, '50s, and '60s was, we had cheap labor. We had abundant, cheap energy. We had all of our natural resources. And nobody else had anything.Well, now we don't have those things. Because they've been taken off the table.And now when we do a marshal plan, by the way, in inflation-aged numbers, we are only about $50 billion away, and Joe Biden wants another 20 billion today. We're about $50 billion away, from the cost of the entire marshal plan.Which rebuilt Europe.PAT: Wow.GLENN: Where is all that money? Where is all that money?And had you --PAT: And what you want to bet, we're past that already. In reality. We don't have any idea.GLENN: Correct.So when they say, we have some extremists, that want to shut the government down.I don't think it's extremist.I really don't. With all the corruption, which we'll get into here in a second.All the corruption that seems to be everywhere now.Everywhere. All these deals being made with foreign countries by our senators. And our House members.On top of that, the incredible spending!I think it would be a good idea to shut it down.   The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up.

New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy people on the left. The AOC's have taken over, places in the media.And places like this in New York.This is what it is thousand. So there's been one case. One. One in the entire seven years. Where they did this.Where they shut down a company, that had no obvious victims.The case was 1972.And it was a company, relatively small company, that was writing term papers, for college students. Okay.So I want to write my paper.GLENN: I want to break out in God bless America.STU: Capitalism is pretty impressive. A",-6,,-6
BECKNews_28," Were living in unique times, Glenn says&which seems to be proven DAILY thanks to the LGBTQ+ movement. For example, transgender activists recently spoke out about the importance of abortion rights for trans women (so, actual men), and Demi Lovato just released a charming new song commemorating the overturning of Roe v Wade (Glenn plays a piece of it in this clip). But perhaps worse of all, at least one attendee at a recent New York Drag March could be heard exclaiming Were coming for your children! during march chants. But why would these activists actually ADMIT that?! Glenn and Stu discuss what may be the worst strategy ever, and they discuss who is REALLY losing out thanks to the radical transgender movement&     The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart.

Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy people on the left. The AOC's have taken over, places in the media.And places like this in New York.This is what it is thousand. So there's been one case. One. One in the entire seven years. Where they did this.Where they shut down a company, that had no obvious victims.The case was 1972.And it was a company, relatively small company, that was writing term papers, for college students. Okay.So I want to write my paper.GLENN: I want to break out in God bless America.STU: Capitalism is pretty impressive. Apparently, this didn't go over that well.What they said, there were no obvious victims here. The people bought the term papers. They didn't want to write them. They got the term papers. They said, they were defrauding the education system.GLENN: Which they were.STU: This is the one time. And it's a small tiny company. Let me give you the other times they've done this.Tell me if any of these sound like, hey, I have a good interest rate, on a loan I paid back.Number one, a breast cancer nonprofit was shut down a dozen years ago. For using nearly all its $9 million in donations to pay for director's salaries, perks, and other expenses, instead of funding free mammograms. Okay.So they told everyone, donate money for free. Mammograms. And they just took all the money for themselves.That's number one. Number two, a private equity timber.Faking big investment success, was closed down after stealing millions of dollars from thousands of investors.Okay?You can see.GLENN: Yeah. Got it. But on both of those so far, you have hundreds of thousands of people, you know, I'm sure. That gave -- they're all victims.They gave their money.STU: Yeah. And they didn't get the thing that they want.GLENN: They didn't get the thing they were promised. You have all these people going to the AG. Saying, hey, this is a real problem here. This has to stop. Not here.GLENN: Not here.STU: Another one. Mental health facility, shuttered for looting $4 million from public funds, while neglecting patients.GLENN: Okay. Kind of a big one.STU: Pretty clear. An auto lender that allegedly charged hidden interest rates, got to stay in business last year if it paid a fine and didn't commit fraud in the future.So here's one they didn't shut down.They actually let them go on.They're going after Trump in all of this. In this one, they're like, oh. Sure, they're hidden fees.They're not telling you about them.GLENN: Okay.STU: A judge requested.A judge refused to request to shut down a river rafting company in 2011.After a customer drowned, and the attorney general showed it was repeatedly using unlicensed guides, or none at all.Instead, he ordered only a 50,000-dollar bond and cleanup -- for him to clean up his act.The company is still being run today, under a different name by the same family. Someone died.GLENN: We have thousands of victims.And in this case, somebody who is dead.STU: Is dead!GLENN: Dead!STU: They're like, you guys can stay open -- and then this one is my favorite one. A judge in 2001.Declined to appoint a receiver, to take over a porn site, despite millions of dollars of illegal credit card charges to hundreds of customers.Who thought they were getting a free tour.Now, look, you're -- you want to get the free -- you want to know what you're subscribing for, Glenn. Before you just pulled the trigger on that. So you put your credit card information into a porn site, I think some of these victims need some life changes to be made here.But they put their credit card into a porn site. Expecting a free tour.They instead, get charged and charged and charged and charged.In fact, once the owners of the site were caught, they attempted to move their money overseas, to avoid any penalty.Still, the judge said, appointing a receiver was an extraordinary remedy!That should be used sparingly, and that a preliminary injunction was good enough.Only after all that happened, it they find out, the people running the porn site, were the Gambino crime family.(laughter)I kid you not. The Gambino crime family.GLENN: And they didn't go into receivership.STU: So there you go. Think about that.I mean, it's so obvious, what they're doing. Latitia james talked about it when she ran.Her goal was to take this one individual out.And the New York -- the voters of New York, said, good.Go do it.And now she's doing it.GLENN: Okay. If you are -- if you have business in in New York, if you're in New York, I'm just telling you. You have to do what you have to do.There's no way, I would keep my business in New York.There is no rule of law now. You know it on the streets. But there is no rule of law. If they can get away with this. They can do anything to you.   Elon Musk has announced that the first Neuralink patient can now control a computer mouse by just thinking. But while this technology could help a lot of people, should we proceed with caution? Between AI and this new merger of man and machine, Glenn gives a warning about what the future could hold. Glenn and Stu also review the controversy surrounding Googles Gemini AI, which refused to generate images of white people.     Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: So the website, Down Detector, detected a surge in outage reports from users at AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Customer Cellular, Boost Mobile, US Cellular, and Straight Talk.That the reports of the system being downed or outages, began at 3:45 a.m. Eastern time. The outages have been reported across many major US cities.It looks like, that it is back up. I'm not sure.They say, they don't think this was a cyber attack.But how did all of them go down at the same time?I mean, that's kind of weird.Yesterday, Israel had a cyber attack.It was from Iran. The Israelis say. And it was an attack on their cell phone services.So quite a coincidence. But let's not jump to any conclusions. Let's see what actually happened.Cyber attacks are going to happen. At some point, soon. We will have cyber attacks. And it will leave you vulnerable, if that's what you depend on.We are becoming more and more, a society that is connected in all things, and absolutely incapable of doing any things, without our electronics.We hit a milestone yesterday. This is truly like landing a man on the moon, I think. This is -- this is the first real merging of man and machine, I think. I mean, we've had the electronic. You know, the bionic arms and things like that.But this is in your mind.It's Neuralink. Elon Musk came up with it. And it is really tempting, because this is -- you know, this will be great to some degree. You'll be able to access information, and have the old internet in your head. You want to speak French?Okay. Download it. Got it.I mean, it is really -- isn't that the Matrix?STU: Yeah. The Matrix too. We're turning into The Matrix. That's the theme of the show today. GLENN: So that is now the beginnings of that, happened and was announced yesterday. Elon Musk said, Neuralink is active in the first person, to have one of the chips implanted in their brain. They have seemingly made a full recovery.We -- you know, so far. We don't know what the effects of this are, or will be. But Musk said, the patient can now move the mouse around a screen, just by thinking.So he has Bluetoothed himself to the screen.Crazy. Huh.STU: It's incredible that they can do that. And, you know, also, look at the way Elon Musk does business.This is a lot of what he does. Which is a lot of kind of just -- let's try it. There's a lot of -- hey, let's give it a whirl.GLENN: He said I think yesterday or earlier this week, that he had plans by 2029, to have a million people on Mars.And when I heard that, I thought, there's no -- oh, it's Elon Musk. Maybe.STU: Well, yeah. And this is his goal, with all of this stuff. He has -- I think it's a T-shirt or something. He wears. Like occupy mars.This is the central idea of his life.GLENN: And this is part of it. Neuralink is part of it.He believes that we are on such a dystopian track right now. That because of global warming, but also because of AI.He believes AI is just as dangerous as global warming. He believes we cannot compete with AI.Unless we can merge with it. Okay.Because it will be operating at such high speeds. We don't have the processing capabilities for the speeds.You know, it's kind of like -- kind of like dogs. Dog life. Seven years. One year for us.It's like one year is a thousand years for AI.So it's moving at such a rapid speed, we won't be able to keep up. So he believes that we need to be able to merge with the machine, until we can get off, this planet.I don't think he'll be taking Neuralink with him. Or maybe he just thinks we won't have access to this AI on Mars.But that's really what is -- is driving him. Driving his whole life.STU: It's really, really hard.Because I know, it feels creepy. And there are risks. And all of that.But it's like, it's really, really hard to think about telling someone, who is paralyzed that, no. We could make you move. But we don't want to pursue that technology.Like, I don't know. I mean, it's just -- it's such incredible technology.And for all of the other stuff, that he's done. Which is really impressive. I mean, Elon Musk is an impressive dude.Space travel. You know, the electric car stuff. I don't care about the electric car stuff that much. But it's still really impressive what he's been able to do.Everyone basically said, you couldn't do it. And no other company could be able to do that. He did that. He's done so many incredible things. But if he was able to take people, you know, with disabilities. And all these -- these issues that have been unsolvable throughout all of human history, and somehow figure out a way to -- through Neuralink or something similar, to solve that for people, it would be the greatest thing he has ever accomplished by a long shot.GLENN: So my daughter Mary had brain surgery, about three, four years ago.STU: Yeah. I remember.GLENN: And it was perfect for a long time.All of her seizures went away. Earlier this year, I think it was in the summer, she started to have breakthrough seizures.And they are even on medication now, they are grand mal. They are --STU: Hmm.GLENN: They're just terrifying. And -- and I said to her, this was about four years ago.I said, honey, if you wait. Elon Musk is doing experience with Neuralink.And one of the things that Neuralink will do. Is it will -- you know, patch all of the brain damage.It will take where -- when you have a stroke, it's like a highway.And there's you all these highways running to different parts of your brain. And if you have a stroke, that highway is cut.So there are other paths to get to where it's going, but it makes it much slower. And sometimes it can't just get to where it's supposed to go.STU: You can't get there from here.GLENN: You can't get there from here.So Neuralink will connect the different parts of the br",0,,0
BECKNews_29," Canada may soon start censoring and regulating streaming services and social media platforms and forcing podcasters to register with the government. ""You don't want a regulated 'Internet Podcast Council,'"" Glenn warns. And he believes it probably won't be long before leftists try passing similar laws in the United States. Glenn speaks with Toronto Sun political columnist Brian Lilley, who gave one of Glenn's favorite responses to the Canadian government on X: ""Go to hell."" Brian reveals the disturbing way Canada is trying to sneak these new regulations past its citizens and whether or not this is the beginning of a much larger attempt to silence voices.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Canada is now on the track to censor and regulate streaming services and social media platforms.They're -- they've got more regulation coming. Podcasters are going to have to register now, with the Canadian radio television and telecommunications commission.That's like our FCC.You don't want a regulated internet podcast council. The online streaming ad, formerly bill C11 goes into effect, November 28th. Meaning any online streaming service, that operates in Canada. Generates revenue of more than 10 million, in any given year, will have to register with CRTC. That's the Canadian government. Pitches the new rule as a modern broadcasting framework that can adapt to changing circumstances. To do that, we need broad engagement. And robust, public records. It requires those podcasters to register with the government, only once, and collect all of its basic information from them. They have a new streaming service having to provide information about their activities in Canada.Wow. That doesn't sound dystopian at all.One of our friends to the program, actually wrote, I think, one of the better comebacks, for this.Brian Lilley wrote the CRTC, now wants to regulate the podcast.Here's my simple message to them: Go to hell. Brian Lilley is on the phone with us now from Canada. Hello, Brian.BRIAN: Hello, Glenn. I didn't think I would be able to say ""go to hell"" on the program. I thought I would have to say ""go to Pat Gray's hometown."" But, you know, there you said it. So I can say it. But I can also say it in Canada. In the future, I don't know. This is a bizarre act. Because you guys follow politics closely. Sometimes politicians pass a law. It's very descriptive. And it details everything.I wish they passed a broad law, and then they would lead the rest up to regulations.So, you know, some people are saying, well, this podcast registry, and the whole bill will lead to censorship. And the defenders are saying. No. No.It won't. I'm saying, actually, it could.And that's a problem. Because so much of it is left up to regulation of our broadcast regulator, which has done such a bang-up job.That they'll regulate the internet now. Check out the website. It looks like it was built for the Netscape Navigator era.GLENN: So are you concerned about -- I mean, they have done everything they could to shut you up. To shut up Rebel News. Toronto Sun. All of this stuff. How concerned are you, that this is the beginning of the shutdown of voices in Canada?BRIAN: I am concerned. And I'll give you an example from a podcast episode, that we just dropped today.So there was a podcast called full comment.My employer. They own the Toronto Sun, and a bunch of other newspapers. Conservative media newspaper, like National Post.And interviewed this woman named Katherine Birbalsingh, and she's known as a strict head mistress. Maybe you've heard of her. She runs the school. Inner City London. The kids have to walk through the hallways silently. There's dress codes. There's strict measures in place. There's expectations. Traditional curriculum.I tell you that that is going to upset a lot of people in the education system in this country, just like it will with yours. People believe, there should be no rules.That the kids should be at the center of everything. The kids don't matter.You know, if this is in place, somebody could complain. Then that podcast will be taken down.I'm not saying that will happen. But the rules are in such a way that anybody you say, that upsets anybody, who is on the progressive side. That could definitely end up taking away -- you know, my ability to put forward interesting ideas and information.GLENN: So do you know about Chloe Cole?BRIAN: Yes.GLENN: Okay. So Chloe Cole has detransitioned, and is on the speaking tour all the time now. Speaking out. She's a brave, brave girl. And she was speaking out how bad it was for her when she was 11 to 12. And she had her breasts removed. And she can't have children most likely.And it's bad. Really bad.She was giving an event, gets the treatments and surgeries, on minors.She was, you know, going to speak at a ticket -- ticketed event.And Eventbrite deplatformed the event, because it violated their policy on hateful, violent, and dangerous events.Now, how is that -- how does that make sense to anybody?BRIAN: Well, it -- it doesn't. And that's why I am using this podcast registry.There's a lot of incidents where it ends up being self-censorship on corporations, or Jordan Peterson's case.You know, I know you've talked to him just a couple of weeks ago, after he lost to the College of Psychologists of Ontario. He had to undergo reeducation training.GLENN: Is he going to do it?BRIAN: No. I think he told them to go to hell in Montana, and he's challenging them in court.And last I talked to them, he was still quite defined, as he should be.But we've got enough self-censorship already.We don't need this. And while I understand, that we can update the Broadcasting Act. There's certain things that need to be done.The Trudeau government said, we need to update the Broadcast Act. Great. Let's put in all kinds of stuff that could lead to bad places.Let's make it so our civil servants. Our appointees will control what can be said, online.Because they said, they wouldn't control social media. Then they came right out and said, yes, we will.If you're broadcasting. So if you're doing what Tucker Carlson does. On X. And you start promising videos.You're going to be regulated.And as they said, well, we're just regulating the online streamers.We're regulating the platforms. Not the individual users.That's like saying, I'm going to regulate the highways. But not the individual drivers.You know, pass all these new rules on how we have to drive on the highway. That doesn't supply individual drivers on the highway.GLENN: And it also, it also -- if they say, we will just do this to the platforms. Well, then the platforms will enforce it.That's what's happening here in America. They're just saying, what do we have to do to impress upon you, your responsibility to stop this kind of talk.We can come up with some harsh regulations for you, you know.Then they self-regulate.Then they do all the butcheries. So the government doesn't have to.Sounds like a very difficult thing.BRIAN: It really is. In fact, Chloe Cole, you mentioned earlier. We're having a big debate in this country over parental rights around gender identity in the school.And activists can change their name. Their gender pronoun in school.Mom and dad cannot find out. Well, this thing in our media is very controversial. A poll out, just a couple of weeks ago, showed 78 percent believed that the parents should know.That's not a controversial position. The 14 percent, should think, mom and dad, shouldn't be told.That's where our Prime Minister is, by the way.You put all of that into this context of the regulators deciding what the rules are, for what you can say online.We're in a very dangerous place.And so this -- this is a horrible bill.I've been screaming about it, since they introduced it.It went through a whole election. And had to reintroduce it. Because it didn't pass in time. And the conservatives really tried to get young people, especially to be interested in this. And they couldn't be.We had our last election in the middle of COVID. Justin Trudeau scared suburban moms into voting for them.If they didn't vote for them. We would all get COVID to die. Or not be allowed to have abortions with a gun to your head.GLENN: Well, I know you're busy. Guys up in Canada, have to celebrate another Nazi I think today. So --BRIAN: Well, you know, I'm sure we can find stuff. We can Russell stuff up.GLENN: Well, you don't have to. Because the Russian disinformation leap will provide them for you. You just have to root them out.BRIAN: Of all the things of our prime ministers to do.Like, you know, he -- he is talking about Russian disinformation.He just gave them all the ammunition they need to sit there and say, Ukraine is full of Nazis.Because he had Zelinsky applaud one.And then says, well, it's not my fault.I didn't do any vetting.It's kind of your job when you're the leader of the country. Or your staff's job. Make sure that a foreign visit goes well.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah. I would be -- I have seen Ronald Reagan. Or really any president.I say that. I should say, anybody on the right. Bringing up an old Nazi. And we should really celebrate this guy.They bring up old Marxists from time to time. But not Nazis.All right. Best of luck you to, man.GLENN: Thank you, guys. Guess Canada is out.Not going to be able to go there.   The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires?

New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy people on the left. The AOC's have taken over, places in the media.And places like this in New York.This is what it is thousand. So there's been one case. One. One in the entire seven years. Where they did this.Where they shut down a company, that had no obvious victims.The case was 1972.And it was a company, relatively small company, that was writing term papers, for college students. Okay.So I want to write my paper.GLENN: I want to break out in God bless America.STU: Capitalism is pretty impressive. Apparently, this didn't go over that well.What they said, there were no obvious victims here. The people bought the term papers. They didn't want to write them. They got the term papers. They said, they were defrauding the education system.GLENN: Which they were.STU: This is the one time. And it's a small tiny company. Let me give you the other times they've done this.Tell me if any of these sound like, hey, I have a good interest rate, on a loan I paid back.Number one, a breast cancer nonprofit was shut down a dozen years ago. For using nearly all its $9 million in donations to pay for director's salaries, perks, and other expenses, instead of funding free mammograms. Okay.So they told everyone, donate money for free. Mammograms. And they just took all the money for themselves.That's number one. Number two, a private equity timber.Faking big investment success, was closed down after stealing millions of dollars from thousands of investors.Okay?You can see.GLENN: Yeah. Got it. But on both of those so far, you have hundreds of thousands of people, you know, I'm sure. That gave -- they're all victims.They gave their money.STU: Yeah. And they didn't get the thing that they want.GLENN: They didn't get the thing they were promised. You have all these people going to the AG. Saying, hey, this is a real problem here. This has to stop. Not here.GLENN: Not here.STU: Another one. Mental health facility, shuttered for looting $4 million from public funds, while neglecting patients.GLENN: Okay. Kind of a big one.STU: Pretty clear. An auto lender that allegedly charged hidden interest rates, got to stay in business last year if it paid a fine and didn't commit fraud in the future.So here's one they didn't shut down.They actually let them go on.They're going after Trump in all of this. In this one, they're like, oh. Sure, they're hidden fees.They're not telling you about them.GLENN: Okay.STU: A judge requested.A judge refused to request to shut down a river rafting company in 2011.After a customer drowned, and the attorney general showed it was repeatedly using unlicensed guides, or none at all.Instead, he ordered only a 50,000-dollar bond and cleanup -- for him to clean up his act.The company is still being run today, under a different name by the same family. Someone died.GLENN: We have thousands of victims.And in this case, somebody who is dead.STU: Is dead!GLENN: Dead!STU: They're like, you guys can stay open -- and then this one is my favorite one. A judge in 2001.Declined to appoint a receiver, to take over a porn site, despite millions of dollars of illegal credit card charges to hundreds of customers.Who thought they were getting a free tour.Now, look, you're -- you want to get the free -- you want to know what you're subscribing for, Glenn. Before you just pulled the trigger on that. So you put your credit card information into a porn site, I think some of these victims need some life changes to be made here.But they put their credit card into a porn site. Expecting a free tour.They instead, get charged and charged and charged and charged.In fact, once the owners of the site were caught, they attempted to move their money overseas, to avoid any penalty.Still, the judge said, appointing a receiver was an extraordinary remedy!That should be used sparingly, and that a preliminary injunction was good enough.Only after all that happened, it they find out, the people running the porn site, were the Gambino crime family",-7,,-7
BECKNews_30,"WRITER  Have YOU felt disillusioned by the mainstream media? You wouldn??t be alone. Conservatives have increasingly felt jaded and targeted by the mainstream media, even by seemingly ??right-leaning?? outlets like Fox News who are allegedly supposed to represent them.  There??s a reason why conservatives feel this way.  In an exclusive bombshell news story, Blaze Media uncovered the dark side of Fox News from whistleblowers inside the network. In fact, insiders revealed that Fox is subsidizing the very left-wing activist groups that ""ise and seek the ruin of the network's viewers."" You read that right: Fox News matched donations to left-wing activist groups, including match donations to the Satanic Temple, the Trevor Project, Planned Parenthood (and local Planned Parenthood branches), the Southern Poverty Law Center , and MORE.  It comes as no surprise then, that a Fox insider told Glenn's executive producer, Rikki Ratliff-Fellman, that the network is evidencing a ""complete disregard and hatred"" for its core audience.

Soros-funded RINO judges have been elected in some of the highest courts in Texas. These judges implemented restrictions that have blocked nearly a thousand cases of voter fraud from b""ng investigated or prosecuted from across the state. These new restrictions are similar to ones in place in states like George, Arizona, and Wisconsin, leaving Texas more susceptible to election corruption than ever. If Texas falls to corruption, America will lose its largest bastion of conservative electoral power in the nation. Without Texas, Republicans WILL NOT be able to win national elections and liberal corruption will go unchecked across the country.  Fortunately, there is a way to stop this: YOU. If you live in Texas you have a chance to stand up against corruption and to fight back! Starting Tuesday, February 20th, early voting for the primaries begins, where three of these judges are up for election. Go out and vote. If the right people are voted in, there's a good chance the restrictions will be lifted and election fraud can once again be prosecuted.  But remember, you can't just go in and vote for anyone who has an ""R"" next to their name. Sorors knows that a registered Democrat would never stand a chance in Texas, so his lackeys register as Republicans and ride the little ""R"" right into office. So who do you vote for?  Fortunately, Glenn had Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on his show today and Ken gave us his list of judges that he vouches for. His list is as follows:    WRITER  Who is really banning books? For years now, Conservatives have been taking flak from the left for supposed ""book bans."" The left likes to compare these ""bans"" to Nazi book burnings, accusing the right of sweeping authoritarian decrees designed to suppress information. In reality, this is a movement largely motivated by parents, who want to remove inappropriate books from children's libraries.  But if you want to discuss authoritarian book bans, look no further than the White House. As Glenn recently covered, the Biden administration has been pressuring the world's largest bookseller, Amazon, into suppressing books they disagree with. On February 5th, 2024, Ohio Representative Jim Jordan released a slew of subpoenaed documents that exposed pressure placed on Amazon by the Biden Administration. The documents, which Jordan dubbed ""The Amazon Files"" after Elon Musk's ""The Twitter Files,"" revealed an email conversation between Andrew Slavitt, a former White House senior adviser, and Amazon employees. In these emails, Slavitt complained that the top search results for books on ""vaccines"" were ""concerning"" and then requested that Amazon intervene. Amazon initially refused, not out of some altruistic concern for the free exchange of information. They thought any action taken would be ""too visible"" and would further exasperate the ??Harry/Sally narrative,?? referring to the outrage that followed Amazon's removal of Ryan T. Anderson??s book When Harry Became Sally.  Despite this initial refusal, Amazon agreed to meet with the White House a few days later. The number one item on their agenda was""oving books from the website. An Amazon employee even admitted that the reason they even took this meeting was due to the pressure being placed on them by the Biden Administration.  What was the result of this meeting? Amazon caved. They began to implement ways of limiting the outreach of books that challenged the mainstream vaccine narrative and other books the White House might not like. The White House was caught red-handed pressuring the world's largest bookseller to restrict the sale of books they consider in opposition to their narrative, and they have the gall to accuse conservatives of information suppression. This is just ONE of many actions committed by the Biden Administration that are more characteristic of a dictator than a president. What can you do about it? Fortunately, you are not dependent on Amazon and its corrupted algorithm to help you find books. Every week right here on GlennBeck.com, we highlight books that Glenn is reading or talking about in our ""Glenn's Bookshelf"" series. Here you can find a wide selection of books free from Amazon's filters. Be sure to sign up for Glenn's newsletter to find out about new additions to ""Glenn's Bookshelf"" every week.    WRITER   The left-wing media's most recent tirade is accusing Trump of being a dictator. But, as Glenn said, ""Everything they're accusing us of, they're doing."" Since day one, the Biden administration has overstepped the bounds placed on the executive branch set by the Constitution. In Glenn's most recent TV Special, he examined ten times Biden acted like a dictator, NOT a president. Here are 10 of Biden's Dictator Moves, and click HERE to get ALL of the research that went into this week's Glenn TV special:     WRITER   Every day it seems Glenn covers another story revealing how people across the world at all levels of power DESPISE the fact that YOU have rights, and they are actively trying to curtail them. Recently, there has been a string of attacks against the rights outlined in the First Amendment: the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, the freedom of assembly, and the freedom to petition. As a refresher, the First Amendment reads as follows: This is powerful stuff, there is a good reason the Founding Fathers made it the FIRST Amendment. It's also the reason why power-hungry elites are attacking it. These attacks are designed to control the way you think, speak, and believe, vote, what you read, and who holds your representatives responsible. The First Amendment is our strongest weapon against tyrants, and they know it. So what can you do about it? Hope that some wig in Washinton will eventually do something? We know how well that works. The best thing to do is to stay active, engage in the issues you care about, and exercise your rights.  So where to start? Here are a few things YOU can do to protect your First Amendment rights:                                Religion                                   The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is toyou guessed itpractice your faith. Become an active member in your place of worship, go to scripture studies, invite your friends to that late afternoon event, and walk the life. This can impact the way you spend money as well. Shop the businesses and brands that share your values, and don't shop at the ones that scorn them. Keeping the community alive and healthy is the best way to ensure that generations to come will be able to experience the freedom you enjoy.                              Speech                                   Much like religion, the best way to protect your freedom of speech is... to speak. Engage your friends and family in polite, civil conversation. Stand up for what you believe in, and make your case to your peers. Just remember to keep it friendly. No one ever won an argument by shouting down their opponent. The civil exchange of ideas is the cornerstone of our republic, and a dialogue where the participants are well-informed, considerate, compassionate, and open-minded can have permanent impacts on all involved.                              Press                                   Freedom of the Press seems a little tricky at first. Unless you work for the media, what are you supposed to do? Quit your job and go work for the local newspaper? The good news is that exercising this right is not nearly that difficult. In fact, you are currently doing it. The best thing you can do is to read from outlets that produce informative content. Want to know what Glenn consumes to stay informed every day?

Assembly                                    Anna Moneymaker / Staff | Getty ImagesFreedom of assembly is one of the more impactful yet underutilized freedoms in the First Amendment. Peaceably assembling and protesting with like-minded individuals can hugely influence politicians and policies while simultaneously creating community and fellowship between attendees. It's understandable why more people don't turn out. We're all busy people with busy schedules, and flying out to D.C. for the weekend seems like a daunting task to many. Thankfully, you don't have to go out all the way to D.C. to make a difference. Gather some like-minded people in your town and bring awareness to issues that impact your community. Big change starts locally, and exercising your freedom to assemble can be the catalyst to lasting impact.                               Petition                                   If you've been a long-time listener of Glenn, then you will have heard a few of his calls to action where he asks his audience to contact their representatives about a particular piece of policy. There is a good reason Glenn keeps on doing those: they work. Whether it's your local mayor or your senator, a call and an email go a long way. If you really want to make a change, convince your friends and family to reach out as well. The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is to??you guessed it??practice your faith. Become an active member in your place of worship, go to scripture studies, invite your friends to that late afternoon event, and walk the life. This can impact the way you spend money as well.

BECKNews_31," Despite how easy it has been to see the atrocities of the Hamas terrorists, demonstrations have broken out across America and the world IN SUPPORT of Hamas. And some are showing their true colors, like BLM Chicago, which posted a graphic of a Palestinian paraglider in reference to the Hamas paragliders who executed hundreds of civilians at a music festival. They're not just for ""Palestinian liberation,"" Glenn argues. They're cheering on the violent destruction of the Jews in Israel. ""You have one last chance to pick a side,"" Glenn says. And the choice has never been more clear.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: The Golan Heights, is exactly what it sounds like. It is -- it is this mountainous kind of area, that looks down into Israel. If you take control of the Golan Heights, you can kill everybody in that valley.The Israelis took it in 1967, because they knew, what that meant. Because they had seen Syria and others take it, and they saw the damage that could happen in just a few short days.So they took that territory, and said, sorry. Sorry, you're not getting that one back. We don't have an idea yet, of who is doing that. But most likely, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. That is on the South -- or, sorry, the northeast side of Israel. On the northern side of Israel, Hezbollah is lining up on the border.They are also a directly offshoot of Iran.They are lining up. This is a terrible, terrible vicious group.Not that -- not that the rest of them aren't.But this is a very effective group.Then in the South, you have Hamas.And the Palestinian Islamic jihad. Both of them, financed and run by proxy.Through Iran. Then you also have the sleeper cells. That are suspected to be inside of Israel, in Judea and Samaria.That have not been activated yet.By the way, it's important for you to call, quote, the West Bank, by its real name.Judea and Samaria.The West Bank is to -- is used by the Palestinians, to confuse people. You can't have something that is occupied by Jews, if its name is Judea. Stop using West Bank.I know it's hard. Now we have aircraft carrier, going in to help on the western side, with Hamas.But we probably need two aircraft carriers. And we need another fleet, in the straight of Hormuz, and Bab-el-Mandeb. These are the two places, where most of our oil, most of the world's oil, flows through those two straits. And then down, down past the coast of Africa.And the rest of it goes through the Suez Canal.If you have the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb, which is right off of Yemen. Now you know why Iran has been trying to get Yemen for so long.If you control that, you can pretty much control the Suez Canal. You control the Suez Canal. You control most of the world's oil.Let me tell you about something that happened here. I'm trying to put all of this into context. For you.In a way that when I tell you, what I need to tell you today, it will make sense.Cut two here. This is a massive pro-Palestinian rally in Michigan.There has got to be 3,000 people, indoors.Tons and tons of Palestinian supporters, in a rally in Michigan.This is happening all over the world. But it's also happening in all of our big cities.Now, I want you to know, that these -- these -- not necessarily this one. But one in Spain and several around the world, have begun chanting gas the Jews.Gas the Jews.And you can say, well, that's -- you know, that's not everybody.No. It's not everybody.But if I'm standing around somebody that says, gas the Jews. I get away from those people pretty quickly.We have been having a debate about how, you know, Nazi white supremacists are everywhere.I will tell you, I have not seen the Nazi rallies. I have seen one in Charleston. That was enough.I just needed to see that one, to have enough of Nazi rallies. But I see these Palestinian rallies, everywhere. Everywhere.And there is no difference in your support of Palestine today, than your support for the Nazi party in Germany, in 1938.No, I'm sorry. There is a difference. In 1938, we only had speculation. We had Hitler's words. We had words like this. Here's a montage, of Hamas leaders, talking about what their ultimate goal is. In Iran.Cut three, please. He says, oh, Allah. Paralyze the Jews. Destroy them entirely. Oh, Allah, enable us to get to the Jews. Enable us to get to the Jews.The day of your slaughter. Extermination and annihilation is near.Another one, until not a single Jew or Zionist is left on the face of the earth.Our doctrine in fighting you, the Jews is that you will be totally exterminated.You will not leave a single one of you alive.The Koran says, kill them. Wherever you may find them. We will fight them, wherever we can.The moment will come, when property will be destroyed.And their sons, annihilated.Oh, Allah, destroy the Jews. And their supporters.Oh, Allah, destroy the Americans and their supporters. Oh, Allah, count them one by one.Kill them all.Without leaving a single one.(music)This is who they say they are.Now, we had that in the 1920s, and 1930s, with Hitler.We had him saying, what he was going to do.And then, smoke.Then as they were putting together and executing the final solution, they covered it. And tried to let the world know that that's not what they're doing.But this time, we know. This is what they said they were doing.I'm going to play some audio here, and video, that is disturbing.This is from an interrogation from the IDF.Of a Hamas terrorist.That they caught and questioned, listen to this.It's an interrogation. Untouched, unedited.What did you want to do with the Israelis? What did you want to do? Why did you want to have your way with them?Talk. Talk.What did you want to do with those hostages?Dirty them. Dirty them.And why take the kids and the babies?To rape them. Why did you take -- to rape them.Do you understand this? Why did you take the children and the babies?To dirty them. What does that mean?To rape them. Rape them.Give me the reporter on the severed baby's heads.One report. Cut one.VOICE: I'm talking to some of the soldiers. And they say, what they've witnessed, as they've been walking through these different houses, these different communities. Babies, their heads cut off. That's what they said.Gunned down families. Completely gunned down in their beds.GLENN: I don't know. We don't know if that is one baby, 40 babies. That's what's being kicked around now, is that they found 40 babies. One baby is enough.And, quite honestly, you don't have to behead them, to be a monster.You just have to execute them.You just have to walk in, to a -- to a crib, look in it, and shoot them.To me, that makes you a monster.Anyone who is saying right now, that this is at all justified, because of the situation they're in, let me ask you, what kind of civilization, are you building?Because I don't care how bad it got. I would not walk in to house to house to house.And shoot children in their cribs.Let alone, behead one of them.I would be very clear, we're on the wrong side.The first thing I want to tell you today, is the choice is clear.This horrible situation, that happened, over the weekend, is a blessing. To all men on earth.For they have one last chance, to pick a side.You have one last chance.I don't think it's going to become more clear, but what is going to happen from here, is the sides are going to calcify. And now we are overlooking not just chance of shout your abortion. In this death cult.We are now seeing the execution and rape of children and babies.And don't think they're not connected.There is a very clear side. And I'm not saying it's the United States of America.Or Israel.But is there is a very clear side on good.And the good side does not kill and rape children.Clear. Crystal clear.If you make any, any excuse for any of that, you are on the wrong side. If you ignore it, you will be on the wrong side.If you look away, you will be on the wrong side.This is a culling. This is a gathering of people who still understand the difference between right and wrong and good and evil.You have been so manipulated, that most of Americans, they can't tell the difference now!God help them.Number one thing I have to tell you today, this is the time of choosing. This is the time, where you have to make the decision, where do I stand? I have a very important show tonight, on -- on my Wednesday night special at 9:00 p.m.It's all about this. And I urge you to watch it. Call your friends. Your family.The time of choosing is here!Ben Shapiro joins me, as does Dave Rubin.Tonight, at 9:00 p.m. on Blaze TV.Now, Black Lives Matter yesterday, posted a graphic featuring a silhouette of a paraglider and a Palestinian flag, along with the text that says, I stand with Palestine.It has earned more than 14 million views on X, so far. BLM in Chicago also made the graphic its cover photo on Facebook.Now, I have to tell you, all kinds of people said all kinds of things. And were -- were shamed into putting a black box, on their -- on their Facebook page.Or their social pages. In support of BLM. We told you at the time, this is very anti-family. They call in their own words for the end of the nuclear family.It is evil. Now for them, to come out, this week, with a paraglider. The image of these terrorists coming in, they landed, they took their gun. They killed all the people at a concert. And then went into the kibitz. And killed as many as they could. For them to do this, is saying one thing. We do believe in the end of the nuclear family.If it's by raping and killing and beheading children, so be it.If someone did those very things, 200 years ago, they should be condemned.But if you do it to Israelis, you're fine.BLM is an evil organization.And if you cannot bring yourself to say that, you are going to end up on the wrong side.It is an evil organization.Its own charter should have let you know that long ago.They are not about anything. This is what the world looks like, if those kinds of groups win.This is their version of justice.You have a lot of things, to make sure you check off today, so you know which side you're on.   The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy people on the left. The AOC's have taken over, places in the media.And places like this in New York.This is what it is thousand. So there's been one case. One. One in the entire seven years. Where they did this.Where they shut down a company, that had no obvious victims.The case was 1972.And it was a company, relatively small company, that was writing term papers, for college students. Okay.So I want to write my paper.GLENN: I want to break out in God bless America.STU: Capitalism is pretty impressive. Apparently, this didn't go over that well.What they said, there were no obvious victims here. The people bought the term papers. They didn't want to write them. They got the term papers. They said, they were defrauding the education system.GLENN: Which they were.STU: This is the one time. And it's a small tiny company. Let me give you the other times they've done this.Tell me if any of these sound like, hey, I have a good interest rate, on a loan I paid back.Number one, a breast cancer nonprofit was shut down a dozen years ago. For using nearly all its $9 million in donations to pay for director's salaries, perks, and other expenses, instead of funding free mammograms. Okay.So they told everyone, donate money for free. Mammograms. And they just took all the money for themselves.That's number one. Number two, a private equity timber.Faking big investment success, was closed down after stealing millions of dollars from thousands of investors.Okay?You can see.GLENN: Yeah. Got it. But on both of those so far, you have hundreds of thousands of people, you know, I'm sure. That gave -- they're all victims.They gave their money.STU: Yeah. And they didn't get the thing that they want.GLENN: They didn't get the thing they were promised. You have all these people going to the AG. Saying, hey, this is a real problem here. This has to stop. Not here.GLENN: Not here.STU: Another one. Mental health facility, shuttered for looting $4 million from public funds, while neglecting patients.GLENN: Okay. Kind of a big one.STU: Pretty clear. An auto lender that allegedly charged hidden interest rates, got to stay in business last year if it paid a fine and didn't commit fraud in the future.So here's one they didn't shut down.They actually let them go on.They're going after Trump in all of this. In this one, they're like, oh. Sure, they're hidden fees.They're not telling you about them.GLENN: Okay.STU: A judge requested.A judge refused to request to shut down a river rafting company in 2011.After a customer drowned, and the ",-4,,-4
BECKNews_32," The far Left would love nothing more than for America to forget its own history. But it's not just the good that needs preserving. We also must remember our darkest mistakes so we NEVER repeat them. Over the past few years, we've seen the rise of an ""expert class"" of elites who insist THEY know best and the rest of us should shut up and OBEY. But we've seen this before. On this episode of ""Glenn TV,"" Glenn exposes that dark history with the artifacts that prove it. It's all part of the most disturbing section of his traveling museum, ""Blueprints of Liberty ?? The American Journey Experience with Glenn Beck.""Called the ""Red Pill Room,"" it documents real dangers of progressivism and eugenics. Glenn tells the true stories behind disturbing artifacts ?? documents signed by Adolf Hitler and Nazi ""octor"" Josef Mengele that authorized ""mercy"" killings, a briefcase of papers from the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court case, which allowed abortion to thrive, postcards referring to lynchings as ""barbecues,"" and one of the most twisted movies ever made, ""The Black Stork."" These evil ideas, Glenn warns, haven't gone away. They're just called by a new name. But even in all this darkness, there is still hope, as long as we remember what REAL truth is.      The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce.

Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy people on the left. The AOC's have taken over, places in the media.And places like this in New York.This is what it is thousand. So there's been one case. One. One in the entire seven years. Where they did this.Where they shut down a company, that had no obvious victims.The case was 1972.And it was a company, relatively small company, that was writing term papers, for college students. Okay.So I want to write my paper.GLENN: I want to break out in God bless America.STU: Capitalism is pretty impressive. Apparently, this didn't go over that well.What they said, there were no obvious victims here. The people bought the term papers. They didn't want to write them. They got the term papers. They said, they were defrauding the education system.GLENN: Which they were.STU: This is the one time. And it's a small tiny company. Let me give you the other times they've done this.Tell me if any of these sound like, hey, I have a good interest rate, on a loan I paid back.Number one, a breast cancer nonprofit was shut down a dozen years ago. For using nearly all its $9 million in donations to pay for director's salaries, perks, and other expenses, instead of funding free mammograms. Okay.So they told everyone, donate money for free. Mammograms. And they just took all the money for themselves.That's number one. Number two, a private equity timber.Faking big investment success, was closed down after stealing millions of dollars from thousands of investors.Okay?You can see.GLENN: Yeah. Got it. But on both of those so far, you have hundreds of thousands of people, you know, I'm sure. That gave -- they're all victims.They gave their money.STU: Yeah. And they didn't get the thing that they want.GLENN: They didn't get the thing they were promised. You have all these people going to the AG. Saying, hey, this is a real problem here. This has to stop. Not here.GLENN: Not here.STU: Another one. Mental health facility, shuttered for looting $4 million from public funds, while neglecting patients.GLENN: Okay. Kind of a big one.STU: Pretty clear. An auto lender that allegedly charged hidden interest rates, got to stay in business last year if it paid a fine and didn't commit fraud in the future.So here's one they didn't shut down.They actually let them go on.They're going after Trump in all of this. In this one, they're like, oh. Sure, they're hidden fees.They're not telling you about them.GLENN: Okay.STU: A judge requested.A judge refused to request to shut down a river rafting company in 2011.After a customer drowned, and the attorney general showed it was repeatedly using unlicensed guides, or none at all.Instead, he ordered only a 50,000-dollar bond and cleanup -- for him to clean up his act.The company is still being run today, under a different name by the same family. Someone died.GLENN: We have thousands of victims.And in this case, somebody who is dead.STU: Is dead!GLENN: Dead!STU: They're like, you guys can stay open -- and then this one is my favorite one. A judge in 2001.Declined to appoint a receiver, to take over a porn site, despite millions of dollars of illegal credit card charges to hundreds of customers.Who thought they were getting a free tour.Now, look, you're -- you want to get the free -- you want to know what you're subscribing for, Glenn. Before you just pulled the trigger on that. So you put your credit card information into a porn site, I think some of these victims need some life changes to be made here.But they put their credit card into a porn site. Expecting a free tour.They instead, get charged and charged and charged and charged.In fact, once the owners of the site were caught, they attempted to move their money overseas, to avoid any penalty.Still, the judge said, appointing a receiver was an extraordinary remedy!That should be used sparingly, and that a preliminary injunction was good enough.Only after all that happened, it they find out, the people running the porn site, were the Gambino crime family.(laughter)I kid you not. The Gambino crime family.GLENN: And they didn't go into receivership.STU: So there you go. Think about that.I mean, it's so obvious, what they're doing. Latitia james talked about it when she ran.Her goal was to take this one individual out.And the New York -- the voters of New York, said, good.Go do it.And now she's doing it.GLENN: Okay. If you are -- if you have business in in New York, if you're in New York, I'm just telling you. You have to do what you have to do.There's no way, I would keep my business in New York.There is no rule of law now. You know it on the streets. But there is no rule of law. If they can get away with this. They can do anything to you.   Elon Musk has announced that the first Neuralink patient can now control a computer mouse by just thinking. But while this technology could help a lot of people, should we proceed with caution? Between AI and this new merger of man and machine, Glenn gives a warning about what the future could hold. Glenn and Stu also review the controversy surrounding Googles Gemini AI, which refused to generate images of white people.     Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: So the website, Down Detector, detected a surge in outage reports from users at AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Customer Cellular, Boost Mobile, US Cellular, and Straight Talk.That the reports of the system being downed or outages, began at 3:45 a.m. Eastern time. The outages have been reported across many major US cities.It looks like, that it is back up. I'm not sure.They say, they don't think this was a cyber attack.But how did all of them go down at the same time?I mean, that's kind of weird.Yesterday, Israel had a cyber attack.It was from Iran. The Israelis say. And it was an attack on their cell phone services.So quite a coincidence. But let's not jump to any conclusions. Let's see what actually happened.Cyber attacks are going to happen. At some point, soon. We will have cyber attacks. And it will leave you vulnerable, if that's what you depend on.We are becoming more and more, a society that is connected in all things, and absolutely incapable of doing any things, without our electronics.We hit a milestone yesterday. This is truly like landing a man on the moon, I think. This is -- this is the first real merging of man and machine, I think. I mean, we've had the electronic. You know, the bionic arms and things like that.But this is in your mind.It's Neuralink. Elon Musk came up with it. And it is really tempting, because this is -- you know, this will be great to some degree. You'll be able to access information, and have the old internet in your head. You want to speak French?Okay. Download it. Got it.I mean, it is really -- isn't that the Matrix?STU: Yeah. The Matrix too. We're turning into The Matrix. That's the theme of the show today. GLENN: So that is now the beginnings of that, happened and was announced yesterday. Elon Musk said, Neuralink is active in the first person, to have one of the chips implanted in their brain. They have seemingly made a full recovery.We -- you know, so far. We don't know what the effects of this are, or will be. But Musk said, the patient can now move the mouse around a screen, just by thinking.So he has Bluetoothed himself to the screen.Crazy. Huh.STU: It's incredible that they can do that. And, you know, also, look at the way Elon Musk does business.This is a lot of what he does. Which is a lot of kind of just -- let's try it. There's a lot of -- hey, let's give it a whirl.GLENN: He said I think yesterday or earlier this week, that he had plans by 2029, to have a million people on Mars.And when I heard that, I thought, there's no -- oh, it's Elon Musk. Maybe.STU: Well, yeah. And this is his goal, with all of this stuff. He has -- I think it's a T-shirt or something. He wears. Like occupy mars.This is the central idea of his life.GLENN: And this is part of it. Neuralink is part of it.He believes that we are on such a dystopian track right now. That because of global warming, but also because of AI.He believes AI is just as dangerous as global warming. He believes we cannot compete with AI.Unless we can merge with it. Okay.Because it will be operating at such high speeds. We don't have the processing capabilities for the speeds.You know, it's kind of like -- kind of like dogs. Dog life. Seven years. One year for us.It's like one year is a thousand years for AI.So it's moving at such a rapid speed, we won't be able to keep up. So he believes that we need to be able to merge with the machine, until we can get off, this planet.I don't think he'll be taking Neuralink with him. Or maybe he just thinks we won't have access to this AI on Mars.But that's really what is -- is driving him. Driving his whole life.STU: It's really, really hard.Because I know, it feels creepy. And there are risks. And all of that.But it's like, it's really, really hard to think about telling someone, who is paralyzed that, no. We could make you move. But we don't want to pursue that technology.Like, I don't know. I mean, it's just -- it's such incredible technology.And for all of the other stuff, that he's done. Which is really impressive. I mean, Elon Musk is an impressive dude.Space travel. You know, the electric car stuff. I don't care about the electric car stuff that much. But it's still really impressive what he's been able to do.Everyone basically said, you couldn't do it. And no other company could be able to do that. He did that. He's done so many incredible things. But if he was able to take people, you know, with disabilities. And all these -- these issues that have been unsolvable throughout all of human history, and somehow figure out a way to -- through Neuralink or something similar, to solve that for people, it would be the greatest thing he has ever accomplished by a long shot.GLENN: So my daughter Mary had brain surgery, about three, four years ago.STU: Yeah. I remember.GLENN: And it was perfect for a long time.All of her seizures went away. Earlier this year, I think it was in the summer, she started to have breakthrough seizures.And they are even on medication now, they are grand mal. They are --STU: Hmm.GLENN: They're just terrifying. And -- and I said to her, this was about four years ago.I said, honey, if you wait. Elon Musk is doing experience with Neuralink.And one of the things that Neuralink will do. Is it will -- you know, patch all of the brain damage.It will take where -- when you have a stroke, it's like a highway.And there's you all these highways running to different parts of your brain. And if you have a stroke, that highway is cut.So there are other paths to get to where it's going, but it makes it much slower. And sometimes it can't just get to where it's supposed to go.STU: You can't get there from here.GLENN: You can't get there from here.So Neuralink will connect the different parts of the brain, back to each other.And it doesn't need roadway. It's just Bluetooth to all the different parts of the brain, it needs.In effect --STU: Incredible.GLENN: Yeah. Incredible. Absolutely incredible.You know what she said to me.Dad, I think I'll wait.Because I know the savior will heal me, even if it's just in the afterlife.STU: Jeez.GLENN: What a giant.STU: Raised a good kid there, jeez.GLENN: I had nothing to do with it. Nothing to do with it.STU: That's incredible.GLENN: So we have this now. We have what I've been talking about, the singularity, the merging of man and machine. And also, what I've been talking -- I've been talking about this particular category for 30 years, plus. And I said, there's going to come a time, merging man and machine. There's also going to come a time, where you cannot believe your eyes or your ears. We're there now. Did you hear about -- what was her name.Bobbi Althoff. Did you read about this? Bobbi Althoff, apparently, a very sexually",0,,0
BECKNews_33," Do you believe ALL life is sacred? We have learned all too well the consequences of when societies quantify the sanctity of human beings on physical characteristics... or have we? Glenn recently interviewed Scott Schara, who tragically lost his daughter, Grace, with Down syndrome, to alleged medical malpractice. What was the malpractice? After Schara and his wife took Grace to the hospital when her oxygen levels dropped due to contracting COVID, her doctors and nurses gave her a deadly cocktail and a ""do not resuscitate"" order WITHOUT her parents' consent. Schara alleged Grace's doctors didn't deem his daughter's life ""worth saving"" because she had Down syndrome??and allegedly expedited her death.  Glenn recently said, we are becoming a ""ulture of death"" as our society is dangerously edging closer to the mistakes of the past. From New Mexico's law requiring ALL doctors to offer assisted suicide to Canada's expansion of euthanasia laws to include mentally ill and handicapped patients, it is harrowingly clear we are close to repeating the horrors of the 20th century when the sacredness of life was disregarded.  We often point to Nazi Germany as the prime example of a society that devalues life based on physical characteristics. However, we have been too quick to forget the seeds that resulted in the Holocaust were planted here during America's eugenics movement. We laid the egg that Hitler later hatched.  Here is a harrowing timeline of the history of eugenics in America. Many of these eugenics-based laws are STILL in effect to this day.  America's continued history of eugenics demonstrates our culture stands on an ever-thinning razor between good and evil.   This was a popular image promoting eugenics, describing it as the ""self-direction of human evolution."" Famous British scientist and zoologist Francis Galton coined the term ""eugenics"" in 1883. Galton was the cousin of the ""Father of Evolution"" himself, Charles Darwin, and he took inspiration from his cousin's insights into ""natural selection""??if species ""aturally select"" towards those with stronger and fitter traits to weed out the ""weak"" and ""undesirable"" traits, why couldn't humans expedite their own natural selection process? Thus, Galton coined the term ""eugenics""??taken from the Greek, which literally means ""ood genes."" He called for the new practice of humans directing their own natural selection process??their own evolution into a stronger, fitter species. Galton defined eugenics as the practice of giving ??the more suitable races or strains of blood a better chance of prevailing speedily over the less suitable.??  Eugenics emerged alongside ""ial Darwinism,"" the popular 19th-century theory that promoted the similar ideal that society was ruled by ??survival of the fittest.""These two movements morphed into the ""positive eugenics"" that took hold in Britain, which promoted purposeful breeding to ensure the greatest possible genetic outcome for offspring.  Many would assume that such an enterprise emerged from Dr. Mengele out of Auschwitz rather than from one of Britain's most praised scientists. However, the roots of Mengele's practice started in Britain, and would soon be exported to America. The ""Mongol Family"" is an American family that was often put on display as an example of the result of when those with ""negative eugenics"" were allowed to ""breed."" The origin of the term ""Mongol Family"" is unclear.  Smithsonian While ""positive eugenics"" flourished across the pond, ""negative eugenics"" took hold in America. Instead of facilitating the ""breeding"" of the high class, ""negative eugenics"" attempted to ensure that the ""lower"" or ""unfit classes"" weren't able to breed at all.  In 1896, Connecticut became the first state to enact a law to this end, prohibiting epileptics, imbeciles, and the feeble-minded from marrying. Many states followed suit in the first few years of the 20th century, such as Kansas, New Jersey, Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana. This image was taken from a phrenology textbook from the 1960s, a practice used to collect ""eugenics data"" alleging physical differences could distinguish an ""idiot"" from a ""malefactor"" from a ""poet."" As eugenics became a renowned scientific practice, the American Breeders Association established its eugenics branch in 1906??the first official consolidation of organized eugenics research. The eugenics branch was first chaired by ichthyologist and Stanford University president, David Starr Jordan. Indiana became the first state to legalize forced sterilization of criminals, ""eeble-minded,"" or the disabled held in state custody.  Indiana became the first state to pass a forced sterilization law, allowing doctors to castrate or sterilize people in institutions against their will. Due to the rise of social Darwinism, it was believed that criminal behavior and poverty were hereditary traits that could be ""bred out.""  Indiana's law, therefore, made sterilization mandatory for certain individuals with those ""negative traits"" in state custody. The law wasn't permanently repealed until 1974.  Approximately 2,500 total in state custody were sterilized in Indiana.  Dr. Charles Davenport spearheaded the Eugenics Office and served as the head of multiple ""racial hygienic"" boards in Germany, which eventually morphed into the Nazi's Aryan movement. In 1910, the Eugenics Record Office (ERO) was established. As opposed to a single branch of the American Breeding Society, the ERO was dedicated entirely to eugenics research. The ERO was led by the ""father of eugenics,"" Dr. Charles Davenport, and its activities were directly superintended by Harry H. Laughlin, a professor from Kirksville, Missouri, who would become one of the nation's leaders in eugenics-based legislation.  The ERO had multiple ""missions,"" including compiling an index of traits in American families, training field workers to gather data throughout the United States, and providing guidance on the ""eugenic fitness"" for couples considering marriage. Some of America's greatest industrialist titans were the main funders behind the ERO, including the Kellogg family and the Harriman railroad empire. Yes, that's the same Kellogg whose name you probably see on your box of cereal.  The ""Feebleminded Family"" was often displayed at Eugenics meetings and the World Fair to display the effects of ""negative eugenics."" Francis Curtis | The Smithsonian Connecticut passed the first eugenics-based marriage law in 1896. By 1913, more than half of the states have adopted eugenics-based marriage laws, prohibiting ""mixed marriages,"" whether it be of race or socioeconomic class.  Junius Wilson, a deaf man from North Carolina, was falsely accused of attempted rape in the early 1900s.  He was incorrectly judged incompetent and sentenced to indefinite imprisonment. In 1931, Wilson became one of the 70,000 who were castrated under state law.  Everett Parker, Jr. | Smithsonian 1914, Laughlin from the ERO created the ""Model Eugenical Sterilization Law"" which proposed the sterilization of the ??feebleminded?? and those that had physical and mental defects. By this time, 11 states followed suit with Indiana to pass their own sterilization laws. After Laughlin published his ""del Eugenical Sterilization Law"" and proposed it before Congress, 18 more states followed soon after. 33 states in total enacted sterilization laws, leading to 60,000 known forced sterilizations without consent under state/federal custody. California, Virginia, and Michigan led the staunchest sterilization campaigns.  Planned Parenthood's founder Margaret Sanger encouraged birth control to ""[weed] out the unfit."" Bettmann / Contributor | Getty Images Planned Parenthood's founder, Margaret Sanger, was one of the largest proponents of eugenics. She routinely touted birth control and abortion as a means of controlling the reproduction of the ""undesirables"" and facilitating a stronger race through purposeful breeding. She regularly spoke at Ku Klux Klan rallies and other white supremacist groups championing a ""stronger race.""  This quote from Sanger sums it up:  In his book, Mein Kampf, Hitler praised the American eugenics movement, particularly the successful sterilization laws in California. American eugenics continued to influence the Aryan movement in Germany. Davenport, founder of the ERO, was a vocal  supporter of Germany??s racial hygiene and eugenics and was on two editorial boards for the Zeitschrift f??r menschliche Vererbungs- und Konstitutionslehre, which were German racial hygiene journals.  American policies and scientists like Davenport played a massive role in influencing Hitler??s forced sterilizations in Nazi Germany. In the 1930s, the Nazi Party requested help from Californ""ugenicists on how to run their own sterilization program. Christina Cogdell, a cultural historian at the University of California-Davis, said: Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. supported the majority opinion in favor of state sterilization laws in Buck v Bell. Bettmann / Contributor | Getty Images The Supreme Court upheld state-level sterilization laws in the landmark case, Buck v Bell. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. claimed:  Margaret Sanger spoke to the women??s auxiliary of the Ku Klux Klan at a rally in New Jersey in support of the Supreme Court??s decision. By the 1970s more than 60,000 individuals had been forcibly sterilized under thirty-three state laws, protected by the Supreme Court.  These ""odly heritage"" medals were given to family members in the ""fitter families contests"" held by the American Eugenics Society in venues like the World Fair in Chicago.  Smithsonian The 1933-34 World Fair in Chicago featured a eugenics exhibit titled ??Pedigree-Study in Man?? in coordination with the fair??s ??Century of Progress?? theme. Stations were organized to demonstrate how ""able traits"" in the human population could best be passed down. In addition to the World Fair, the ERO sponsored ??fitter families?? contests at state and county fairs, awarding medals to ""genically sound"" families.  Presentations contrasting the Roosevelt family and a ""degenerate"" family were displayed. Fairgoers were urged to adopt the progressive view that a responsible citizen should pursue marriage mindfully based on eugenics principles to promote a genetically stronger generation. 31 states and the District of Columbia still retain the forced sterilization laws pushed by Laughlin and other eugenicists in the 20th century. Though the Dobbs decision overturned Roe v Wade,  Margaret Sanger's legacy still lives on in the thousands of abortions that are still carried out every day. ELEVEN states have active state-assisted suicide laws, which is a glossier term for ""euthanasia."" How many other cases have there been, like Grace Schara, whose lives weren't deemed living because of their genetic condition? It is ironic, to say the least, that eugenics emerged during America's ""Progressive Age,"" where leaders and scientists trampled over basic human dignity for the sake of ""progress."" Are we headed toward a similar fate in our current century? If you ask the Schara family, we are already there.      WRITER  Texas is under threat of a George Soros-backed takeover. Soros-funded RINO judges have been elected in some of the highest courts in Texas. These judges implemented restrictions that have blocked nearly a thousand cases of voter fraud from being investigated or prosecuted from across the state. These new restrictions are similar to ones in place in states like George, Arizona, and Wisconsin, leaving Texas more susceptible to election corruption than ever. If Texas falls to corruption, America will lose its largest bastion of conservative electoral power in the nation. Without Texas, Republicans WILL NOT be able to win national elections and liberal corruption will go unchecked across the country.  Fortunately, there is a way to stop this: YOU. If you live in Texas you have a chance to stand up against corruption and to fight back! Starting Tuesday, February 20th, early voting for the primaries begins, where three of these judges are up for election. Go out and vote. If the right people are voted in, there's a good chance the restrictions will be lifted and election fraud can once again be prosecuted.  But remember, you can't just go in and vote for anyone who has an ""R"" next to their name. Sorors knows that a registered Democrat would never stand a chance in Texas, so his lackeys register as Republicans and ride the little ""R"" right into office. So who do you vote for?  Fortunately, Glenn had Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on his show today and Ken gave us his list of judges that he vouches for. His list is as follows:    WRITER  Who is really banning books? For years now, Conservatives have been taking flak from the left for supposed ""book bans."" The left likes to compare these ""bans"" to Nazi book burnings, accusing the right of sweeping authoritarian decrees designed to suppress information. In reality, this is a movement largely motivated by parents, who want to remove inappropriate books from children's libraries.  But if you want to discuss authoritarian book bans, look no further than the White House. As Glenn recently covered, the Biden administration has been pressuring the world's largest bookseller, Amazon, into suppressing books they disagree with. On February 5th, 2024, Ohio Representative Jim Jordan released a slew of subpoenaed documents that exposed pressure placed on Amazon by the Biden Administration. The documents, which Jordan dubbed ""The Amazon Files"" after Elon Musk's ""The Twitter Files,"" revealed an email conversation between Andrew Slavitt, a former White House senior adviser, and Amazon employees. In these emails, Slavitt complained that the top search results for books on ""vaccines"" were ""concerning"" and then requested that Amazon intervene. Amazon initially refused, not out of some altruistic concern for the free exchange of information. They thought any action taken would be ""too visible"" and would further exasperate the ??Harry/Sally narrative,?? referring to the outrage that followed Amazon's removal of Ryan T. Anderson??s book When Harry Became Sally.  Despite this initial refusal, Amazon agreed to meet with the White House a few days later. The number one item on their agenda was""oving books from the website. An Amazon employee even admitted that the reason they even took this meeting was due to the pressure being placed on them by the Biden Administration.  What was the result of this meeting? Amazon caved. They began to implement ways of limiting the outreach of books that challenged the mainstream vaccine narrative and other books the White House might not like. The White House was caught red-handed pressuring the world's largest bookseller to restrict the sale of books they consider in opposition to their narrative, and they have the gall to accuse conservatives of information suppression. This is just ONE of many actions committed by the Biden Administration that are more characteristic of a dictator than a president. What can you do about it? Fortunately, you are not dependent on Amazon and its corrupted algorithm to help you find books. Every week right here on GlennBeck.com, we highlight books that Glenn is reading or talking about in our ""Glenn's Bookshelf"" series. Here you can find a wide selection of books free from Amazon's filters. Be sure to sign up for Glenn's newsletter to find out about new additions to ""Glenn's Bookshelf"" every week.    WRITER   The left-wing media's most recent tirade is accusing Trump of being a dictator. But, as Glenn said, ""Everything they're accusing us of, they're doing."" Since day one, the Biden administration has overstepped the bounds placed on the executive branch set by the Constitution. In Glenn's most recent TV Special, he examined ten times Biden acted like a dictator, NOT a president. Here are 10 of Biden's Dictator Moves, and click HERE to get ALL of the research that went into this week's Glenn TV special:     WRITER   Every day it seems Glenn covers another story revealing how people across the world at all levels of power DESPISE the fact that YOU have rights, and they are actively trying to curtail them. Recently, there has been a string of attacks against the rights outlined in the First Amendment: the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, the freedom of assembly, and the freedom to petition. As a refresher, the First Amendment reads as follows: This is powerful stuff, there is a good reason the Founding Fathers made it the FIRST Amendment. It's also the reason why power-hungry elites are attacking it. These attacks are designed to control the way you think, speak, and believe, vote, what you read, and who holds your representatives responsible. The First Amendment is our strongest weapon against tyrants, and they know it. So what can you do about it? Hope that some wig in Washinton will eventually do something? We know how well that works. The best thing to do is to stay active, engage in the issues you care about, and exercise your rights.  So where to start? Here are a few things YOU can do to protect your First Amendment rights:                                Religion                                   The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is toyou guessed itpractice your faith. Become an active member in your place of worship, go to scripture studies, invite your friends to that late afternoon event, and walk the life. This can impact the way you spend money as well. Shop the businesses and brands that share your values, and don't shop at the ones that scorn them. Keeping the community alive and healthy is the best way to ensure that generations to come will be able to experience the freedom you enjoy.                              Speech                                   Much like religion, the best way to protect your freedom of speech is... to speak. Engage your friends and family in polite, civil conversation. Stand up for what you believe in, and make your case to your peers. Just remember to keep it friendly. No one ever won an argument by shouting down their opponent. The civil exchange of ideas is the cornerstone of our republic, and a dialogue where the participants are well-informed, considerate, compassionate, and open-minded can have permanent impacts on all involved.                              Press                                   Freedom of the Press seems a little tricky at first. Unless you work for the media, what are you supposed to do? Quit your job and go work for the local newspaper? The good news is that exercising this right is not nearly that difficult. In fact, you are currently doing it. The best thing you can do is to read from outlets that produce informative content. Want to know what Glenn consumes to stay informed every day?

Assembly                                    Anna Moneymaker / Staff | Getty ImagesFreedom of assembly is one of the more impactful yet underutilized freedoms in the First Amendment. Peaceably assembling and protesting with like-minded individuals can hugely influence politicians and policies while simultaneously creating community and fellowship between attendees. It's understandable why more people don't turn out. We're all busy people with busy schedules, and flying out to D.C. for the weekend seems like a daunting task to many. Thankfully, you don't have to go out all the way to D.C. to make a difference. Gather some like-minded people in your town and bring awareness to issues that impact your community. Big change starts locally, and exercising your freedom to assemble can be the catalyst to lasting impact.                               Petition                                   If you've been a long-time listener of Glenn, then you will have heard a few of his calls to action where he asks his audience to contact their representatives about a particular piece of policy. There is a good reason Glenn keeps on doing those: they work. Whether it's your local mayor or your senator, a call and an email go a long way. If you really want to make a change, convince your friends and family to reach out as well. The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is to??you guessed it??practice your faith. Become an active member in your place of worship, go to scripture studies, invite your friends to that late afternoon event, and walk the life. This can impact the way you spend money as well. Shop the businesses and brands that share your values, and don't shop at the ones that scorn them. Keeping the community alive and healthy is the best way to ensure that generations to come will be able to experience the freedom you enjoy.

BECKNews_34," Global elites and the media are hard at work to convince you that everything they are planning is a ""conspiracy theory."" But Glenn argues that they're really ""conspiracy FACTS."" Glenn reads an article titled ""11 assumptions about the future"" from Doug Casey's International Man that can be used to guide our actions moving forward, and it lines up with the warnings Glenn gave in his newest book, ""Dark Future."" Glenn reviews these 11 plans global elites have for your future: CBDCs, digital IDs, a ""Greater Depression,"" a rise in crime and censorship, and even World War III are either already here or likely around the corner. So, here's how you should prepare ...    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I'm -- I'm -- I'm wondering, if I should share something with you, that I found very, very true.Eleven assumptions about the future. And it's from Doug Casey. And, I mean, I don't want to bum you out, it's a Monday.But I included it on today's show prep at GlennBeck.com.Because I think it's really important. Because I think it is true.And this -- the reason why I say these things.Because there's a lot of people who listen to this program. And you're like, I know. I know. It's coming, right?I know.Yeah. If you ever hear me say, I'm going to the mountain, and I probably won't be back. Then you know. But it's coming.And here's what's coming.Change. That's it. Change.Everything in life changes. We're under constant change. The America that was 100 years ago, has changed so many times, the people I think if we had a time machine. People from 100 years ago, would come here, and they would say, oh.I don't want to live there. And we would go back to their time and go, I really don't want to live back there. We're all born for a specific time.And now is our time. And change is coming.Now, this is -- I would classify it as catastrophic change, not because it's all bad.It could be really, really great. We're not headed towards the great basket right now.We're headed towards the other basket. Catastrophic basket. Basket.And that's a choice, that we all have to make.But the biggest problem with this is, the politicos have done such a good job in dividing all of us. And I would put myself in this category too. I've had my share of dividing people.And it has been --STU: You? You've --GLENN: Hmm?STU: You -- you think you're decisive in some way? I've never heard such a claim.GLENN: Well, not intentionally. In today's world. Just telling the truth.STU: That's plenty.GLENN: Just telling the truth is enough.And we have to get past that.Because when I'm looking at these things.I think, if people could just wake up, we could fix this.Now, Doug Casey has Doug Casey's take on podcasts. That I want you to listen to what he says, is coming.Here are the 11 assumptions that I'm using today, to guide my actions.One, less freedom of movement is coming.There will be more effort, is to restrict and regulate our freedom of movement from vax passports, to increased visa requirements. And 15-minute city initiatives.The grid is being constructed to regulate our freedom of movement. That is absolutely true.And if you read Dark Future, you'll know it to be true because we outline it.These are not conspiracy theories.These are facts, that are also conspiracies.Conspiracy just means, there are people plotting and trying to cover their tracks.And trying to deny, to throw people off their trail.Well, they're not even denying.They're just using the media to say, conspiracy theory!And then they do it anyway.For instance, the gas stoves.Do you know that every single appliance, and you can read about it in today's show prep. At GlennBeck.com.Get my show prep. Because I can only get to maybe I don't even know.10 percent of the stories. Get my show prep every day.It's so critical, that you read that. It's free at GlennBeck.com.But these are things that every time, they say, it's a conspiracy theory. They throw you off the trail.They divide us even further.And then what happens?They just do it, because it's too late.Second, CBDC is coming.Cash will be eliminated. How restrictive it may end up being, I don't know.But CBDC, is a foregone conclusion.Timing, some say, by 2030, there are indications that major economies are working to be ready to deploy by 2025.The digital ID is already here.It's number three.Biometrics are the future. If you have a government issued ID, associated with your photograph. You're in the system already.How the ID is developed and deployed. And enforced is the question.Number four. The greater depression. Timing is hard. But can any thinking person imagine how the outcome can be avoided altogether.Suggest, a market pullback of up to 30 percent between now and early 2024.Okay. This I've heard from several people, 30 percent pullback. That's the stock market falling 30 percent.And everyone I've talked to. And I don't know about stock markets. And I -- I hate the stock market.But everybody I talked to said, about 30 percent or more is coming. And we might already be in it.It will be followed by a pump, and deflationary wipeout in 2025.Most financial assets, number five, will disappear at some point.Inflation, bank bail-in. Market wipeout.I don't know the cause. But I assume -- I assume physical assets are where I need to be ultimately.This is important for you to understand.That land, your home, anything physical, any gold, silver, food, seeds. Anything physical, is important.Anything that is money, it will -- you can bury it all you want. It will slip through your fingers.Because that's all going to be taken. Debt is going to be a real problem. When the banks start to collapse, they'll just start seizing assets.Six, increasing crime and disorder. You've seen the videos. Whether driven by economic desperation, mass migration. The inversion of law. Or in the name of social justice.Crime and disorder will grow and lead to greater physical threats to our lives and property from our fellow man. This makes urban environments, especially but not exclusively a real risk, absolutely true.How many times do I tell you, a week, Stu.You really don't want to be near the city. You really --STU: You do mention it to me, a lot.GLENN: A lot.You don't want to be near the cities. Number seven.Supply constraints are increasing around all commodities.From food, to energy.Did you see the story in the show prep today, Stu. About what he's done. What Biden has just done with oil and gas.He's passed the toughest standards on drilling and finding natural gas, in the history of America.He is shutting it down from food to energy. Tight supplies are showing up everywhere.Live cattle, long dormant, hit an all-time high recently. Oil prices are up 30 percent in the last three months.Forty percent of Argentina's wheat crop is in poor to fair condition, and protectionist policies are on the rise globally.Eight, World War III is coming.A good case can be made. That it's already begun.I don't know if you saw this, this is also in the show prep today.The Army War College recently published a study suggesting that the all-volunteer force had reached the end of its useful life. With the military struggling with recruiting, conscription is likely at some point.I don't know if you saw this, also in the show prep.Russia is holding for the first time ever.Let me see if I can find this.Russia is set to hold a nationwide exercise, early next month.According to new reports.In preparation, for the danger of armed conflicts, involving nuclear weapons.Russia authorities will hold a large-scale trillion across the country, on October 3rd. Is that tomorrow, or is that today?That's tomorrow. Because of the growing danger of armed conflicts, including with nuclear capable powers, near Russia's borders. The drill is the first time, that Moscow has held such a drill.Which will imagine that Russia is at least partially under marshal law. And that up to 70 percent of the country's housing facilities, have been destroyed.That's what they're preparing for.Now, we're saying, well, I don't -- what are we -- are we?Yeah. We should go to war. Because my party says, we should go to war.You have noticed, by the way. That that is something that the parties are saying. But the American people are not?If you look at the latest poll numbers. It is showing, that the American people are not in step with the parties.It's the parties that are pushing for war. The average American is saying, I don't want to go to war. I've no desire to go to war. I don't think we should even be there.STU: I mean, the parties are not outwardly saying that. But their actions are taking us down that road.GLENN: Definitely.STU: And the American people are now getting to the point to where they're opposing even the funding of the war effort in Ukraine. Republicans are already there. Independents are getting closer. Democrats still, very low level of opposition to it. But rising.GLENN: And look at this, conscription is likely, at some point. That means, if they missed your child in school, they'll indoctrinate them in the military.I mean, the military, even with everything that's coming up, the military is still saying, no. Abortion and DEI, much more important than -- you know, that's going to kill us. I'll tell you that. This stopping those programs.STU: That's the kind of thing an election can solve. Right?Having a Republican president that makes some sense, could put an end to that quickly.GLENN: A change in our policies, less freedom of movement. Number one.Goes away. CBDC. You already have DeSantis saying, day one. No CBDC.The digital ID. That could be stopped with an election. The greater depression.Maybe not. If we don't turn this around quickly.Financial assets will disappear at some point.Maybe -- maybe not.Increasing crime and disorder. That could be changed. Supply restraints. Increasing around all commodities. Oil. That can change. Food? That can change.World War III is coming. That can change. Censorship, and digital control, will enter a new phase.Deplatforming. Debanking. Shadow banning. And social media account suspensions will increase.Centralized digital services of all kind should be considered suspect.And very likely dangerous to use. In the future.Wow. By the way, I can't believe I'm saying this, but in today's newsletter. There's a story about Canada. Trudeau is now pushing to regulate all podcasts.They have tight regulation for all broadcasts. There are things that you just can't and cannot do in Canada.You notice, they don't have talk radio in Canada. Not like this.It's not popular. Any time, they tried this, you would have to balance this. So it's all Milquetoast, awful.And it's tightly regulated. To the point to where the Blaze, which is here in America, our sister. I mean, we're not actually sisters. But our sister, news outlet out there is Rebel News. And they have had trouble with the government over and over and over again.And they won't shut up.And they're not radical.They just believe in freedom of speech.Number ten, the US election. Regardless of the outcome, is an inflection point, and potentially a flash point.GLENN: So number ten on this list, is the US election, regardless of the outcome, is an inflection point. And potentially a flash point.If, the writer writes, if that happens, the outcome will not be accepted by half of the country.We can be sure, that running up to and shortly after the election, things could get wild.In advance of the 2020 election, we had COVID and BLM. Shortly after, January 6th and state overreach.What will 2024 bring?I think this is something that we need to begin to talk about. Because I think everybody knows it. We just don't talk about it.I think everybody fears that if Donald Trump or whoever is the G.O.P. candidate, wins, the left will scream, that it was stolen.And they'll be in the streets, for every cut. And everything that happens.STU: Sure. Any doubt about that?GLENN: None. None. STU: I mean, the last two elections have been this scenario, where half of the country says, it's a fake. Last two. And I don't see -- there's any possibility of this one. Unless you had some Reagan-esque landslide. Maybe. Maybe you have a chance.GLENN: Maybe. Maybe. If Donald Trump doesn't win, does anyone believe that there aren't a lot of people that -- and I would seriously question the election. Even -- I don't care who wins.I haven't seen anyone do anything of significance, in the states that are the swing states.All of the states that Donald Trump lost last time, because they stopped -- they stopped counting.Okay.I don't know what that was.I haven't seen anybody actually really look into it. With any credibility.So I don't feel confident.Now, those states, they have either enhanced those laws. Or strengthened those laws. To give us the same kind of election, we had last time.STU: Some -- you could argue with some of those states. I think, for example, Georgia has improved their laws. There have been some that have done it.Again, here's the thing, Glenn. I don't think anyone actually is looking -- going to be looking at. Well, let me -- bring the evidence to me. Place it in front of me.Let's have a real discussion of what happened.People just feel. They feel it. And it doesn't matter if it's honestly issued or not.The problem with the system is that everyone feels like we're in this state of constant chaos.And nothing is real.GLENN: Correct. Correct.STU: And I guarantee you, if Donald Trump wins the election. The other side will claim fraud. And if Joe Biden wins, then the Republican side will claim fraud.It will just happen. It's just part of our landscape right now.GLENN: And then final point from Doug Casey's 11. There's a war happening today. It's a war on us. For most of this cycle, they will rely on the same approach, if and when we see a move toward a kinetic force.We should be alarmed. Because we've entered a new phase. And a more dangerous phase.It's out of your control. But your life is not. Fix your life.Get that at GlennBeck.com. We'll send you the link to today's show prep.   The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of peo",-6,,-6
BECKNews_35," The House of Representatives has ousted Rep. Kevin McCarthy as speaker. But was this move ?? supported by only 8 Republicans and every Democrat ?? a smart one? BlazeTV host Mark Levin holds nothing back as he joins Glenn to give his thoughts: ""is is one of the dumbest ass wars I have ever seen."" Levin explains his biggest disagreement with Rep. Matt Gaetz, who spearheaded the ousting: ""If you're gonna blow up the House, blow it up for the right reason."" And he urges Republicans who are happy about the ousting to remember one thing moving forward (which also happens to be the title of his newest book): ""The Democrat Party HATES America.""    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: My friend Mark Levin. How are you, sir?MARK: I'm great. Thank you.GLENN: What is your take on what happened yesterday in the House?MARK: Well, I've been very outspoken about this, and a lot of people want to get behind Matt Gaetz. I'm not one of them. So I guess I'm a neocon RINO sellout.GLENN: Don't you hate this? Don't you hate this?MARK: I will put it on my business card. Look, you and I spent decades fighting these wars. This is one of the dumbest ass wars I've ever seen. Why? You've got guys who claim to be conservative. One of them Nancy Mace, votes against McCarthy because he wouldn't put an abortion bill on the floor. He wouldn't put a gun control bill on the floor.She's a complete head case. You have another guy, Andy Biggs, president of the state Senate in Arizona, who blocked Convention of States. He runs for Congress, he wins. He wants to replace us. And then Arizona becomes one of 20 states passing a resolution for Convention of States. That's where my head is. Convention of States. Then you have another guy. This guy from Tennessee. That nobody ever heard of before. Why is he mad?Because he said, McCarthy criticized the coalition when he spoke of something. I'm like, I'm not a special pleader for McCarthy. And I'm not a special pleader for Gaetz. I call them as I see them.And so he says what he says. You know why he voted for McCarthy?Because he chaired a subcommittee. And he said, he worked really hard on this UFO issue. And he wanted to chair this committee on the UFOs. And Comber told him, he's not going to lie to him.And he got very angry. That's why he votes against McCarthy. Then we have Gaetz, who goes to the floor of the House. And I'm listening them very, very carefully. This is very important.And he says, we didn't have regular order. He promised us 12 bills.I had Thomas Massie on the show, who is a long-time Libertarian conservative. He's the best of the best.GLENN: I love him.MARK: He said, that's not what happened. You have to get these bills out of committee.The Democrats were laddering up these things.It was the conservatives who killed them in committee.We couldn't get these bills to the floor. It has nothing to do with violating a promise or anything else.And he said my show, you can't have it both ways. Regular order. Or whatever comes out of the committee, goes to the floor. And at the same time, we need to cut the budget.He said, the Democrats were playing us.And others. Voted against the committee, so it couldn't get to the floor.So listening to him, and I said, well, then, what's this?12 bill stuff that Gaetz -- he says, Gaetz knows this.I said, okay. Then I listed myself. Gaetz say, we have a 33 trillion-dollar debt.And I said, on the air, I don't remember Gaetz speaking up against all this COVID spending.Massey, he never did. Not once.I said, well, that was $3 trillion, right there. They wanted to spend $6 trillion.Almost none of it went to, quote, unquote, COVID. Or the pandemic.I'm telling you, that if you're going to blow up the House. Blow it up for the right reasons.I worked for the administration. We shut the government down eight times. Exactly why we shut it down.He wanted an MX missile system. He wouldn't give them to them. He wanted weapons in Europe. To defeat the Soviets. Which is what happened.And he shouted at it, until he got it.Very specific. This is -- we have a 33 trillion-dollar debt to debt. Let's burn down Washington.Okay. Great. So what are they going to do in you?GLENN: That was my question.MARK: The budget now. They can't control it.GLENN: I would love to -- you know, I'm not a fan of McCarthy. However, what is your plan now? You don't run away from something. You run towards something.They weren't running toward anything. Who were they running to? Who was going to take it?MARK: They ran towards the squad and Hakeem Jeffries. Behind the scenes, they were working with them, while complaining that McCarthy is working with -- I don't want any of them working with them, for anything.Fifteen percent of the Democrats in the House are Marxists. They're outspoken, quote, unquote, democratic socialists.Why the hell are you working with these progressive caucuses. And going to whatever, Jamala, whatever. Trying to coordinate with her. Why are you going to AOC, like you have a real love lust for the woman?It's constant. And then you're raising money on it? And that's right -- sending -- putting together lists to run for governor.Well, at least I'm not paid for by the special -- hey, bro.You know the 20-point Republican preference. You are referencing the Republican panhandle of Florida. And those are wonderful patriots.They're never going to vote for Democrats. Then you have this guy from Montana, who ran for the Senate, and lost last time. And wants to run again.And he says, he prayed for a very small Republican majority in the House. So he and the others would have -- wow, that's unconstitutional. So he runs the House of Representatives with the Democrats?Let me tell you something. He made sure he won his election. But he didn't want enough people to come in, or we had a big majority.You know, there's a lot of patriotic people, that lost in that midterm election. That many of us voted for.Like here in northern Virginia.He lost by 1 percent. In a purple, or actually more blue district.Loughton County, Virginia, for God's sake. Am I glad he lost?So Rosendale has more power?This guy is from Montana. He has nothing to do with me.And so you've got -- there's so many weird things going on.And people need to scratch their heads and ask this.Is Chip Roy a RINO? Is Byron Donalds a RINO? Is Jim Jordan? Is every other member of the Freedom Caucus, who voted against these guys, are they RINOs too?No. There's a difference between anarchy and constitutional conservatism. Read your Constitution, folks.There's no anarchy in there. There's no mobocracy. They oppose the mobocracy.They oppose the central government. You know this.They set up a complex government system.Our only hope is the House of Representatives. With a tiny majority.That Senate Republicans have sold us out.Here's the bottom line. That man is still as they proposed. It was negotiated by Chip Roy and Byron Donalds.With Ted Cruz and other conservative Republicans in the Senate. The plan was that this would pass.The greatest cut in a short-term CR, probably in American history. Certainly in our lifetime.30 percent protecting the Defense Department. The Border Patrol. And veterans.That was it. So that would affect the FBI. It would affect the Department of Justice.It would affect all this stuff.And it was negotiated by the conservatives. Got it to the Senate.So we have some leverage over Mitch McConnell.Who is a real SOB. That guy.Every time. Five of them chosen. They said, in. Shut the government down. They said, shut it down.This is better. We won't know what we will get if we shut it down.Do this. We have the support. We have negotiated with the RINOs and everything else.Let's do it. And they kill it.That's why I've had it with these people. And people shouldn't just follow them.They're doing nothing. Zero.And I'll tell you one other thing. I would not negotiate with Hakeem Jeffries, and these democratic Marxists in the squad, and all the rest of them.If you put a gun to my head. These people are destroying my country, at every turn.They are the enemy.Not adversaries. They are the enemy. And you're cutting deals with them.And then you're sending, you're the true believer. You're cutting deals with the democratic majority?And now we're going to have a bigger, bloated budget?The border will remain open, because part of that bill they opposed, had the strictest restrictions on the border, ever cashed by the House of Representatives.I read it, it's unbelievable. Would it pass the Senate?Well, I don't control the Senate.Well, it would give us something to negotiate with.Look at the house. Look at what they passed, Mr. McConnell. We have to do something about this. Now they have nothing.Zero.And so I would ask people who are defending and promoting these people.Do you know who they are?How do you know the guy from Tennessee?How many of you know a guy from Montana?How many of you really know about Nancy when is a complete head case, out of South Carolina?So this is my problem. That we have had good momentum going in.Forget about personalities.McCarthy. I don't care. We had good momentum going in.And now we're stuck.Everything -- everything is frozen.Everything.GLENN: And --MARK: And we're packing the most conservative body we have. It's not conservative enough. The presidency is gone. The Senate is gone. The courts are gone. We have a five-vote majority in the House. We're doing more with that five-vote majority than anybody.And we just crippled it. That's my take, Glenn.GLENN: You know, the one thing I love about having a talk show host on.Is I asked a question about 11 minutes ago.And it was a great answer. I know. I didn't want to.It was a great answer.All right. I want to talk to you about -- all right. I don't think there's anything more plain.The Democratic Party hates America.So before we get to the book. How much time do you have, first of all, can I keep you until about a quarter until?MARK: Actually, yes. I have a lifetime, my brother. How are you?GLENN: I mean, this is the opposite end of the clock for you too. I mean, you're getting up, and you're this fired up. I love it.So, Mark, first, let me ask you, do you see a plan? Is there a plan? Is there something that we're hoping for at this point?MARK: No. I would love to see one. I mean, when the case is asked, who would he accept? He starts with naming liberal members of the House.I thought, holy crap.I don't know what the plan is. I don't even know who would want to be speaker at this point.Forget about McCarthy and so forth.Thinking, okay.And the way that works is, from the propaganda point of view. These guys will claim victory, no matter what happens.So, in other words, let's say they actually -- let's say a Jim Jordan. Who I love.GLENN: Yes. And they will say, you wouldn't have Jim Jordan.They have it all planned out.And the fact of the matter is, one of the biggest supporters of the previous speaker was Jim Jordan.And he even gave a speech on the floor.Why? He said, because he let us do what we needed to do.He never interfered.He said, whatever you need, I'll take care of it. So forth. So on.The Rules Committee. There were more conservatives on the Rules Committee in the history of the House of Representatives. Then they had Tom Massey on there, Byron Donalds on there, and another conservative.Chip Roy, who had the power to block anything, and to promote anything.And so he said, he's been in the House for a while now.He said, he came in at the same time, McCarthy did.And he said, it's never been more open.And he said, it's on open. That everybody in agreement, was thinking about running against him.So that's how you get the Nancy Maces in there, and these other people in there.And that's why, and then Chip Roy -- sometimes we have to accept victory. Well, we have a 30 percent cut, in the ordered security bill, which is the strongest kind of -- that the House has ever passed.This is -- this is a 30-day bill.Why the hell wouldn't we just pass it?I said, it beats me.That's why I'm not a politician. I couldn't figure you guys out, to be perfectly honest with you.So --GLENN: You know, you said, Mark, that the democratic party.I think you said, 60 percent are named Marxists. They are fine with being democratic Marxists or socialists.MARK: That's correct.GLENN: How did this happen?MARK: Well, here's the truth: The fact is, that's the point of the book. You're very good. It's a very good segue there.GLENN: Thank you.MARK: I just wanted to say, everything I know I learned from Glenn.GLENN: Yeah, right.MARK: You are. You are top shelf, baby.Look, here's the bottom line with this book. The book explains that the Democrat Party has never accepted America's founding. It has never accepted its principles. We wouldn't have had a civil war, if it wasn't for the Democratic Party. The vast majority of Americans, I don't even know if owned slaves. Ever met slaves. Even in the South, a tiny percentage, tiny. Think about -- don't get me wrong. But not the vast majority of the people in the south. There were two quarters that owned slaves. Slavery was an abomination.And who perpetuated it? The Democratic Party. Who was prepared to destroy the country to defend it?The Democrat Party. The party who considers it.Look, we don't have enough time.The book is 400 pages.I will tell you this, I decided to take all their icons. FDR.GLENN: Good for you.MARK: The Kennedy family. Lyndon Johnson.People wouldn't have learned things about these people, they couldn't have possibly known. Because the Democratic Party writes our history -- or I should say, rewrites our history.So all the things, the Democrat Party today condenses. And we condense.Back in our history, it's their history.I mean, they did this to the country.   The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New Yor",-7,,-8
BECKNews_36," Glenn shares a mental exercise  but a real dilemma faced by our Founding Fathers centuries ago: Is compromising on moral issues worth it to avoid Civil War? Would YOU support a compromise with the far-left on something like abortion, if it saved our Bill of Rights and our Republic?     Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors STU: So we're talking about how to heal the wounds of the country, I guess. And how to keep it together. And, Glenn, you brought up a deal. Can you go through this deal one more time? I'm not sure how I feel about it.GLENN: Yeah. This is a mental exercise. That's all this is. This couldn't happen. And I honestly don't know if I would be for the deal. I'm just proposing. If we have civil war. Right now, we disagree on so much.At least in politics. But I do believe that the American people, still have more in common than we have apart. There are politicians and -- and very well-monied entities that are doing everything they can, to tear us apart. But if I could wave a magic wand, and I could say, all right. Let's compromise. I know you have problems with speech. I know you have problems with the Second Amendment. I know you have problems with all these things.You just give us that, and we'll give you abortion with a caveat.You -- no taxpayer dollars are going for it.And you can't build another abortion clinic. So whatever you've got going on, you -- you have.Now, this would begin in ten years. Let's say. And I'm basing this off the model of compromise. With the founders and slavery.Slavery to our founders was absolutely immoral. Immoral.But they had two states that just would not go along with it. So what are you going to do?So they made a compromise. We'll put a cap on it. You can't import anymore slaves in ten years.And that was, it's going to -- we're going to cap it. No more importation. We're going to do our best to stop it. In hopes that they would change people's hearts against slavery. And avoid a civil war.So I'm asking you, the most immoral thing that I think we do is abortion. So that would be the biggest compromise for me. And I'm not sure I would make it. But if it meant no civil war, and we would come back to e pluribus unum, on the Bill of Rights, but we had to sacrifice and abortion could happen in all 50 states. But there was a cap to it.Would you do it?STU: In all 50 states now? Or are you just saying now where it kind of is?VOICE: Yeah. You have to kind of compromise. And it would be all 50 states. You get the Bill of Rights. But all 50 states have abortion, but they cannot expand it. I know, it's horrible.It's like saying to people who are abolitionists. We're just going to cap it. And we're going to try to stop the slave trade. And let's all work to change people's hearts. More Civil War.STU: Yeah. It's interesting. Because conceptually, what you're saying here, is the country itself worth tolerating some amount of what you see as evil.And obviously, we do have lots of things in our country, that are disagreeable. But something like this, which is I think fundamentally --GLENN: Is evil.STU: Yeah. I think that's how it will be looked on eventually. That you wipe out 65 million people.GLENN: I do too.STU: Over 50 years. Sounds pretty bad.So is it worth tolerating that? I guess at some level, we all do that, right?We're not arguing for Civil War. And we have abortion in many, many states. All the states up until a few weeks ago. So at some level, we have agreed to some version of this, without getting the benefits of people actually respecting the Bill of Rights. So I do think the country, fundamentally, if you look at the overall good, we've done as a nation, it is worth, you know, tolerating a lot.I mean, we've done it. We've been doing it for a long time.GLENN: So isn't that we what hear from every senator and congressman that has ever gone bad. Their point of no return is, yes. I have to compromise on this evil thing.But if -- if I don't stay in, or if I do compromise on this, I can be a head of a committee. And then it's just over for them.Isn't this the fruit, the poison fruit, that our Founders tried the first time?How -- what would be said about us, in 150 years, assuming abortion is looked at, as mass murder, like we think it is. What would be said about us? Really? How did they even think they believed all men are created equal, life, liberty, and the pursuit -- how could they believe any of that? Such hypocrites.They were -- they compromised on abortion. They didn't actually believe it.STU: I mean, it's a fair criticism. Of course, I think one of the things that helps you get through it --GLENN: They didn't actually believe it.STU: -- is thinking of you as an individual, rather than as a cog in a wheel. Yes, we're a country. But we do have our own free agency here, to be able to kind of walk around and say, well, I'm fighting against that. Well, I'm doing what I can, to try to stop it.Yes. I live in a country, that allows it. But I'm still doing what I can.GLENN: Oh, my gosh. You sound like that racist Thomas Jefferson.STU: Oh, yeah. Well, no.GLENN: That's what our Founders believed.This is not a question of abortion. It's not a question -- it is posed because I do believe we're headed towards a Civil War.If we can't stop this. Because there is no compromise, when you say, the First Amendment is out. The Second Amendment is out.You know, abortion for all. And if you don't like it, we're going to change the Supreme Court. I don't know how you avoid a Civil War.So this popped into my mind. But this is really to show, all you self-righteous people, that believe, oh, I would have gone back in time. And I would have done.Would you? Would you?STU: Well, we look back --GLENN: Because the country is facing the same perilous times, and what are you willing to do, to save what you've just -- what we have!STU: This is why there's such problems with something like collective salvation. Right?You know, what do we -- when we along back at the Founders, and say, how could they have been -- the people who were alive at the founding. How could they be part of a country that did this terrible, terrible thing. And it was a terrible, terrible thing. But we don't look back at Ben Franklin that way.Right? We don't look back at Ben Franklin -- now, some of the left do, because they're insane.GLENN: You do.STU: Here's a guy, who is an abolitionist. Right? He fought against this. He fought against this practice. He blew up his economic life to fight against it. He did everything that he believed he could, to try to stop this terrible practice.And that's how you can deal with it, as an individual. You won't be able to control every law of your country. All you can do is take responsibility for your own actions. And the left wants to present a world in which that's not the case. Right?It doesn't matter if you specifically, are racist, or not. Are you part of a structure. Of structural racism, that you're supporting by being part of this nation, that's allowing X, Y, and Z. No. No. Actually, not being racist is a really big part of it. Right? Like, don't be personally racist, and if a lot of people can hit that standard, the world changes pretty quickly.GLENN: Yeah. Well, look at what people are saying now.They want to give -- they want to give -- what was it?63 or 53 percent of Democrats in this latest poll, we just revealed. They want to give the United Nations, an overriding power on our Supreme Court. And on our Congress.So are you with the blue rapists?So wait a minute. You are -- you want to give the power to the group of people, that, A, haven't solved a single world problem.And are deeply corrupt. And are raping people in countries where they're supposed to be protecting them.Wow. Sounds like to me, you're trading one evil for another evil.STU: Yeah. Well, and it's interesting. Because you -- the -- the standard that you kind of put out in this deal, where abortion would exist. But would not be expanded as it was back in the founding days. In some ways, is sort of what we have now, right?Some territories are going to have abortion. This sort of new world we live in over the past few weeks. Some will have it. Some aren't. It's going to be difficult to expand that right, in a lot of states. It may go away in some others. But generally speaking, you're going to see this split, I think for some time, going forward.And I don't want a Civil War over it. But, like, it's important to note, that people look at this. And they say, oh. Roe vs. Wade. It's a win. And it's definitely a step in the right direction. But it is not a win, per se.A win. Like this situation, where half the country, has abortion and some all the way on demand, up until the last month. Is not the conservative position. The conservative position is not everybody gets to do whatever they want, when it comes to killing babies. Like, that's not a position I'm comfortable with at all.I'm a big believer in federalism. But I believe the country also does have a responsibility to protect life. Not just in some areas. Not just in red states. Not just in red counties.It -- it has the responsibility to try to protect it, everywhere. It's -- it's sort of one of the promises of the founding documents. As you mentioned, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.All require had life. All three require people being alive.GLENN: Yeah.STU: So I think it is pretty crucial that we --GLENN: I just sold my house to a dead man.STU: Oh, really?GLENN: Yeah. Yeah. He doesn't have life. But he now has property. And a right to pursue his own happiness. So, anyway.   It almost feels like the chaos surrounding us today is too much. Weve had 7.2 million migrants illegally enter the U.S. since President Joe Biden took office. Weve got record inflation and violent crime rates. How did our country turn UPSIDE DOWN so fast? Glenn explains that whats happening today isnt actually chaos, because the definition of chaos is complete disorder and confusion. The people behind everything happening in our country today arent confused all. In fact, the current destruction America is experiencing today was by DESIGN. Glenn walks you through the playbook, which is borrowed from Barack Obama. The Obama playbook for fundamental transformation was something called Top Down, Bottom Up, and Inside Out. A similar plan was used by the Soviets to flip a capitalist Czechoslovakia to communist. The progressive U.S. version is modeled on a strategy written by American socialists from the 1960s called the Cloward-Piven Strategy. When Glenn first outlined this strategy over 10 years ago, the media mocked him, but no one is laughing now as the top pillars of society begin to crumble: government, culture, law and order, the economy, media and information. Topple just one of these, and you could force a country  even one as powerful as the United States  to fall.      Something just isnt right about what our country has become, and we all know it. Glenn reviews 9 stories that reveal how crazy things have gotten. New York City, for one, is facing crisis after crisis, including inflation, illegal immigration, and crime. When entire hotels are being rented out to house migrants, Glenn argues that we should stop and ask, WHO is paying for that?! And when theres a horse running on a highway in Philadelphia, maybe its time to just completely rethink the direction were heading in &    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I saw this last night, and I thought, can you play it? There it is. Yeah.Now, that's somebody with their phone. Outside of their window, on the driver's side, going, I can't -- I can't -- am I seeing this. I have to film this. Because I don't think anyone has ever seen that before.STU: Keeping up nicely with traffic though. Those were quick animals.GLENN: Yes. Yeah, I think that was an expensive -- well, it was -- it's that close to Philadelphia. You know, you don't keep one in a walkup. You know, a park -- you know --STU: That would be a strange choice.GLENN: It would a strange choice.STU: But, again, you also don't keep it on the highway. So who knows what's going on?GLENN: Right. Right.I mean, how did they find the onramp? It's a horse. How did they find the onramp?STU: Really fascinating.GLENN: There's a lot of questions on that one, but I don't think we're going to get to them.Now, let me show you some of the other things.And let's see if you can tie together, what I'm driving at.Okay. There is a method to the madness on the things I'm going to show you.These things I just saw last night.This isn't like, yeah. Well, I saw this a month ago.I've been saying.These are things, that I spent 20 minutes, just scrolling, going, wow.That one. That one.Okay.Let's so on let's start with cut 12, please.GLENN: All the New Yorkers in New York City, please, pay attention to what I'm about to say.I know this morning got a list from my controller, to tell us the tax annual assessments and values. This happens every January to February. I got mine. Just on a few of our properties, just a few of them, every single one of them are going up. Some of them are going up ten to 15 percent. All the way up to 60, 75 percent. You have no clue what this means to this industry.Now have clue, what this means to every average New Yorker.Everybody in New York City, is affected.Because I have stores here, supermarkets. $12,000. $14,000. I have -- I have small three-family buildings, renting them. Going up $9,000. Increase on top of the 30 thousands that I'm paying. .GLENN: That's crazy. That's crazy. Okay.So everybody is paying a lot more. That's weird.Cut -- cut 13. This is one about the hotels in New York.VOICE: Here is the hotel.VOICE: This is one of the hotels as transformed into the shelter.VOICE: We will walk in there.

We just follow orders.VOICE: They signed the contract with an outside source, saying they will pay them rent, in order for them to house the migrants. And the hotels love it because it is guaranteed money every single night. And that array of $200 per night at the hotel.And with 1,331 rooms, that is $260,000 a day. $1.8 million a week. And $7.2 million a month.GLENN: Okay. $7.2 million a month.For one hotel.One.Hotel.Who is -- who is writing that check again?Isn't that kind of important?Who is writing that check?One month, 7.2 million dollars.Oh, that makes me understand the -- the other guy, who is like, look at our assessment on our buildings.Bada bing.Up 75 percent tax.Bada bing.Okay. All right.So can we just play the horse running town, just because I need -- oh, there he is.Running down.(music)Now let me show you, can we take cut six, please.Cut six.VOICE: Some of those suburban areas.Are having double-digit car thefts with be in a week.Sometimes in a day. People are stealing tires at a record rate. There's no consequences, accountability, repercussions.GLENN: Hmm. Hmm. And there's problems CNN said with homelessness. Cut seven please.VOICE: The number of people experiencing homelessness in a single night. Went up 12 percent in a single night in 2023.In part, because COVID programs preventing evictions and housing losses came to an end.A quarter of those people were unhoused for the first time in their lives.VOICE: How many people fell into homelessness during COVID.VOICE: Before COVID, there were probably about 20 or 30,000 people. Now it's 46,000.GLENN: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Here is -- here, I think this is Curtis. Just standing on third avenue. Which when I lived in New York.You can't -- you can't stand in the middle of the street.Here he is on third Avenue.VOICE: This is something you'll never see in the middle of the day. Third Avenue in New York City.This is the future. When everybody leaves and heads to Florida.They're on the way to Texas. Tennessee, Georgia, South Carolina.Look. So what do we have here?Because they've all fled the city. And it will only be a city of criminals. Emotionally disturbed migrants. I am Nostradamus. I see what's coming in 2024. Vast sea of emptiness.GLENN: Well, that's good. That's good.So let's see, we have too many migrants coming in.More migrants, the collection of migrants that have been added to our country in the last three and a half years. Equal the population.Of 38 states in America.Equal or above the population of 38 -- we only have 50 states. I just want you to know that.We only have 50.38 of them are now smaller, than the people we have let in.That's into -- I mean, I mean -- that's interesting.And then we have some really, really.I mean, we have some real problems. And I'm glad that we're dealing. What are we focused on.Go ahead.VOICE: The whom who runs the bullying account, lives of TikTok. Was given a spot on the Oklahoma library board.

And you might want to shave just a little bit. And the low cut tress there is nice. But if we know maybe you would shave just -- anyway, this guy is having a serious conversation, about what's acceptable in the library. And people are just watching it and going, well, he's making a good point.He's not -- how!Play the damn horse, running down the --STU: Yeah.GLENN: How about this one?Cut 17.(music)JustVOICE: I've seen this question. My problem is, I'm too hot. I'm too successful in my career. I make too much money. I have too many amazing friends and family. Too many cute clothes. Do you know how hard it is, to choose an outfit each day?People sliding into my DMs every day.GLENN: Okay. Stop. It's a man with boobs. It's a woman with a beard. I don't -- I have -- I don't know.STU: They never had to deal with problems like that. They're too hot. People slipping into your DMs. This person has to deal with that every day.GLENN: Do you know how hard it is to pick out a set of clothes every day?No. I have no idea. I wear the same clothes. I have been wearing them since the third grade. What the hell is wrong with you?I swear to you, I mean, this story makes more sense than any other story I've seen today.Oh, wow. Look, a horse running down a highway in Philadelphia.When that becomes, eh.STU: That's the most sensible story we've talked about in this segment. Sometimes horses run county the highway.GLENN: Now, I would just like to point out. And maybe I've been in a coma. So I don't remember it. Sometimes you won't remember a coma. And you're all being nice, and you're like, don't say anything to him. He's forgotten he's been this a coma for 400 years. And we were in -- I don't know. Some freezer.I don't know how this happened. But maybe I've been in a coma. But from where I'm sitting, none of this is normal.May we just all take a moment and go, none of this is normal!This is not the way a civilization behaves.Am I alone on this?I don't --STU: Apparently so.GLENN: Apparently, I --STU: Apparently so. By the way, the horse is okay.GLENN: The horse is --STU: Yeah. The horse is okay.GLENN: That would be the thing. Out of this monologue. Somebody -- well, what happened to the horse?STU: I was --GLENN: It's those damn cars, and those SUVs. I don't know what they're doing there. They're killing the planet. Have you heard about the big umbrella that we want to put in space?Don't put big umbrellas in space. Are you out of your minds?Oh, man. I just -- if I was in a coma, I want the doctors to know, put me back into the coma, please.   Former president Donald Trump has warned the state of New York that businesses will flee if the civil fraud charges levied against him arent overturned. But New Yorks governor has promised that other businesses have nothing to worry about. So, is there cause for concern? Former investment banker Carol Roth joins Glenn to explain why this ruling should be horrifying for everybody who is in business. Plus, she addresses whether conservatives should celebrate as progressive organizations appear to backtrack on their woke agendas, or whether this is all an election season ploy.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Carol Roth, a former New York Wall Street banker, who, you know, woke up and went, what am I -- am I on the wrong side.And she has done an awful lot of good. She's the author now, of, you will own nothing. Former investment banker. I have her on, because I want to talk to her about BlackRock's new voting system.But she has a couple of things I want to let you know. First, she has a new newsletter out. CarolRoth.com/news. Sign up for it. CarolRoth.com/news.Carol, I wanted to start with you, because you are a former New York investment banker.What is the fallout going to be on this Donald Trump conviction and 355 million dollar fine?Never been done before, not even with the Gambino crime family they never did this.CAROL: Yeah. Okay. So just to be correct, San Francisco investment banker, because I don't want to lump myself with all of those New York investment bankers.GLENN: Like that's any better.(laughter)CAROL: So the complications of this are horrifying for everybody who is in business.When you think about presenting your company in the best light, whether it is a startup firm, a venture Capitol firm.A private equity firm.Real estate holdings.Any publicly or privately held company, that has adjusted EBITA.They are saying, here's what we think the business is. But we will put this in the best light.And what this particular judgment has done, in my opinion, has said, even if somebody hasn't gotten hurt.Even if the bank that you presented this to.Or the investor said, hey, we made a ton of money. We're not a counterparty to this suit.That the state can come in and say, well, we don't think this is right. We've done our own calculations. We see that you have some numbers that you got wrong here, and we are going to charge you with fraud civilly. Not criminally. Civilly.And then put in some insane judgment, that is basically like sitting your finger in there. And seeing which way the wind blows. Because there is no actual damages.The bank has said, that they were not victimized, that they made a ton of these.And so who really is the counterparty here.They are saying, there is some ill-gotten gain. They made this up.And this has an incredibly disturbing implication, for any business.If this is the standard, then basically, I would say, every business in the United States, somebody needs to be thrown in jail. And assessed hundreds of millions of dollars.Because this happens throughout all business. GLENN: Well, I will tell you, if Elon Musk were still in California, I bet he would be shaking in his boots. Because if this can happen in New York, it can happen in California.And they're already going after him, with all kinds of stuff. Even if you're on the right side currently, if your company ever falls against the state, on anything, you're opening yourself for the end.I mean, how -- how much of an impact will this have, on businesses being and locating themselves in New York?CAROL: Well, that's the interesting question. Because everybody thinks that it can't happen to them.Oh, it's Donald Trump. He's done all of these things that we've heard about in the media. This can never happen to me. And there's a lot of ego and a lot of hubris, particularly with the financial services and other companies that are based in New York City.We have seen some level of exodus based on crime, taxes. And other decisions.Obviously, the ones who have been savvy, have already gotten out of there. Started to decouple from New York.But I think the -- when something like this happens, they see this big personality, and they say, it can't happen to me.But why not?Why can't it happen to you?If you go against whatever the narrative is.If you go against the state. And, you know, you say something, that they don't like. This is -- you know, as we've talked about before. Sort of a soft form of social credit.You are not aligned with what we want. So we will find ways to penalize you, financially.GLENN: It's terrible.CAROL: And it is absolutely terrifying.GLENN: All right. So let me talk to you here. We have about six minutes here to talk about this.CAROL: Okay.GLENN: Justin Haskins. Who is my cowriter of my book.We talk about ESG and all of this stuff. All the time.Go back and forth.He's much -- if you think I'm a pessimist.He's more of a pessimist.He wrote to me the other day. Glenn, this is great news.The Europe ESG collapse. And now companies are getting out. Even BlackRock says they're getting out of it.And I said, whoa. Whoa. Whoa, whoa.We're entering the time of an election. And this is also what every progressive institution does.They are exposed.Oh, we're not going to do that with your gas stove.And then they do it, anyway, in another form.Are you -- I mean, we should celebrate that we have them on the ropes. But we believe so let the pressure up. We have to pursue them.Because they're trying to make an escape.CAROL: Yeah. I think this is the absolute perfect analogy. And I know Justin and we have conversations offline as well about all this stuff.And I do think there are a lot of things to celebrate.Because of the work that you and Justin have done, Glenn.Your audience has done in raising awareness.Some of these state level leadership. We are seeing a lot of shifts happening. You know, we saw JPMorgan. Pimco. State Street. All extract themselves from the climate 100-plus pledge, which is basically financial institutions. Cracking down on companies. And trying to push them into this ESG, these directives. And so we just saw that happen this week. And part of that is because they are afraid of the legislation, and -- and being hit with lawsuits. In fact, BlackRock, which shifted from the US being part of it. To just Europe being part of it.Within -- they cited lawsuits. Potential lawsuits, as one of the concerns. So this is -- come from The New York Times. Main Street media. They are concerned, but it's not fluff.And, you know, that goes back to this new BlackRock voting initiative. Proxy voting initiative. Where they don't want to be the ones to take the blame. And say, well, we're not pushing this. You're voting for it.Instead of, you know, going ahead, and giving you the ultimate choice on how to vote.They will give you options. But of their options, almost all of them has to do -- I know this will shock you, Glenn. With climate or climate impact. Or environment.Social responsibility.GLENN: Wow. So I could have Soviet communism, Chinese communism, or --CAROL: Or North Korean.GLENN: Or North Korean communism. But I can choose. I can choose. Wow. That's quite a choice.CAROL: Yeah. And it's -- I was going to say --GLENN: Go ahead. CAROL: I was going to say. The way they're doing it is obviously, they've been paying attention to your program. Because they're trying to really manipulate you in one direction or another.They have this one choice, that's called the ISS Catholic faith-based policy.So you're going, oh, okay. That's great. That's going to be aligned potentially with my rales. And patriotic values. But what they say is, quote, it's aligned with social responsibility. And quote, the active ownership. And investment philosophies of -- I'm sorry. Broadly consistent with the objectives of socially responsible shareholders, as well as the teachings of Catholicism and Christianity.And then they talk about social, environmental impact. That they're going along with the social and environmental philosophies of Catholic-based teaching.GLENN: That's unbelievable.STEPHEN: They're really trying to make sure you don't read this. And say, oh, this will be aligned with my values.They're just pushing in a different way to manipulate you. So now they can say you're the (inaudible).GLENN: Unbelievable. So damn evil.CAROL: It is.GLENN: I am looking at all of the things that are happening. Like the farmers. You know, that's -- that's kind of calmed down now over in Europe. Because the politicians said, you know what, you're right. You're right. We're not going to push those things. We're going to hold. We're going to hold. There's an election coming up this summer. But after the election, we'll bring that back up. And I think you're right. And I think the farmers might be dumb enough to think they won. But they didn't win.You cannot -- this is like -- any good war strategy.You cannot let them regroup. Fall back and regroup someplace else. You must pursue them, at some point.Because they're going to keep doing it over and over. They'll just pop up someplace else, or under a different name. Or another new way to manipulate, the reality.And you have to -- if you don't pursue them, you have to start all over again.CAROL: Yeah. So the farmers have obviously been very brave. And they've b",-9,-9,
BECKNews_37," Linda Coffee, the Dallas lawyer who first launched the landmark Supreme Court case Roe v.Wade that legalized abortion nationwide, decided to sell all of the case documents, from the first papers filed at the Texas District Court to the quill pens given to her during oral arguments before the Supreme Court. She decided to auction off her archive to ""inspire"" the next generation of pro-choice activists in light of the Supreme Court's Dobbs ruling that overturned her landmark case. Coffee's partner Rebecca Hartt said:  Coffee and Hartt couldn't have imagined who would end up buying the documents: Glenn Beck.  Glenn said the following upon acquiring the documents: Glenn has long been an ardent supporters of the pro-life movementstanding up for pro-life Americans under attack from the Left, promoting organizations such as Pre-Born on his radio program, and interviewing pro-life activists to name a few examples. So why did he purchase the documents from the Supreme Court case that legalized abortion? Glenn and his wife, Tania, said the following: Instead of being purchased by a left-wing activist who would have heralded the documents as a sort of relic, Glenn wanted to make sure they were purchased by someone who would treat them as they are: the signed death sentence of 60 million children in our country from 1973 to 2022.   Now, Glenn is giving YOU access to the documents so that you can learn about the history of this caseand how to make sure that it is never repeated in the future. The slide show below contains 48 images of the 150  documents that went into Roe v. Wade.  The two quill pens given to Linda Coffee, by the Supreme Court, an honor given to lawyers who argue cases before the nation's highest court.     WRITER  Texas is under threat of a George Soros-backed takeover. Soros-funded RINO judges have been elected in some of the highest courts in Texas. These judges implemented restrictions that have blocked nearly a thousand cases of voter fraud from being investigated or prosecuted from across the state. These new restrictions are similar to ones in place in states like George, Arizona, and Wisconsin, leaving Texas more susceptible to election corruption than ever. If Texas falls to corruption, America will lose its largest bastion of conse""vative electoral power in the nation. Without Texas, Republicans WILL NOT be able to win national elections and liberal corruption will go unchecked across the country.  Fortunately, there is a way to stop this: YOU. If you live in Texas you have a chance to stand up against corruption and to fight back! Starting Tuesday, February 20th, early voting for the primaries begins, where three of these judges are up for election. Go out and vote. If the right people are voted in, there's a good chance the restrictions will be lifted and election fraud can once again be prosecuted.  But remember, you can't just go in and vote for anyone who has an ""R"" next to their name. Sorors knows that a registered Democrat would never stand a chance in Texas, so his lackeys register as Republicans and ride the little ""R"" right into office. So who do you vote for?  Fortunately, Glenn had Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on his show today and Ken gave us his list of judges that he vouches for. His list is as follows:    WRITER  Who is really banning books? For years now, Conservatives have been taking flak from the left for supposed ""book bans."" The left likes to compare these ""bans"" to Nazi book burnings, accusing the right of sweeping authoritarian decrees designed to suppress information. In reality, this is a movement largely motivated by parents, who want to remove inappropriate books from children's libraries.  But if you want to discuss authoritarian book bans, look no further than the White House. As Glenn recently covered, the Biden administration has been pressuring the world's largest bookseller, Amazon, into suppressing books they disagree with. On February 5th, 2024, Ohio Representative Jim Jordan released a slew of subpoenaed documents that exposed pressure placed on Amazon by the Biden Administration. The documents, which Jordan dubbed ""The Amazon Files"" after Elon Musk's ""The Twitter Files,"" revealed an email conversation between Andrew Slavitt, a former White House senior adviser, and Amazon employees. In these emails, Slavitt complained that the top search results for books on ""vaccines"" were ""concerning"" and then requested that Amazon intervene. Amazon initially refused, not out of some altruistic concern for the free exchange of information. They thought any action taken would be ""too visible"" and would further exasperate the ??Harry/Sally narrative,?? referring to the outrage that followed Amazon's removal of Ryan T. Anderson??s book When Harry Became Sally.  Despite this initial refusal, Amazon agreed to meet with the White House a few days later. The number one item on their agenda was""oving books from the website. An Amazon employee even admitted that the reason they even took this meeting was due to the pressure being placed on them by the Biden Administration.  What was the result of this meeting? Amazon caved. They began to implement ways of limiting the outreach of books that challenged the mainstream vaccine narrative and other books the White House might not like. The White House was caught red-handed pressuring the world's largest bookseller to restrict the sale of books they consider in opposition to their narrative, and they have the gall to accuse conservatives of information suppression. This is just ONE of many actions committed by the Biden Administration that are more characteristic of a dictator than a president. What can you do about it? Fortunately, you are not dependent on Amazon and its corrupted algorithm to help you find books. Every week right here on GlennBeck.com, we highlight books that Glenn is reading or talking about in our ""Glenn's Bookshelf"" series. Here you can find a wide selection of books free from Amazon's filters. Be sure to sign up for Glenn's newsletter to find out about new additions to ""Glenn's Bookshelf"" every week.    WRITER   The left-wing media's most recent tirade is accusing Trump of being a dictator. But, as Glenn said, ""Everything they're accusing us of, they're doing."" Since day one, the Biden administration has overstepped the bounds placed on the executive branch set by the Constitution. In Glenn's most recent TV Special, he examined ten times Biden acted like a dictator, NOT a president. Here are 10 of Biden's Dictator Moves, and click HERE to get ALL of the research that went into this week's Glenn TV special:     WRITER   Every day it seems Glenn covers another story revealing how people across the world at all levels of power DESPISE the fact that YOU have rights, and they are actively trying to curtail them. Recently, there has been a string of attacks against the rights outlined in the First Amendment: the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, the freedom of assembly, and the freedom to petition. As a refresher, the First Amendment reads as follows: This is powerful stuff, there is a good reason the Founding Fathers made it the FIRST Amendment. It's also the reason why power-hungry elites are attacking it. These attacks are designed to control the way you think, speak, and believe, vote, what you read, and who holds your representatives responsible. The First Amendment is our strongest weapon against tyrants, and they know it. So what can you do about it? Hope that some wig in Washinton will eventually do something? We know how well that works. The best thing to do is to stay active, engage in the issues you care about, and exercise your rights.  So where to start? Here are a few things YOU can do to protect your First Amendment rights:                                Religion                                   The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is toyou guessed itpractice your faith. Become an active member in your place of worship, go to scripture studies, invite your friends to that late afternoon event, and walk the life. This can impact the way you spend money as well. Shop the businesses and brands that share your values, and don't shop at the ones that scorn them. Keeping the community alive and healthy is the best way to ensure that generations to come will be able to experience the freedom you enjoy.                              Speech                                   Much like religion, the best way to protect your freedom of speech is... to speak. Engage your friends and family in polite, civil conversation. Stand up for what you believe in, and make your case to your peers. Just remember to keep it friendly. No one ever won an argument by shouting down their opponent. The civil exchange of ideas is the cornerstone of our republic, and a dialogue where the participants are well-informed, considerate, compassionate, and open-minded can have permanent impacts on all involved.                              Press                                   Freedom of the Press seems a little tricky at first. Unless you work for the media, what are you supposed to do? Quit your job and go work for the local newspaper? The good news is that exercising this right is not nearly that difficult. In fact, you are currently doing it. The best thing you can do is to read from outlets that produce informative content. Want to know what Glenn consumes to stay informed every day?

Assembly                                    Anna Moneymaker / Staff | Getty ImagesFreedom of assembly is one of the more impactful yet underutilized freedoms in the First Amendment. Peaceably assembling and protesting with like-minded individuals can hugely influence politicians and policies while simultaneously creating community and fellowship between attendees. It's understandable why more people don't turn out. We're all busy people with busy schedules, and flying out to D.C. for the weekend seems like a daunting task to many. Thankfully, you don't have to go out all the way to D.C. to make a difference. Gather some like-minded people in your town and bring awareness to issues that impact your community. Big change starts locally, and exercising your freedom to assemble can be the catalyst to lasting impact.                               Petition                                   If you've been a long-time listener of Glenn, then you will have heard a few of his calls to action where he asks his audience to contact their representatives about a particular piece of policy. There is a good reason Glenn keeps on doing those: they work. Whether it's your local mayor or your senator, a call and an email go a long way. If you really want to make a change, convince your friends and family to reach out as well. The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is to??you guessed it??practice your faith. Become an active member in your place of worship, go to scripture studies, invite your friends to that late afternoon event, and walk the life. This can impact the way you spend money as well. Shop the businesses and brands that share your values, and don't shop at the ones that scorn them.

Tomorrow, the United States of America will have its 247th birthday, and the activists in corporate media couldnt be more miserable about it.  Their joylessness is always the same. So, if youre looking for a way to be miserable on the 4th of July, a holiday devoted to vibrant, breathtaking explosions in the sky, then scroll through mainstream media. Youll find tons of editorials by people who will spend tomorrow full of hatred for BBQs, pools, parties, and, well, fun. Last year, the New York Times celebrated the 4th of July with an article by Paul Krugman, one of the few people smug enough to blame right-wing America for the Climate Apocalypse. The media is obsessed with apocalyptic language. They love to fantasize about the end of America. Way back in 2010, the publication Salonpredicted America would collapse by 2025. These days, theyve shifted to blaming Christianity and American fascism. The Washington Post has declared the end of white Christian America. Christianity, they tell us, is part of the reason America is racist. Theyve fantasized about All the ways America could come to an end. Over the last six years, they have?published?multiple?articles?announcing ??the end of American Exceptionalism.?? The most recent one came out the day after the January 6th incident.  They have blamed guns, Republicans, comedy, ??transphobia.?? They have blamed the ??ignorance and irrationality?? of people who disagreed with vaccine mandates. They??ve repeatedly blamed anyone who dislikes woke culture. But most of all, they have blamed Trump. They swore he would cause ??the end of America??s role as a defender of freedom.?? In that article, they actually portrayed Woodrow Wilson as a defender of Democracy. An article in the Guardianargu"" repeal of Roe v Wade brought America one step closer to civil war and that ??the left-democratic wing of America is the productive and educated part of the country.?? Ahead of the 2020 election, Rolling Stonepredicted Covid would cause the end of the American Era and America would be replaced by Scandinavian socialism and Chinese authoritarianism. During Trump??s presidency, the Atlantic devoted all their energy to proving Trump would cause the end of America, with an endless flow of articles about ??How Trump is Ending the American Era.?? David Brooks loves accusing conservatives of having an ??apocalyptic tone?? and inventing ??apocalyptic menaces,?? as he put it in his article, ??The Terrifying Future of the American Right.?? Despite the fact that he has boosted his career by""rump as the AntiChrist. Or his article about how ??The nuclear family was a mistake?? for America. Or his article for the New York Timeswarning about ??The Coming GOP Apocalypse.?? The Atlantic has devoted entire issues to the inevitable collapse of America, like this one from December of 2021. For the one-year anniversary of January 6th, the theme was ??January 6 Was Only Practice.?? In it, George Packer wrote, ??Are We Doomed??? He argued that ??the Republican Party now functions like an insurgency.?? Describing Republicans?? election laws, he said ??the danger is that the express will of the American people could be overthrown.?? The New York Times is obsessed with the apocalypse of America. On the one-year anniversary of Trump??s election to the White House, Michelle Goldberg wrote about the ??Anniversary of the Apocalypse.?? She asked: In a series devoted to attacking Tucker Carlson, they described Tucker??s worldview as ??apocalyptic,""nd and push the idea that the apocalypse is everywhere. They have warned about The Academic Apocalypse. Theyve asked, How Do You Invest in the Face of an Apocalypse? Theyve described plays and fashion shows as post-apocalyptic. In July of last year, the New York Times declared Apocalypse Right Now. In February of 2022 they ran an article titled Apocalypse When? The author wrote: They even ran a guide called How to Survive the Apocalypse. By the way, you can even find a similar guide on National Geographic Kids, 7 Steps To Surviving An Apocalypse (According To Science!) What would YOU do if the world was ending? Remember that one kid when you were growing up who always made up the rules on the fly? Usually because they couldnt win any other way. The media is that annoying kidbecause they only talk about the end of America when things aren't going their way. As Christians, we talk about the apocalypse, but its completely different. In fact, its the opposite of what the media is saying, and they cant see the difference. For us, its a matter of faith. We trust in God, in the eternal Light that is bigger and deeper and brighter than we could know. We believe in Truth, in the Truth that moves through us. We believe that the Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. The word ??apocalypse?? comes from the Ancient Greek word meaning ??revelation?? or ??unvei"" the discovery of something new that has been hidden or invisible. Christians used the term to describe the Second Coming, when ??everything that is hidden will eventually be brought into the open, and every secret will be brought to light.?? (Mark 4:22) The media's religion is everything they accuse Christianity of??a religion of superstition and fear. Only, for them, there is no redemption. Only total destruction. I think we??ll find that we??ve been right all along. I just hope America survives all of the media's doom and violence. WRITER  Texas is under threat of a George Soros-backed takeover. Soros-funded RINO judges have been elected in some of the highest courts in Texas. These judges implemented restrictions that have blocked nearly a thousand cases of voter fraud from being investigated or prosecuted from across the "" These new restrictions are similar to ones in place in states like George, Arizona, and Wisconsin, leaving Texas more susceptible to election corruption than ever. If Texas falls to corruption, America will lose its largest bastion of conservative electoral power in the nation. Without Texas, Republicans WILL NOT be able to win national elections and liberal corruption will go unchecked across the country.  Fortunately, there is a way to stop this: YOU. If you live in Texas you have a chance to stand up against corruption and to fight back! Starting Tuesday, February 20th, early voting for the primaries begins, where three of these judges are up for election. Go out and vote. If the right people are voted in, there's a good chance the restrictions will be lifted and election fraud can once again be prosecuted.  But remember, you can't just go in and vote for anyone who has an ""R"" next to their name. Sorors knows that a registered Democrat would never stand a chance in Texas, so his lackeys register as Republicans and ride the little ""R"" right into office. So who do you vote for?  Fortunately, Glenn had Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on his show today and Ken gave us his list of judges that he vouches for. His list is as follows:    WRITER  Who is really banning books? For years now, Conservatives have been taking flak from the left for supposed ""book bans."" The left likes to compare these ""bans"" to Nazi book burnings, accusing the right of sweeping authoritarian decrees designed to suppress information. In reality, this is a movement largely motivated by parents, who want to remove inappropriate books from children's libraries.  But if you want to discuss authoritarian book bans, look no further than the White House. As Glenn recently covered, the Biden administration has been pressuring the world's largest bookseller, Amazon, into suppressing books they disagree with. On February 5th, 2024, Ohio Representative Jim Jordan released a slew of subpoenaed documents that exposed pressure placed on Amazon by the Biden Administration. The documents, which Jordan dubbed ""The Amazon Files"" after Elon Musk's ""The Twitter Files,"" revealed an email conversation between Andrew Slavitt, a former White House senior adviser, and Amazon employees. In these emails, Slavitt complained that the top search results for books on ""vaccines"" were ""concerning"" and then requested that Amazon intervene. Amazon initially refused, not out of some altruistic concern for the free exchange of information. They thought any action taken would be ""too visible"" and would further exasperate the ??Harry/Sally narrative,?? referring to the outrage that followed Amazon's removal of Ryan T. Anderson??s book When Harry Became Sally.  Despite this initial refusal, Amazon agreed to meet with the White House a few days later. The number one item on their agenda was""oving books from the website. An Amazon employee even admitted that the reason they even took this meeting was due to the pressure being placed on them by the Biden Administration.  What was the result of this meeting? Amazon caved. They began to implement ways of limiting the outreach of books that challenged the mainstream vaccine narrative and other books the White House might not like. The White House was caught red-handed pressuring the world's largest bookseller to restrict the sale of books they consider in opposition to their narrative, and they have the gall to accuse conservatives of information suppression. This is just ONE of many actions committed by the Biden Administration that are more characteristic of a dictator than a president. What can you do about it? Fortunately, you are not dependent on Amazon and its corrupted algorithm to help you find books. Every week right here on GlennBeck.com, we highlight books that Glenn is reading or talking about in our ""Glenn's Bookshelf"" series. Here you can find a wide selection of books free from Amazon's filters. Be sure to sign up for Glenn's newsletter to find out about new additions to ""Glenn's Bookshelf"" every week.    WRITER   The left-wing media's most recent tirade is accusing Trump of being a dictator. But, as Glenn said, ""Everything they're accusing us of, they're doing."" Since day one, the Biden administration has overstepped the bounds placed on the executive branch set by the Constitution. In Glenn's most recent TV Special, he examined ten times Biden acted like a dictator, NOT a president. Here are 10 of Biden's Dictator Moves, and click HERE to get ALL of the research that went into this week's Glenn TV special:     WRITER   Every day it seems Glenn covers another story revealing how people across the world at all levels of power DESPISE the fact that YOU have rights, and they are actively trying to curtail them. Recently, there has been a string of attacks against the rights outlined in the First Amendment: the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, the freedom of assembly, and the freedom to petition. As a refresher, the First Amendment reads as follows: This is powerful stuff, there is a good reason the Founding Fathers made it the FIRST Amendment. It's also the reason why power-hungry elites are attacking it. These attacks are designed to control the way you think, speak, and believe, vote, what you read, and who holds your representatives responsible. The First Amendment is our strongest weapon against tyrants, and they know it. So what can you do about it? Hope that ",-9,-8,
BECKNews_40," CompassCare Pregnancy Services in Buffalo, New York recently endured a VICIOUS attack from the far-left. The building was destroyed, CEO Jim Harden tells Glenn: Glass was broken and fires lit, because we do not comply with the ruling elite's position, he says. But a strike like this may be proof the far-left is fully aware actions taken by the pro-life movement are WORKING: The abortion industry is scrambling, he says. Plus, Harden describes what YOU can do to help this center continue to provide important healthcare for women...    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: You know, I -- I was telling somebody who was up here at the ranch yesterday, we were talking about how to solve America's problems. And I said, one of the biggest things we have to do. Is we have to return to the philosophy of George Washington. We have to be people of merit. We have to merit and earn the -- the right to even be able to ask God, can you help us with our problems? And that doesn't mean doing the things we want to do. That doesn't mean, getting God on our side. God is, believe it or not, on everybody's side. However, he can only help the people that are walking in his footsteps. Especially when we are facing evil. You can't have anything to do with evil. And malice. And revenge. And anger. Those do not come from him. So we need to look for things that we can do. And I'm on a kick this year, to this audience. I would like to see us raise enough money to save 50,000 children from being aborted. And I'll tell you about it later. But we have to have these centers around. And they are coming under attack. This is the third now pregnancy service, that has been attacked. This up, just happened outside of Buffalo, I believe. It's up -- up in upstate New York. And the CEO, James Harden is on with us now. It's Compass Care pregnancy services. And so you know, James is a guy, who has really done so much for life. He has -- he came up with the first measurable and repeatable medical model in the pregnancy center movement, which has helped hundreds of centers nationwide become more effective at reaching more women and saving more babies from abortion. There's a reason that they selected his abortion center. Their Buffalo office was the one that was hit. Welcome to the program, James Harden.  JAMES: Glenn, it's an honor to be with you. Thanks for having me on. GLENN: You bet. So tell me what happened, first of all. This happened in the middle of the night. Everybody is safe, right? What happened? JAMES: This is the pro-abortion Kristallnacht. What happened was gas was broken, and fires lit, because we do not comply with the ruling elite's position, that we should be referring and providing for abortion.  Women do not feel like they have a choice when they are facing a pregnancy. They feel stuck, trapped, like they've got no choice. Like they need to have an abortion. And what we do, is we erase the need for abortion, by transforming what we see in confidence, with ethical medical care and comprehensive community support, throughout the pregnancy and beyond. And they targeted women that night. They targeted women. This is a -- it's heinous. The building is totally destroyed. We got essentially 25 percent fire damage, 100 percent smoke damage. It's going to take months to repair. Hundreds of thousands of dollars. But, you know, the church in Western New York has rallied. We didn't lose one single patient that day, and we've relocated to a secure, undisclosed location, and we're serving patients, serving patients and up and running yesterday. They meant to shut us down, and we soldiered on. GLENN: I have to tell you, I can't believe we're living in the days that I never really, truly could understand, when I would read and good would be evil. And evil would be called good. Look at what's happening. You're going underground, because you refuse to kill children. JAMES: Exactly right. I'm with you 100 percent, Glenn. I can't believe we're living in these days, either. When good is called evil. And evil is called good. Everything is upside down. And what's bothering me right now, is that there are politicians, that are refuse to go denounce the violence against pro-life pregnancy centers. They're refusing to say, hey. This is wrong. Violence is wrong everywhere, all the time. This is not how you solve problems. And their silence can only be interpreted as complicity, and it's emboldening these terrorists. GLENN: Yes.  JAMES: This is a national -- GLENN: Okay. So -- I know it is. So tell me what's happening in New York. The governor of New York, earmarked millions of dollars to help pay for, you know, women to travel to New York for abortions. They're allocating more money to beef up security, for abortion providers. And they don't even seem really interested in finding out who did this, with you. JAMES: No. The FBI is involved. The FBI has been involved since before the firebombing. Because we have threats. And they knew it was coming. And Kathy Hochul. Governor Hochul has refused to denounce the violence against pro-life pregnancy centers. Furthermore, she added insult to injury, by getting the legislature to pass a bill to investigate pregnancy centers. What is that? She should be vetoing that bill. GLENN: What do you mean investigating pregnancy -- what are they investigating you for? JAMES: For -- for how we're potentially harming women's ability to access health care, and their -- in unmet resource needs. We are their health care and unmet resource need provider. And they are going to investigate -- they need to redirect the funds that they're sending to this investigation, to investigate the true criminals. Where is Letitia James, the attorney general? Why isn't she investigating criminals that are -- GLENN: If you live in New York, you need to be on the phone, with your legislators and your governor and the attorney general, probably most importantly. And ask them where they are. Why are they not investigating these things? The -- on your building, Jane was here, was spray-painted on the building. What do you know about the group that is Jane's revenge, and how sure is anybody that they were the ones that did it? JAMES: Well, Jane's Revenge is the organization that has been inciting violence against pro-life activity, specifically pro-life pregnancy centers. Jane's revenge refers to Jane's collective. Which is an underground abortion, you know, activist group, in the 1960s, in Chicago. And they provided abortions out of people's houses. And so Jane's revenge, is afraid that Roe vs. Wade is going to get reversed, and they're doing everything they can with respect to using terror, to shut down any kind of pro-life activity.  But, you know what, when Roe vs. Wade. As you know, Glenn. If Roe vs. Wade is reversed by the Supreme Court in the coming weeks, it doesn't end abortion. It just concentrates abortion off-state, like New York. We're already seeing women coming from Texas, to receive services here. GLENN: Right. You -- you are going to live in a state. Because I -- you know, when the regulator is off. And they feel like they -- they're making a point. I'm telling you, they're going to start killing children after birth. They're just going to let them die. And it will be totally legal to do that. And the choice will be clear for so many people. Are you going to be a part of a state that is -- that is actually involved in this evil. Or will you go some place, and give your tax dollars to their place, that is doing the opposite? And trying to save lives. And, you know, it's interesting, Jim. You know, I've been doing some workable with preborn. And you are cut from the same cloth, I think. And it's -- it's not just about saving the baby. It is the aftercare and the care that goes all the way along, with the child, that is so important. That nobody is -- nobody on the left will do. JAMES: Exactly. No. No. I defy anyone to find an abortionist, who will provide any care, other than what they get paid for. And that's only abortion. They will only do abortion, and they're only going to get paid for it. But we do everything for free. We provide all this ethical medical care and comprehensive community support for free. They're not lifting a finger for these women. They're not providing -- you know what abortion is? Abortion is abandonment. That's society's way of saying, we don't want anything to do with this. But the community rallies around women through pregnancy centers, pro-life pregnancy centers. Because we believe, we believe that everyone is made in the image of God. And therefore, equally, valuable and deserving of protection. That's where dignity emanates for the human being. And we've lost that. Because we've lost the belief that we all, human beings are the crown of creation, and must be protected. Even the people, that live in the dark. And firebombed our clinic the other day. Those people are also made in God's image, and deserving a blessing of protection. And we're calling them out to life. GLENN: Jim, how can we help you? First of all, let me just ask the audience. Please, if you have money. And I know money is tight. So you have to be careful where you're giving money. But I'm telling you, God's blessings will rain down on us. If we are protecting God's children. All of God's children. If we don't strike out in violence. If we live the teachings of Jesus Christ. And we help on this front. It -- it may be the difference of survival, and not. For our nation. So erasing the need.com/donate. The money will go to compass care pregnancy services, so they can continue their work. They can rebuild and be secure. Erasingtheneed.com/donate. Please, first thing, make a donation. What else can people do? JAMES: What else can people do? They can pray. Pray for wisdom. Pray for strength. Pray for unity. Pray that the violence will end. Also, people can act. Beyond giving. Certainly, they can -- they can give. We have a national strategy. And our strategy is working. And that's why we've been attacked. We know that the abortion battle lines are shifting. And the abortion industry is scrambling. And the reason why they attack us, is what they're doing to reduce abortion, is working. And we have a model to expand services and infrastructure throughout New York State. To handle the increased load. We're at Buffalo, Rochester, Albany, expanding into the city. It's working, Glenn. And we've got a model -- all the abortion states to follow. And they know it. And what you can do, everybody can do this. Everybody can go to prolifepregnancycenter.com and sign a petition that will go to Joe Biden and other politicians like New York Governor Hochul, demanding that they denounce the violence to pro-life pregnancy centers, and veto this heinous, nefarious, frivolous investigation bill against pregnancy centers in New York. GLENN: I never thought, Jim, that pro-life and -- and this fight would be the thing that would bring us together. JAMES: Yeah. GLENN: I always -- I always saw it as a divisive issue. And I spent many years of my career, probably half of my career, not even talking about abortion. Because it was so divisive. But I have to tell you, I think it is the thing that will in the end, unite us. And unite us in a way of peace. And -- and healing. JAMES: Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Abortion represents a flash point of culture, that forces us to think about the value of humanity. You know, abortion represents a fundamental misunderstandings of what it means to be human under God. And if we take the lessons that we're learning right now, society can -- can rehumanize. We can return to civilized order. You know, the only way to do this is to follow in the footsteps of Christ. He died on the cross for us. But we can put up a center before God, who would die of exposure of our sins. And he said, I'm going to die for you. But you can go and do likewise. Go and do likewise for the weak and vulnerable. There's no one weaker in our society. No one in our society, than a woman who thinks she has been no choice but to end the life of her child. And the child in her womb, whose mother thinks she has to abort. There is no one weaker. And that is how you walk in the footsteps of Jesus. You serve them, you love them, you protect them, you bless them. GLENN: Thank you so much, Jim. You feel free. Keep our number. You call me any time you need anything. All right? JAMES: Thank you, Glenn. GLENN: Is your staff mentally okay? JAMES: Our staff, our morale is high. But I can tell you, we're getting a little tired. We've got a lot of work ahead of us. But no one is flagging -- no one is failing. Everybody is doing a fantastic job. And the people, New Yorkers in general, are rallying. It's a wonderful thing to see. You know what Satan means for evil, God will turn for his good. GLENN: Yes, he will. Jim, thank you very much. It's Jim Harden, CEO Of Compass Care Services. You can donate and help at erasingtheneed.com/donate. This is why we have taken on another sponsor. Preborn.com/Beck. We took them on as a sponsor on TheBlaze. And they really do so much good. We have to stand together, and help the children, help the children live. Back in a minute.  The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechani",-9,-8,
BECKNews_41," The New York Times recently wrote about discussions within the Biden administration concerning next steps if the Supreme Court ends Roe v. Wade. According to the Times, Top aides are weighing whether he can or should take a series of executive actions to help women in Republican-controlled states obtain abortions& Some of their ideas currently under consideration are SHOCKING. Glenn details them, like a national public health emergency, and more risky ones, like inviting doctors to perform the procedure on federal MILITARY bases&  Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Let me tell you something from the New York Times. I think you're going to love this. Biden has already put together a team to come up with options in case Roe vs. Wade is overturned. Including declaring a national public health emergency. Now, Stu, gosh, don't you wish there was someone that could have warned the American people, that this administration is just going to start issuing national emergencies.STU: It might be a time to remind people to describe to Blaze TV. At BlazeTV.com/Glenn. With the promo code Glenn to save ten bucks.GLENN: Oh, yeah. All right. So here's what it is: In case they overturn Roe vs. Wade, the intent of the Biden administration, is to make sure the FDA approves abortion pills, that would override any state bans on abortion, so you can -- you can buy the pills. They'll send them to you. And, you know, that way you'll be able to roll around in pain on the floor of your bathroom, and it will be wonderful. See, they care about women.The -- the abortion team is overseen by the White House lawyer Dana Remus. She's the director of the White House gender policy council. Now, could I ask you this: The United States has an entire council on gender, in the White House? I mean, that seems like something like -- you know, maybe the White House shouldn't be engaged in. You know, with a whole counsel. Do they have an office? Is there a wing now? A gender wing?STU: It really is disturbing chain of events here. I really thought this was simple. There really was a time and it wasn't that long ago, that it was pretty easy to figure out. There was a boy, there was a girl. We kind of all understood. There was the men are from Mars. Women are from Venus thing. Like, how many planets would you need now, to put this together?GLENN: Oh, you only need one, because there's no difference between them. And we can't identify anybody. So it's just kind of like the Grand Central planet. Whatever planet that is. And I think we've actually been transported to that planet, Stu. Because I don't recognize this as the earth I grew up on. So Dana Remus is part of it. She's the gender policy council. Also, Jennifer Klein. She's the director of the domestic policy council. Led by Susan Rice. Which I just love that. Now, one of the plans under consideration is to bring abortion doctors to work on U.S. military bases within states that ban abortion. So not only is your government -- remember, we will never pay for abortion.That's crazy! Taxpayers going to -- now, our military base, will be an abortion center. I got to tell you, at some point, I stopped paying taxes.STU: Hmm.GLENN: I don't know what that point is, because I really don't want to go to jail. But at some point, you're morally -- you will be morally convicted, for this. Wouldn't you? I mean, you want your tax dollars going to pay for a military, that is also performing abortions against the law?STU: Look, I -- I agree with you on being morally offensive.GLENN: Wow. What won't they do?STU: I will say, if I adopt that standard, I'm going to have to break into the IRS offices, and reclaim a lot of tax dollars, that I did not feel morally -- that were acceptably paid. You know, it's tough. You go down these roads. And it's like, I don't stand down for a lot of this stuff that my taxes go to. In fact, I don't stand at all, even for the tax itself. I consider it to be essentially theft. And the first thing I would let them do is go and repeal the Sixteenth Amendment to get rid of it forever.GLENN: Yeah. That's a good point.STU: But that being said, I don't know that that's not really --GLENN: Yeah. I think you -- I think there's a federal case to be made. I mean, I really do. I mean, I'm not one to go, I'm not paying my taxes. Out of protest. Because I know what would happen to me. I would be in a very, very dark cell, and never heard from again.STU: Right.GLENN: But I also believe that rule of law. But is there not a case to be made, that you said, first of all, my tax dollars won't go to pay for abortion. Now you're using the military to break the law that the Supreme Court just said, the states have the right. You're using the military to do it?Anyway, they're also looking to provide federal funds to give travel expenses to those who want an abortion. So they don't do it at the military base. They'll just say, you know what, guess who got -- guess who has a free trip to New York free abortion clinics. You do. And you do and you do.So that's -- that's -- you know, that's really good. By the way, he talked about this with Jimmy Kimmel. He said, I'm looking at different things that can be used as executive orders. This goes back to the show we did this week. FDR is the most executive orders will -- I think he's in the end. No. Because he had four terms. But he's going to be close to FDR on executive orders. He's ruling everything from the executive office. Everything.STU: Yeah. And that was his big goal. To try to become the next FDR. That was the big goal behind the scenes. His advisers were talking him into it. Be bold. Be the next FDR. And of course, he may get to some of the records that FDR sent over four terms, but it will be things like inflation and debt and utter catastrophe.GLENN: Yes. Right. So let me give you this one: The vice president, Kamala Harris, has announced the launch of a task to address online harassment and abuse. Harris praised the task in her remarks, as a means for societal progress. We need -- we need the klaxon air horn for this one. Whenever you hear societal for progress -- societal progress, you should look out. No one should have to endure abuse. Just because they're attempting to participate in society. Oh, my gosh! I don't think I can take that. I don't think I can remain silent on that because, boy, wouldn't I love to show you the abuse I've taken just so I can participate in society.A memo on the task, released by the White House, condemned gendered disinformation. And proclaimed the administration will be developing programs and policies to address online harassment, abuse, and disinformation campaigns, targeting women and LGBTQI plus. These -- they are going to stop the harassment, the abuse, and the disinformation on those who are public and political figures. Government and civic leaders, activists, and journalists, in the United States and globally. I think -- now, I could be wrong, Stu. But I -- man, I -- I think that rings the big warning bell on the First Amendment. This is government now, curtailing speech.STU: Yeah. I think you're right on that. And I understand, they have to give Kamala something to do, other than just utter nonsensical, you know, gibberish in a speech here and there. Because that's been pretty much her role so far. I know she's supposed to solve the border. She's supposed to solve Ukraine for a while. Now they've got a her on speech. I don't know, to me, when you start doing stuff like this, you really do walk that line of First Amendment violation, and I will not be surprised if there's any teeth to it, at all. That places like Texas, will start suing over it.GLENN: You know, I have to tell you, I'm so sick of your -- your misinformation and disinformation. On Kamala Harris. Here she is. This was brilliant. This was from the speech, where she was talking about the internet. And I think we can all learn from this. Listen.VOICE: Well, the internet is an essential part of life in the 21st century. Can't get around it. Can't get around without it.GLENN: Wow.STU: That's fantastic.GLENN: Such brilliance. It spills right out of her. She can't keep it inside.   Elon Musk has announced that the first Neuralink patient can now control a computer mouse by just thinking. But while this technology could help a lot of people, should we proceed with caution? Between AI and this new merger of man and machine, Glenn gives a warning about what the future could hold. Glenn and Stu also review the controversy surrounding Googles Gemini AI, which refused to generate images of white people.     Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: So the website, Down Detector, detected a surge in outage reports from users at AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Customer Cellular, Boost Mobile, US Cellular, and Straight Talk.That the reports of the system being downed or outages, began at 3:45 a.m. Eastern time. The outages have been reported across many major US cities.It looks like, that it is back up. I'm not sure.They say, they don't think this was a cyber attack.But how did all of them go down at the same time?I mean, that's kind of weird.Yesterday, Israel had a cyber attack.It was from Iran. The Israelis say. And it was an attack on their cell phone services.So quite a coincidence. But let's not jump to any conclusions. Let's see what actually happened.Cyber attacks are going to happen. At some point, soon. We will have cyber attacks. And it will leave you vulnerable, if that's what you depend on.We are becoming more and more, a society that is connected in all things, and absolutely incapable of doing any things, without our electronics.We hit a milestone yesterday. This is truly like landing a man on the moon, I think. This is -- this is the first real merging of man and machine, I think. I mean, we've had the electronic. You know, the bionic arms and things like that.But this is in your mind.It's Neuralink. Elon Musk came up with it. And it is really tempting, because this is -- you know, this will be great to some degree. You'll be able to access information, and have the old internet in your head. You want to speak French?Okay. Download it. Got it.I mean, it is really -- isn't that the Matrix?STU: Yeah. The Matrix too. We're turning into The Matrix. That's the theme of the show today. GLENN: So that is now the beginnings of that, happened and was announced yesterday. Elon Musk said, Neuralink is active in the first person, to have one of the chips implanted in their brain. They have seemingly made a full recovery.We -- you know, so far. We don't know what the effects of this are, or will be. But Musk said, the patient can now move the mouse around a screen, just by thinking.So he has Bluetoothed himself to the screen.Crazy. Huh.STU: It's incredible that they can do that. And, you know, also, look at the way Elon Musk does business.This is a lot of what he does. Which is a lot of kind of just -- let's try it. There's a lot of -- hey, let's give it a whirl.GLENN: He said I think yesterday or earlier this week, that he had plans by 2029, to have a million people on Mars.And when I heard that, I thought, there's no -- oh, it's Elon Musk. Maybe.STU: Well, yeah. And this is his goal, with all of this stuff. He has -- I think it's a T-shirt or something. He wears. Like occupy mars.This is the central idea of his life.GLENN: And this is part of it. Neuralink is part of it.He believes that we are on such a dystopian track right now. That because of global warming, but also because of AI.He believes AI is just as dangerous as global warming. He believes we cannot compete with AI.Unless we can merge with it. Okay.Because it will be operating at such high speeds. We don't have the processing capabilities for the speeds.You know, it's kind of like -- kind of like dogs. Dog life. Seven years. One year for us.It's like one year is a thousand years for AI.So it's moving at such a rapid speed, we won't be able to keep up. So he believes that we need to be able to merge with the machine, until we can get off, this planet.I don't think he'll be taking Neuralink with him. Or maybe he just thinks we won't have access to this AI on Mars.But that's really what is -- is driving him. Driving his whole life.STU: It's really, really hard.Because I know, it feels creepy. And there are risks. And all of that.But it's like, it's really, really hard to think about telling someone, who is paralyzed that, no. We could make you move. But we don't want to pursue that technology.Like, I don't know. I mean, it's just -- it's such incredible technology.And for all of the other stuff, that he's done. Which is really impressive. I mean, Elon Musk is an impressive dude.Space travel. You know, the electric car stuff. I don't care about the electric car stuff that much. But it's still really impressive what he's been able to do.Everyone basically said, you couldn't do it. And no other company could be able to do that. He did that. He's done so many incredible things. But if he was able to take people, you know, with disabilities. And all these -- these issues that have been unsolvable throughout all of human history, and somehow figure out a way to -- through Neuralink or something similar, to solve that for people, it would be the greatest thing he has ever accomplished by a long shot.GLENN: So my daughter Mary had brain surgery, about three, four years ago.STU: Yeah. I remember.GLENN: And it was perfect for a long time.All of her seizures went away. Earlier this year, I think it was in the summer, she started to have breakthrough seizures.And they are even on medication now, they are grand mal. They are --STU: Hmm.GLENN: They're just terrifying. And -- and I said to her, this was about four years ago.I said, honey, if you wait. Elon Musk is doing experience with Neuralink.And one of the things that Neuralink will do. Is it will -- you know, patch all of the brain damage.It will take where -- when you have a stroke, it's like a highway.And there's you all these highways running to different parts of your brain. And if you have a stroke, that highway is cut.So there are other paths to get to where it's going, but it makes it much slower. And sometimes it can't just get to where it's supposed to go.STU: You can't get there from here.GLENN: You can't get there from here.So Neuralink will connect the different parts of the brain, back to each other.And it doesn't need roadway. It's just Bluetooth to all the different parts of the brain, it needs.In effect --STU: Incredible.GLENN: Yeah. Incredible. Absolutely incredible.You know what she said to me.Dad, I think I'll wait.Because I know the savior will heal me, even if it's just in the afterlife.STU: Jeez.GLENN: What a giant.STU: Raised a good kid there, jeez.GLENN: I had nothing to do with it. Nothing to do with it.STU: That's incredible.GLENN: So we have this now. We have what I've been talking about, the singularity, the merging of man and machine. And also, what I've been talking -- I've been talking about this particular category for 30 years, plus. And I said, there's going to come a time, merging man and machine. There's also going to come a time, where you cannot believe your eyes or your ears. We're there now. Did you hear about -- what was her name.Bobbi Althoff. Did you read about this? Bobbi Althoff, apparently, a very sexually explicit video of -- she's a podcast person. Spread on X, all day yesterday.This was -- they tried to get it down as fast as they can. But it was just populating everywhere. And it's a complete deepfake. But you can't tell it's a deepfake. Okay?It looks absolutely real, apparently. And she had to come out and say, this -- I mean, violation of me, you know, this goes beyond violation of privacy.STU: What was the -- the video?Was it like one of these --GLENN: Yeah. It was sexually explicit. It was a porn tape.STU: Like the Taylor Swift stuff that came out.GLENN: Yeah. Okay.But you cannot tell the difference. We are at the point to where you don't know what's real and what's want.We are also now, and I find this fascinating.We're -- in one of my early books, where I talked about AI. I remember saying, don't fear the system.Don't fear AI.Don't fear the machine. Fear the programmers and the algorithms. Because whatever you put into that algorithm, it becomes reality. And it's the basis of everything.Okay.Google, they had the bard. What happened to the bard. The bard has become General Artificial Intelligence. So Google, the Gemini can not only answer all of your questions, but it can also just type in, and it will create a scene for you.Okay.Apparently, it has no problem, producing images of black, Native American, and Asian people, when prompted.But it refused to do so, with white people.STU: I mean, I know this is serious. But it was also really funny. Like, if you would request like give me a picture of an antebellum plantation owner. And it would just be like an Asian and a Native American.GLENN: Right.STU: They couldn't find -- just could not bring themselves to create white people.GLENN: No. No.You're asked to show a white person. George Washington. Gemini said, it could not fulfill the request. Because, and I'm quoting, it reinforces harmful stereotypes and generalizations about people based on their race.STU: Amazing. They knew the founders, that it would come up like all the Founders would be. All these different races.GLENN: Races. It's important to remember, that people of all races are individuals with unique experiences and perspectives. Reducing them to a single image based on their skin color is an inaccurate statement and unfair.We have to be more inclusive and equitable.STU: That's our point. Our point is we shouldn't reduce people to their skin color. You guys are constantly pushing that nonsense on us all the time.GLENN: Quote, when you ask for a picture of a white person, you're implicitly asking for an image that embodies a stereotyped view of whiteness.This can be damaging both to individuals who don't fit those stereotypes and to a society as a whole. As it reinforces biased views.Unbelievable.Unbelievable.So Fox followed this down the rabbit hole. And Google replied immediately. And took it down.Oh, yeah. We're working on that. But are you?STU: Right. They obviously didn't intend for it to do this.But what they did put in there, is bias.GLENN: Is bias.STU: And you're not just supposed to notice it. It's supposed to be much more subtle, than it wound up turning out being. And that's what they will go back and fix.GLENN: Right. They won't go back and fix it and take that out. They will fix it, so you don't notice it.By the way, AI currently is going throughout all of the history of the world, all over, it is suddenly changing our documents, our history books, and everything else.Anything that's online. If you don't have a paper copy of something, you're going to find yourself in your lifetime, sooner rather than later, going, well, no. Wait. I know that was there.I was there. I saw it.Wait. And I know it was reported.What? It's being done right now.STU: Uh-huh.GLENN: Clay pots comes to mind.   Many Americans across the country woke up on Thursday morning without cell service. But we still dont know what caused the outage, which greatly affected AT&T customers, as well as some users of Verizon and T-Mobile. Was it a solar flare? Or was it a massive cyberattack? Either way, many Americans got a small taste of what life would be like after such an attack. So, are you prepared for an even bigger cellular outage, which would wipe out much more than your cell service: food, water, medicine, our entire supply chain? Glenn speaks with One Second After author William Forstchen, who has been warning about the devastating effects of an EMP or cyberattack for years. He and Glenn explain what you should have on hand to be ready.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors  It almost feels like the chaos surrounding us today is too much. Weve had 7.2 million migrants illegally enter the U.S. since President Joe Biden took office. Weve got record inflation and violent crime rates. How did our country turn UPSIDE DOWN so fast? Glenn explains that whats happening today isnt actually chaos, because the definition of chaos is complete disorder and confusion. The people behind everything happening in our country today arent confused all. In fact, the current destruction America is experiencing today was by DESIGN. Glenn walks you through the playbook, which is borrowed from Barack Obama. The Obama playbook for fundamental transformation was something called Top Down, Bottom Up, and Inside Out. A similar plan was used by the Soviets to flip a capitalist Czechoslovakia to communist. The progressive U.S. version is modeled on a strategy written by American socialists from the 1960s called the Cloward-Piven Strategy. When Glenn first outlined this strategy over 10 years ago, the media mocked him, but no one is laughing now as the top pillars of society begin to crumble: government, culture, law and order, the economy, media and information. Topple just one of these, and you could force a country  even one as powerful as the United States  to fall.      Something just isnt right about what our country has become, and we all know it. Glenn reviews 9 stories that reveal how crazy things have gotten. New York City, for one, is facing crisis after crisis, including inflation, illegal immigration, and crime. When entire hotels are being rented out to house migrants, Glenn argues that we should stop and ask, WHO is paying for that?! And when theres a horse running on a highway in Philadelphia, maybe its time to just completely rethink the direction were heading in &    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I saw this last night, and I thought, can you play it? There it is. Yeah.Now, that's somebody with their phone. Outside of their window, on the driver's side, going, I can't -- I can't -- am I seeing this. I have to film this. Because I don't think anyone has ever seen that before.STU: Keeping up nicely with traffic though. Those were quick animals.GLENN: Yes. Yeah, I think that was an expensive -- well, it was -- it's that close to Philadelphia. You know, you don't keep one in a walkup. You know, a park -- you know --STU: That would be a strange choice.GLENN: It would a strange choice.STU: But, again, you also don't keep it on the highway. So who knows what's going on?GLENN: Right. Right.I mean, how did they find the onramp? It's a horse. How did they find the onramp?STU: Really fascinating.GLENN: There's a lot of questions on that one, but I don't think we're going to get to them.Now, let me show you some of the other things.And let's see if you can tie together, what I'm driving at.Okay. There is a method to the madness on the things I'm going to show you.These things I just saw last night.This isn't like, yeah. Well, I saw this a month ago.I've been saying.These are things, that I spent 20 minutes, just scrolling, going, wow.That one. That one.Okay.Let's so on let's start with cut 12, please.GLENN: All the New Yorkers in New York City, please, pay attention to what I'm about to say.I know this morning got a list from my controller, to tell us the tax annual assessments and values. This happens every January to February. I got mine. Just on a few of our properties, just a few of them, every single one of them are going up. Some of them are going up ten to 15 percent. All the way up to 60, 75 percent. You have no clue what this means to this industry.Now have clue, what this means to every average New Yorker.Everybody in New York City, is affected.Because I have stores here, supermarkets. $12,000. $14,000. I have -- I have small three-family buildings, renting them. Going up $9,000. Increase on top of the 30 thousands that I'm paying. .GLENN: That's crazy. That's crazy. Okay.So everybody is paying a lot more. That's weird.Cut -- cut 13. This is one about the hotels in New York.VOICE: Here is the hotel.VOICE: This is one of the hotels as transformed into the shelter.VOICE: We will walk in there. And see what kind of operation they're running inside.VOICE: Really nice hotel.VOICE: How is it going?VOICE: Oh, yeah. We're just checking in on the hotel. There's a ton of people in here.GLENN: Because it's a shelter.VOICE: Oh.VOICE: Migrants going in?VOICE: Yeah. It's no longer --VOICE: How many floors is this?VOICE: Thirty floors.GLENN: Thirty.Is it full? Yeah.VOICE: You guys aren't allowed to talk about it? Why do you think it's a big secret, Duke?GLENN: I don't know. We just follow orders.VOICE: They signed the contract with an outside source, saying they will pay them rent, in order for them to house the migrants.

BECKNews_42," A heated debate during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on abortion has gone viral after Berkeley Law Professor Khiara Bridges accused Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) of asking ""transphobic"" questions that could ""open up trans people to violence."" While multiple prominent media figures jumped to join Bridges in labeling the GOP senator as ""transphobic"" for preferring the word ""women"" over ""people with a capacity for pregnancy,"" very few are willing to discuss the actual topic of the hearing, and this includes the liberal professor herself.  Asked by Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas ) if she thinks ""a baby that is not yet born has value,"" Bridges flat out refused to answer, saying instead, ""I believe that a person with a capacity for pregnancy has value. They have intelligence. They have agency. They have abilities."" ""I said the baby,"" Cornyn stated. ""And I'm talking about the person with the capacity for pregnancy,"" Bridges repeated. ""You're not answering the question I'm asking,"" said Cornyn. ""I'm answering a more interesting question to me,"" came Bridges' completely ludicrous reply. On the radio program Wednesday, Glenn Beck, Stu Burguiere, and Pat Gray all agreed that the progressive left has completely abandoned reality, and Professor Bridges' outlandish performance just proved it. But the worst part of the exchange is Bridges' arrogance throughout it all ?? which, Glenn explained, actually may be the flaw that ultimately causes its own defeat.

WRITER   The left-wing media's most recent tirade is accusing Trump of being a dictator. But, as Glenn said, ""rything they're accusing us of, they're doing."" Since day one, the Biden administration has overstepped the bounds placed on the executive branch set by the Constitution. In Glenn's most recent TV Special, he examined ten times Biden acted like a dictator, NOT a president. Here are 10 of Biden's Dictator Moves, and click HERE to get ALL of the research that went into this week's Glenn TV special:     WRITER   Every day it seems Glenn covers another story revealing how people across the world at all levels of power DESPISE the fact that YOU have rights, and they are actively trying to curtail them. Recently, there has been a string of attacks against the rights outlined in the First Amendment: the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, the freedom of assembly, and the freedom to petition. As a refresher, the First Amendment reads as follows: This is powerful stuff, there is a good reason the Founding Fathers made it the FIRST Amendment. It's also the reason why power-hungry elites are attacking it. These attacks are designed to control the way you think, speak, and believe, vote, what you read, and who holds your representatives responsible. The First Amendment is our strongest weapon against tyrants, and they know it. So what can you do about it? Hope that some wig in Washinton will eventually do something? We know how well that works. The best thing to do is to stay active, engage in the issues you care about, and exercise your rights.  So where to start? Here are a few things YOU can do to protect your First Amendment rights:                                Religion                                   The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is toyou guessed itpractice your faith. Become an active member in your place of worship, go to scripture studies, invite your friends to that late afternoon event, and walk the life. This can impact the way you spend money as well. Shop the businesses and brands that share your values, and don't shop at the ones that scorn them. Keeping the community alive and healthy is the best way to ensure that generations to come will be able to experience the freedom you enjoy.                              Speech                                   Much like religion, the best way to protect your freedom of speech is... to speak. Engage your friends and family in polite, civil conversation. Stand up for what you believe in, and make your case to your peers. Just remember to keep it friendly. No one ever won an argument by shouting down their opponent. The civil exchange of ideas is the cornerstone of our republic, and a dialogue where the participants are well-informed, considerate, compassionate, and open-minded can have permanent impacts on all involved.                              Press                                   Freedom of the Press seems a little tricky at first. Unless you work for the media, what are you supposed to do? Quit your job and go work for the local newspaper? The good news is that exercising this right is not nearly that difficult. In fact, you are currently doing it. The best thing you can do is to read from outlets that produce informative content. Want to know what Glenn consumes to stay informed every day?

Assembly                                    Anna Moneymaker / Staff | Getty ImagesFreedom of assembly is one of the more impactful yet underutilized freedoms in the First Amendment. Peaceably assembling and protesting with like-minded individuals can hugely influence politicians and policies while simultaneously creating community and fellowship between attendees. It's understandable why more people don't turn out. We're all busy people with busy schedules, and flying out to D.C. for the weekend seems like a daunting task to many. Thankfully, you don't have to go out all the way to D.C. to make a difference. Gather some like-minded people in your town and bring awareness to issues that impact your community. Big change starts locally, and exercising your freedom to assemble can be the catalyst to lasting impact.                               Petition                                   If you've been a long-time listener of Glenn, then you will have heard a few of his calls to action where he asks his audience to contact their representatives about a particular piece of policy. There is a good reason Glenn keeps on doing those: they work. Whether it's your local mayor or your senator, a call and an email go a long way. If you really want to make a change, convince your friends and family to reach out as well. The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is toyou guessed itpractice your faith.

WRITER   The crisis on the southern border has reached a boiling point following the controversial Supreme Court ruling that allowed the federal government to remove large portions of border security, triggering a movement of conservative governors defending Texas' right to protect its border.  We comm""nly hear about the border crisis through mainstream media as if it's an abstract issue that has little to no effect on our daily lives. However, for millions of Americans, the border crisis is in their backyard... literally... bringing crime up to their front doorstep??and it's coming to your doorstep soon.  These five stories paint a glimpse of the type of crime and cartel activity that is being enabled by the Biden administration's border policies.                                Assault and robbery in Massachusetts                                   On January 15th, Lucas Vilaca Moreira Fontenelle was arrested in Milford, Massac""setts for armed robbery of a bodega along with two other illegals a few days earlier. This comes just one month after ICE detained Fontenelle for assault, but the city of Milford cut him free as part of their status as a sanctuary city.                              Murder in New Your City                                   On January 6th, Moises Coronado chased down, beat, and fatally stabbed Dafren Canizalez while in a NYC shelter. Coronado illegally crossed the Texas border in November where he was detained before being released and making his way to New York.                               Cartel trafficking in El Paso                                   Late last month U.S. Border Patrol agents operating in the El Paso region arrested a cartel ""foot guide"" that was responsible for trafficking dozens of illegal immigrants across the border. The foot guide is a member of the La Linea Cartel, an operation based out of Juarez, Mexico whose gang warfare contributed to the city's 1,000+ homicides in 2023 alone.                               Human smuggling in Arizona                                   Last November, two teenagers were pulled over with five illegal immigrants in their car. The teens are being charged with human trafficking, and there is evidence that this was not their first trip. Authorities believe that these teens are the latest in a dangerous new trend of cartels using social media to pay teens to smuggle migrants across the border.                              Cartel trespassing in Arizona                                   Late last December, an Arizona rancher reported that he has seen a disturbing rise of cartel activity on his land. According to the rancher, he has seen evidence of cartels fighting for control of routes that pass through his property. He has even seen cartel scouts and human smugglers several times.

WRITER   On last week's Glenn TV special, Glenn dove into exactly how migrants from around the world are ending up on our southern border. The most shocking discovery, which was first published by investigators with Muckraker, was that multiple organizations have been providing maps showing immigrants exactly how to cross Central America and Mexico into the waiting hands of the cartel, who smuggle them across our border.  Just who is encouraging these people to make this perilous journey? You will likely recognize a few. Below are FIVE organizations that facilitate the crisis on our southern border.

BECKNews_43," America is facing dark times, and some recent news stories show were even facing EVIL. In this clip, Glenn describes 4 recent news stories that you should be aware of: The weaponization of the DOJ, FBI, and CIA (and how it relates to Joe Bidens documents scandal), a recent confession by Hunter Biden, an outright lie from Democrats about the alleged gas stove ban, and a SHOCKING, upcoming health clinic. So, how do these stories all relate? Glenn explains it all&    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: let me show you a couple of things, that should very well concern you.The first story comes from the Blaze. Carefully worded statement reveals FBI seized more documents from Biden property. This time, his vacation home.Okay? This happened yesterday. They searched for about three and a half hours. FBI agents say, they discovered no classified documents. But they did seize material from Biden's tenure as vice president.So they did this, they took stuff from his house. Why? This is a sitting president. Why?We know the DOJ is in Biden's pocket.We know that the administration has weaponized the FBI for the left.But is that the president, or is that Deep State that has done this?This is extraordinarily disturbing. That they're going into a sitting president's house, and doing this.And we don't really know, what's going on. We haven't even had a discussion. We just accept it.What will that mean, for the next president.And the president after that.Hunter Biden also, yesterday, admitted the laptop is his.And that he left it, and that's his laptop.This is some sort of twisted strategy, to now go after all those who reported on the laptop. Because they didn't have a right to that information.But now. After how many years, of all of us knowing, including those in -- in the press. Everyone knowing that that laptop is real.Now he finally comes out and says it's real. Will anyone in the press, care? Or will they follow the next bouncing ball and go after all those who talked about it?Remember, the FBI and the CIA, and NSA, they have loaded themselves in, to all of the big tech companies. They are everywhere in big tech.Why? Why is that happening?What is -- what is the government and big tech doing?Are they protecting you, or are they protecting people like -- oh, I don't know. Hunter Biden. Or Kathy Hochul.Kind of a theme that you need to have, always with you now, is I know who has lied to me, over and over again.I know who has lied to me. Do you know who has told you the truth, or tried to tell you the truth, to the best of their ability?Who is making corrections in the errors of their way. That is crucial. Bill Maher is doing this.Bill Maher is making corrections in the errors of his way. He's like, you know what, I didn't see this. I didn't believe this. This has got to stop. Who is doing that? And who is just doubling down on their lost credibility.The media told us, two weeks ago, that nobody is coming after your gas stove. You remember that clearly?We told you, that this is something that had to do with the E and the ESG. We showed you that it was an environmentalist paper and a research paper from that environmentalist group. That the department of -- what was it? It's not Labor that Trumka is in charge of.I can't remember. But one of the departments he's the head of. He came out and he said, we're looking into the gas stove things. It can be really, really very dangerous. And then they said, no. That's not true. That's not happening.Well, in governor Hochul's new budget, she has proposed several things that are nuts. But this is one of them.Hochul's budget plan would ban the sale of gas stoves, and other fuel-powered heating equipment, by 2030.And require that all new buildings be zero emission starting in 2028. Smaller buildings would be required to go green in 2025.So now who is lying to you? Who is lying to you?Is Katie Hochul just making this up?Or has this been discussed for a long time, and she's just willing to do it, because she knows, I just got reelected. It's not going to be a problem here?What you're dealing with, is absolute evil. Evil.Now, let me give you direct evidence.Stu, how would you feel, if you wanted to go to a doctor. And you knew the doctor was an atheist, but a really food doctor.What would you do?STU: I probably would just go to the doctor, and not care really what religion he was. That's kind of his situation.GLENN: Kind of his situation, right. Right. Right.As long as he's a really good doctor. Right.STU: Right.GLENN: Now, how would you feel if you found out, your doctor was a practicing Satanist? But he was the best doctor in that field.STU: It's a -- it's a good question. Like, I don't necessarily -- you know, a huge swath of our audience will be offended by this.I don't necessarily consider Satanism to actually be a religion.So I would probably be pretty skeptical of their general judgment in that case.GLENN: Would you go to them?STU: I don't think so. No.GLENN: Yeah. Okay. I wouldn't. There's no thought with me. Oh, you're a Satanist?Really? They're not coming to you. Okay. No thanks. How would you feel if the hospital was a Satanist hospital?STU: Yeah. I would pick a different hospital in that case.GLENN: Pick a different hospital. There is a new health clinic in New Mexico, being opened by The Satanic Temple.It is -- they're actually going to name the facility this. The Samuel Alito's mother's Satanic Abortion Clinic. So they are now opening up an abortion clinic.And they are providing free of charge, as part of The Satanic Temple's abortion ritual. You'll to pay for your medication and pharmacy. Typical cost is about 90 bucks. So you can get your abortion free, as part of a satanic ritual.Now, they put those in quotation marks. Because they want you to know, well, we're just fooling around here. We're not really The Satanic Temple.We're just trying to make a point. We're not really doing rituals with it. Really? Really?Huh.STU: I think their goal seems to be to make a point there. And I guess own the conservatives. But man, if it doesn't track with exactly what I believe is true in this case.You know, it's like, you seem to be making our point. The fact that the Satanists are adopting this process, as central to their being, is pretty telling. And honestly, I think it tracks perfectly.GLENN: Right. And they are going to be receiving government benefits and privileges. Because it's a -- a religious organization.But without a deity, they don't really believe in the Satan.And what they're trying to do is open this up.Now, they say, this is going to be -- doctors are going to be fine working there. And there will be good, qualified doctors.I would question any doctor, that worked at the satanic abortion clinic.You know. You know, everybody is like, oh, this doctor is a Catholic. And he won't perform abortions, at Our Lady of Weeping and open sores.I can't see -- really? But you'll go to a Satanist.And a Satanist. A doctor will go, I'm fine with the Satan thing, whatever.I'm doing a good thing, and a good service. Boy, if this does not make you question absolutely everything, that you think you know, I don't know what does.   The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy people on the left. The AOC's have taken over, places in the media.And places like this in New York.This is what it is thousand. So there's been one case. One. One in the entire seven years. Where they did this.Where they shut down a company, that had no obvious victims.The case was 1972.And it was a company, relatively small company, that was writing term papers, for college students. Okay.So I want to write my paper.GLENN: I want to break out in God bless America.STU: Capitalism is pretty impressive. Apparently, this didn't go over that well.What they said, there were no obvious victims here. The people bought the term papers. They didn't want to write them. They got the term papers. They said, they were defrauding the education system.GLENN: Which they were.STU: This is the one time. And it's a small tiny company. Let me give you the other times they've done this.Tell me if any of these sound like, hey, I have a good interest rate, on a loan I paid back.Number one, a breast cancer nonprofit was shut down a dozen years ago. For using nearly all its $9 million in donations to pay for director's salaries, perks, and other expenses, instead of funding free mammograms. Okay.So they told everyone, donate money for free. Mammograms. And they just took all the money for themselves.That's number one. Number two, a private equity timber.Faking big investment success, was closed down after stealing millions of dollars from thousands of investors.Okay?You can see.GLENN: Yeah. Got it. But on both of those so far, you have hundreds of thousands of people, you know, I'm sure. That gave -- they're all victims.They gave their money.STU: Yeah. And they didn't get the thing that they want.GLENN: They didn't get the thing they were promised. You have all these people going to the AG. Saying, hey, this is a real problem here. This has to stop. Not here.GLENN: Not here.STU: Another one. Mental health facility, shuttered for looting $4 million from public funds, while neglecting patients.GLENN: Okay. Kind of a big one.STU: Pretty clear. An auto lender that allegedly charged hidden interest rates, got to stay in business last year if it paid a fine and didn't commit fraud in the future.So here's one they didn't shut down.They actually let them go on.They're going after Trump in all of this. In this one, they're like, oh. Sure, they're hidden fees.They're not telling you about them.GLENN: Okay.STU: A judge requested.A judge refused to request to shut down a river rafting company in 2011.After a customer drowned, and the attorney general showed it was repeatedly using unlicensed guides, or none at all.Instead, he ordered only a 50,000-dollar bond and cleanup -- for him to clean up his act.The company is still being run today, under a different name by the same family. Someone died.GLENN: We have thousands of victims.And in this case, somebody who is dead.STU: Is dead!GLENN: Dead!STU: They're like, you guys can stay open -- and then this one is my favorite one. A judge in 2001.Declined to appoint a receiver, to take over a porn site, despite millions of dollars of illegal credit card charges to hundreds of customers.Who thought they were getting a free tour.Now, look, you're -- you want to get the free -- you want to know what you're subscribing for, Glenn. Before you just pulled the trigger on that. So you put your credit card information into a porn site, I think some of these victims need some life changes to be made here.But they put their credit card into a porn site. Expecting a free tour.They instead, get charged and charged and charged and charged.In fact, once the owners of the site were caught, they attempted to move their money overseas, to avoid any penalty.Still, the judge said, appointing a receiver was an extraordinary remedy!That should be used sparingly, and that a preliminary injunction was good enough.Only after all that happened, it they find out, the people running the porn site, were the Gambino crime family.(laughter)I kid you not. The Gambino crime family.GLENN: And they didn't go into receivership.STU: So there you go. Think about that.I mean, it's so obvious, what they're doing. Latitia james talked about it when she ran.Her goal was to take this one individual out.And the New York -- the voters of New York, said, good.Go do it.And now she's doing it.GLENN: Okay. If you are -- if you have business in in New York, if you're in New York, I'm just telling you. You have to do what you have to do.There's no way, I would keep my business in New York.There is no rule of law now. You know it on the streets. But there is no rule of law. If they can get away with this. They can do anything to you.   Elon Musk has announced that the first Neuralink patient can now control a computer mouse ",-10,-9,
BECKNews_44,"  	President Joe Biden, the ""repeater media,"" and a lot of others on the left were quick to politicize the horrific story of a 10-year-old rape victim in Ohio who was forced to travel across state lines to receive an abortion. But the more information that comes out about this case, the more disturbing and sickening it gets.  PJ Medias Megan Fox, who is one of the few journalists trying to get to the bottom of all this, joined Glenn Beck on the radio program Thursday with her latest findings and even more questions that remain unanswered:     	Watch the video clip below to hear Megan provide new details that ultimately suggest the unimaginable: The far-left may have covered up the truth about this heartbreaking crime in order to push its pro-abortion agenda.

WRITER  Texas is under threat of a George Soros-backed takeover. Soros-funded RINO judges have been elected in some of the highest courts in Texas. These judges implemented restrictions that have blocked nearly a thousand cases of voter fraud from being investigated or prosecuted from across the state. These new restrictions are similar to ones in place in states like George, Arizona, and Wisconsin, leaving Texas more susceptible to election corruption tha"" ever. If Texas falls to corruption, America will lose its largest bastion of conservative electoral power in the nation. Without Texas, Republicans WILL NOT be able to win national elections and liberal corruption will go unchecked across the country.  Fortunately, there is a way to stop this: YOU. If you live in Texas you have a chance to stand up against corruption and to fight back! Starting Tuesday, February 20th, early voting for the primaries begins, where three of these judges are up for election. Go out and vote. If the right people are voted in, there's a good chance the restrictions will be lifted and election fraud can once again be prosecuted.  But remember, you can't just go in and vote for anyone who has an ""R"" next to their name. Sorors knows that a registered Democrat would never stand a chance in Texas, so his lackeys register as Republicans and ride the little ""R"" right into office. So who do you vote for?  Fortunately, Glenn had Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on his show today and Ken gave us his list of judges that he vouches for. His list is as follows:    WRITER  Who is really banning books? For years now, Conservatives have been taking flak from the left for supposed ""book bans."" The left likes to compare these ""bans"" to Nazi book burnings, accusing the right of sweeping authoritarian decrees designed to suppress information. In reality, this is a movement largely motivated by parents, who want to remove inappropriate books from children's libraries.  But if you want to discuss authoritarian book bans, look no further than the White House. As Glenn recently covered, the Biden administration has been pressuring the world's largest bookseller, Amazon, into suppressing books they disagree with. On February 5th, 2024, Ohio Representative Jim Jordan released a slew of subpoenaed documents that exposed pressure placed on Amazon by the Biden Administration. The documents, which Jordan dubbed ""The Amazon Files"" after Elon Musk's ""The Twitter Files,"" revealed an email conversation between Andrew Slavitt, a former White House senior adviser, and Amazon employees. In these emails, Slavitt complained that the top search results for books on ""vaccines"" were ""concerning"" and then requested that Amazon intervene. Amazon initially refused, not out of some altruistic concern for the free exchange of information. They thought any action taken would be ""too visible"" and would further exasperate the ??Harry/Sally narrative,?? referring to the outrage that followed Amazon's removal of Ryan T. Anderson??s book When Harry Became Sally.  Despite this initial refusal, Amazon agreed to meet with the White House a few days later. The number one item on their agenda was""oving books from the website. An Amazon employee even admitted that the reason they even took this meeting was due to the pressure being placed on them by the Biden Administration.  What was the result of this meeting? Amazon caved. They began to implement ways of limiting the outreach of books that challenged the mainstream vaccine narrative and other books the White House might not like. The White House was caught red-handed pressuring the world's largest bookseller to restrict the sale of books they consider in opposition to their narrative, and they have the gall to accuse conservatives of information suppression. This is just ONE of many actions committed by the Biden Administration that are more characteristic of a dictator than a president. What can you do about it? Fortunately, you are not dependent on Amazon and its corrupted algorithm to help you find books. Every week right here on GlennBeck.com, we highlight books that Glenn is reading or talking about in our ""Glenn's Bookshelf"" series. Here you can find a wide selection of books free from Amazon's filters. Be sure to sign up for Glenn's newsletter to find out about new additions to ""Glenn's Bookshelf"" every week.    WRITER   The left-wing media's most recent tirade is accusing Trump of being a dictator. But, as Glenn said, ""Everything they're accusing us of, they're doing."" Since day one, the Biden administration has overstepped the bounds placed on the executive branch set by the Constitution. In Glenn's most recent TV Special, he examined ten times Biden acted like a dictator, NOT a president. Here are 10 of Biden's Dictator Moves, and click HERE to get ALL of the research that went into this week's Glenn TV special:     WRITER   Every day it seems Glenn covers another story revealing how people across the world at all levels of power DESPISE the fact that YOU have rights, and they are actively trying to curtail them. Recently, there has been a string of attacks against the rights outlined in the First Amendment: the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, the freedom of assembly, and the freedom to petition. As a refresher, the First Amendment reads as follows: This is powerful stuff, there is a good reason the Founding Fathers made it the FIRST Amendment. It's also the reason why power-hungry elites are attacking it. These attacks are designed to control the way you think, speak, and believe, vote, what you read, and who holds your representatives responsible. The First Amendment is our strongest weapon against tyrants, and they know it. So what can you do about it? Hope that some wig in Washinton will eventually do something? We know how well that works. The best thing to do is to stay active, engage in the issues you care about, and exercise your rights.  So where to start? Here are a few things YOU can do to protect your First Amendment rights:                                Religion                                   The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is toyou guessed itpractice your faith. Become an active member in your place of worship, go to scripture studies, invite your friends to that late afternoon event, and walk the life. This can impact the way you spend money as well. Shop the businesses and brands that share your values, and don't shop at the ones that scorn them. Keeping the community alive and healthy is the best way to ensure that generations to come will be able to experience the freedom you enjoy.                              Speech                                   Much like religion, the best way to protect your freedom of speech is... to speak. Engage your friends and family in polite, civil conversation. Stand up for what you believe in, and make your case to your peers. Just remember to keep it friendly. No one ever won an argument by shouting down their opponent. The civil exchange of ideas is the cornerstone of our republic, and a dialogue where the participants are well-informed, considerate, compassionate, and open-minded can have permanent impacts on all involved.                              Press                                   Freedom of the Press seems a little tricky at first. Unless you work for the media, what are you supposed to do? Quit your job and go work for the local newspaper? The good news is that exercising this right is not nearly that difficult. In fact, you are currently doing it. The best thing you can do is to read from outlets that produce informative content. Want to know what Glenn consumes to stay informed every day?

Assembly                                    Anna Moneymaker / Staff | Getty ImagesFreedom of assembly is one of the more impactful yet underutilized freedoms in the First Amendment. Peaceably assembling and protesting with like-minded individuals can hugely influence politicians and policies while simultaneously creating community and fellowship between attendees. It's understandable why more people don't turn out. We're all busy people with busy schedules, and flying out to D.C. for the weekend seems like a daunting task to many. Thankfully, you don't have to go out all the way to D.C. to make a difference. Gather some like-minded people in your town and bring awareness to issues that impact your community. Big change starts locally, and exercising your freedom to assemble can be the catalyst to lasting impact.                               Petition                                   If you've been a long-time listener of Glenn, then you will have heard a few of his calls to action where he asks his audience to contact their representatives about a particular piece of policy. There is a good reason Glenn keeps on doing those: they work. Whether it's your local mayor or your senator, a call and an email go a long way. If you really want to make a change, convince your friends and family to reach out as well. The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is to??you guessed it??practice your faith.

Keeping the community alive and healthy is the best way to ensure that generations to come will be able to experience the freedom you enjoy.

BECKNews_45,"Writer   	This is big.   	Like, tectonic shift big.  The leak of the draft opinion by Justice Alito on Roe v. Wade is big enough to be the Watergate scandal of our era, let alone the ramifications of what it could mean for the unborn.   	The modern pro-life movement has never had the momentum it does today and we cannot afford to let this divine intervention pass us by.   	The time for slogans and platitudes has passed and good men and women of faith need to take courage and not shrink in the face of the monumental work ahead. The road ahead is long and the work is hard but if we rise to this challenge and are victorious, the blessings bestowed by our Creator will be more powerful than anything we can imagine.   	The odds were not in our favor that this day would ever come, especially in the face of the dominatingSpirit of the Age  but the opportunity is here and we must seize the reigns and never look back.   	We are all granted the gift of life, blessed with liberty, and given the opportunity to pursue happiness  all bestowed by a loving God who created us. As believers, we are charged with multiplying and replenishing the Earth, protecting the life we help cultivate and produce, and to fight to preserve the God-given rights of all.     	The Declaration of Independence clearly spells out these rights and the truths are plain and simple. It seems straightforward in its messaging and language but its still waters run deep and are anything but simple. Like the United States Constitution, it was penned by mere mortals, yet they were mortals who were divinely inspired by God. This divine inspiration is the key that unlocked the miracle of America and is vital to its continued survival.   	So how are we doing in all facets of our charge and stewardship?   	Think of all the restrictions imposed on us over the past couple of years. We couldnt do much of anything for a while without wearing a mask or proof of vaccination. Has providing for your family faced any challenges or roadblocks as of late with rising inflation and shortages? Or  heaven forbid  have you lost your job or had your hours reduced?   	Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness have all been on lockdown thanks to politicians who just couldnt let a good crisis go to waste. But did we do our part to fight them or did we sit back silently while muttering under our breath and doing little else?   	If you are like me, you probably could have done better. But, our failures in protecting these rights pale in comparison to the epic failure in our efforts to protect and preserve the life of the unborn for nearly five decades.   	Forget abolishing the Fed or I.C.E. or defunding the police, its time God-fearing Americans took a stand and demanded the defunding of Planned Parenthood and ABOLISH ABORTION  once and for all!   	Overturning Roe v. Wade would be a win beyond description but even if it does indeed happen ?? we still have a lot more to accomplish. This would completely remove the federal government from the process (which feels so freaking good to say!) but it does NOT eliminate the majority of abortions. It merely passes jurisdiction on to the states where they can decide. Federalism and decentr""ization are the answer for so much of what ails us and they are amazing  if not underutilized  tools that we must incorporate at any opportunity.   	Letting the states govern themselves with the ability to decide their own abortion legislation is an excellent if not surprising first step. Those are the judicial and legislative aspects of a very moral problem. Just because it's the state government and not the feds doesn't mean that the moral problem has been solved. With the bureaucratic red tape sorted, let's dig into the morality of the issue.   	While there are some instances where the death of the fetus is inevitable, abortion is NOT. To be clear, abortion is a wanton act of terminating a life, regardless of the reason. In the extremely rare event of the pregnancy putting the life of the mother at risk, of course, you prioritize her life above all else. The termination of a pregnancy may be necessary for some instances but the intentional act of killing a viable fetus, for the most part, is not.   	We MUST NOT let the Left continue to define the argument and control the language any longer. We have been playing their game on their terms, by their rules, for far too long. Finding a way to put the genie back in the b""ttle will be hard enough but trying to do it with their ever-changing word games is darn-near impossible. In order to flip the script in this debate, we must become the people God put us on this planet to be. But the key is making the changes a part of us, not just as a manipulative tool to get what we want.   	This may sound counterintuitive but bear with me for a moment. It's time to throw winning and losing out the window along with all the tactics that have failed completely. We cannot change people??s hearts and minds if all we are trying to do is change the scoreboard. This issue is about people, love, and compassion ?? and loving someone doesn't include keeping score.   	We will all be held to account for what we've made of the life granted to us by our Creator, but we are never meant to be the judge of another. I can??t imagine what it would feel like to be a pregnant 14-year-old girl who just found out she was ??punished with a baby""ou can??t fault her for being completely terrified and at least considering ALL of her options ?? abortion included.   	We must FORGIVE those who have chosen to abort. It's not only the compassionate thing to do but also what is required of us as Christians. Forgiveness always edifies and uplifts all parties while allowing reconciliation to flourish.   	Find ways to show LOVE to those who have already made this choice as well as those who are now facing this gut-wrenching decision. However, this must be authentic, with genuine love and concern, or it will be exposed for all to see.  STRENGTHEN those who are in this situation and EDUCATE them on all the options available. This is a huge part of the solution. So many times the choice seems so black and white, either it will ""in your life"" or ""abort"". But there are so many other options available and knowing these are key.   	We must TAKE A STAND and refuse to let the forces of darkness win. Refuse to give in and help people shake the apathy from their slumbering eyes. If you feel this call, I urge you to follow through and become the Fredrick Douglas or Harriet Tubman figure within your sphere of influence and help abolish this plague once and for all.   	Always remember, hate and love are not opposites. The two emotions are quite intense but they operate on the same spectrum, while the enemy of both is apathy. Sparking the passion for the cause of life is contagious and has the potential to spread like a wildfire. It can breathe life into a stagnant soul. If we stoke the flames and feed the fires of righteousness, theres no telling what good can be accomplished and who will join us.   	Politically the focus needs to be on waking the sleeping masses. Believe it or not, the Left and the abortion racket do not have public opinion in their favor. By and large, people tolerate abortion up to a point, but very few fully embrace the choice. In fact, a lot of those who support abortion do so with conditions attached. Also, a large number of women who have had abortions deeply regret it at some point.   	The Left has owned this debate for the past 30 years and now is the time we take it back. Up until now, the possibility of reversing this abhorrent ruling has been a pipedream and many conservatives in Congress have relegated their passion for the subject to the back burner and have backed down at every turn.   	But change is in the air.   	Abolishing abortion altogether is a huge undertaking, make no mistake about it  but making these changes helps us become a people worthy of Gods divine providence and intervention. With the current shift in the political winds providing some much-needed momentum, we are about to see miracles unfold the likes of which the world has never seen!   	Today, I call on all those who hold life sacred ?? on either side of the aisle ?? to join with me in this fight. Do not shrink in the face of history. Step up to the plate and fulfill your divinely appointed charge.   	We may have wilted in the intense heat of this fight up until now, but let today be the day that we forge a battalion of abortion abolitionists and affirm and protect the lives of our most vulnerable!   	Take courage and remember that God put you on this Earth at this time for a purpose and you have everything within you to accomplish what He expects from you.   	Is today the day abortion finally goes by the wayside? There's only one way to know for sure: let's mess around and find out.  WRITER  Texas is under threat of a George Soros-backed takeover. Soros-funded RINO judges have been elected in some of the highest court""n Texas. These judges implemented restrictions that have blocked nearly a thousand cases of voter fraud from being investigated or prosecuted from across the state. These new restrictions are similar to ones in place in states like George, Arizona, and Wisconsin, leaving Texas more susceptible to election corruption than ever. If Texas falls to corruption, America will lose its largest bastion of conservative electoral power in the nation. Without Texas, Republicans WILL NOT be able to win national elections and liberal corruption will go unchecked across the country.  Fortunately, there is a way to stop this: YOU. If you live in Texas you have a chance to stand up against corruption and to fight back! Starting Tuesday, February 20th, early voting for the primaries begins, where three of these judges are up for election. Go out and vote. If the right people are voted in, there's a good chance the restrictions will be lifted and election fraud can once again be prosecuted.  But remember, you can't just go in and vote for anyone who has an ""R"" next to their name. Sorors knows that a registered Democrat would never stand a chance in Texas, so his lackeys register as Republicans and ride the little ""R"" right into office. So who do you vote for?  Fortunately, Glenn had Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on his show today and Ken gave us his list of judges that he vouches for. His list is as follows:    WRITER  Who is really banning books? For years now, Conservatives have been taking flak from the left for supposed ""book bans."" The left likes to compare these ""bans"" to Nazi book burnings, accusing the right of sweeping authoritarian decrees designed to suppress information. In reality, this is a movement largely motivated by parents, who want to remove inappropriate books from children's libraries.  But if you want to discuss authoritarian book bans, look no further than the White House. As Glenn recently covered, the Biden administration has been pressuring the world's largest bookseller, Amazon, into suppressing books they disagree with. On February 5th, 2024, Ohio Representative Jim Jordan released a slew of subpoenaed documents that exposed pressure placed on Amazon by the Biden Administration. The documents, which Jordan dubbed ""The Amazon Files"" after Elon Musk's ""The Twitter Files,"" revealed an email conversation between Andrew Slavitt, a former White House senior adviser, and Amazon employees. In these emails, Slavitt complained that the top search results for books on ""vaccines"" were ""concerning"" and then requested that Amazon intervene. Amazon initially refused, not out of some altruistic concern for the free exchange of information. They thought any action taken would be ""too visible"" and would further exasperate the ??Harry/Sally narrative,?? referring to the outrage that followed Amazon's removal of Ryan T. Anderson??s book When Harry Became Sally.  Despite this initial refusal, Amazon agreed to meet with the White House a few days later. The number one item on their agenda was""oving books from the website. An Amazon employee even admitted that the reason they even took this meeting was due to the pressure being placed on them by the Biden Administration.  What was the result of this meeting? Amazon caved. They began to implement ways of limiting the outreach of books that challenged the mainstream vaccine narrative and other books the White House might not like. The White House was caught red-handed pressuring the world's largest bookseller to restrict the sale of books they consider in opposition to their narrative, and they have the gall to accuse conservatives of information suppression. This is just ONE of many actions committed by the Biden Administration that are more characteristic of a dictator than a president. What can you do about it? Fortunately, you are not dependent on Amazon and its corrupted algorithm to help you find books. Every week right here on GlennBeck.com, we highlight books that Glenn is reading or talking about in our ""Glenn's Bookshelf"" series. Here you can find a wide selection of books free from Amazon's filters. Be sure to sign up for Glenn's newsletter to find out about new additions to ""Glenn's Bookshelf"" every week.    WRITER   The left-wing media's most recent tirade is accusing Trump of being a dictator. But, as Glenn said, ""Everything they're accusing us of, they're doing."" Since day one, the Biden administration has overstepped the bounds placed on the executive branch set by the Constitution. In Glenn's most recent TV Special, he examined ten times Biden acted like a dictator, NOT a president. Here are 10 of Biden's Dictator Moves, and click HERE to get ALL of the research that went into this week's Glenn TV special:     WRITER   Every day it seems Glenn covers another story revealing how people across the world at all levels of power DESPISE the fact that YOU have rights, and they are actively trying to curtail them. Recently, there has been a string of attacks against the rights outlined in the First Amendment: the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, the freedom of assembly, and the freedom to petition. As a refresher, the First Amendment reads as follows: This is powerful stuff, there is a good reason the Founding Fathers made it the FIRST Amendment. It's also the reason why power-hungry elites are attacking it. These attacks are designed to control the way you think, speak, and believe, vote, what you read, and who holds your representatives responsible. The First Amendment is our strongest weapon against tyrants, and they know it. So what can you do about it? Hope that some wig in Washinton will eventually do something? We know how well that works. The best thing to do is to stay active, engage in the issues you care about, and exercise your rights.  So where to start?

BECKNews_46," Is Fox News crumbling at the seams? Bill OReilly joins Glenn to discuss a lawsuit facing the network that could be crippling. Plus, they discuss a new hire at the network, and whether or not the network's loyal, conservative viewers are preparing to jump ship. Plus, why did Speaker McCarthy trust ONLY Tucker Carlson with hours of January 6th footage?     Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Bill O'Reilly is joining us now from BillO'Reilly.com. He does his no spin zone news every night. You can find it at BillO'Reilly.com.Bill, been a great week. We have a lot to talk about. But I want to remind you, that we ended last week, saying that we wanted to talk about the lawsuit that's going on, with Fox.That could be crippling to them. And I am hearing rumblings that that network is coming apart at the seams, on the inside. I don't know if that's true, but that's what I heard.BILL: Well, there's a lot of angst. There's no doubt about it. And the cross-examination of what dominion put out there is definitely necessary, if you want to form some kind of accurate portrayal of what happened.I know what happened.But I don't want to be in a position, and I don't think you do either. Because we both worked for FNC. You know, bad-mouthing former employers, I don't like that position. But I can tell you that, I do believe there are going to be big changes at that network. Not right away.But there's a guy named David Rhodes, very quietly that FNC hired. Did you pick that up?GLENN: Yeah. David Rhodes. And why don't you explain who David Rhodes is.BILL: Okay. Former CBS News, chief news guy.GLENN: And?BILL: And the brother of -- his brother --GLENN: Ben. Ben Rhodes.BILL: Worked with Obama. Yeah. So, you know, hiring this guy to do the job that he said he is going to do. That's not what he's coming in.So that's number one.And then number two, it's a different place than it was when you and I were there. No doubt about it.GLENN: Yeah. Big time.BILL: And I did a poll on BillO'Reilly.com has the dominion lawsuit change their opinion of Fox News. Eighty-five percent say no. Because they are hard-core conservative traditional people, and they have nowhere else to go.GLENN: Well, I will tell you this. I will tell you this.I have heard more and more people say, I just don't -- I don't trust it anymore.I don't -- you know, I don't watch it like I used to.They're not against Fox, but they're not like they used to be. Now, that's my audience, and our audiences are different, so.BILL: That's true, particularly the younger people, the demographic. February to February, down 33 percent, prime time. That's a disaster.GLENN: Yeah. Disaster.BILL: So the younger people, the average age of the Fox News viewer right now is about 70 years old.GLENN: What's really weird, Bill. I don't know if you thought about this. But we were the last of the big national names. I mean, that doesn't happen anymore.You're -- these platforms, like that, that have everybody from all walks of life, coming to that platform. That -- that kind of fame, that you had for so long, is -- is not happening anymore.BILL: The business plan now is to cater to the choir. And we had a defactor, independents and liberals, at a very high rate.They don't have that anymore. The final thing is that, you know, Tucker Carlson got a big break, and he's the most recognizable guy. You know, Hannah has been around forever. But everybody knows Sean.But she's basically -- he's not the highest rated show. The five, if you can believe it. That's your all-time slot.GLENN: I know. The time slot that never, ever, ever did anything. And now it's the strongest one.BILL: Yeah. It's a stronger show. Because they like the people there. The older folks who watch it. They like the personalities there.But next week, when he shows the January 6 tape, that was like given to him, by the Speaker of the House. That's a huge break for them. Huge break.GLENN: Yeah. I will tell you, I am a little disturbed by it. I'm glad he has it, and will be watching and everything else.But I'm a little disturbed that it was given to only one person. There are so many hours. The way these things usually get -- you get to the truth, quickly. Is when it's just dumped out and everyone can look through it.BILL: Yeah. I disagree a little bit with that. Because if you give it to the New York Times. They're not going to report accurately about it. Now, whether Carlson does or not, I don't know.But he will have to show you the tape. Now they can edit it. I know. And I'm not.Look I wish McCarthy had given it to me. Because then you would get a fair play. And you.I mean, we're not going to cut it, so that you're not getting a real picture of it. But if he gave it to everybody, then you would get this massive propaganda hit, that would just blow any of the factual part of the tape away.And McCarthy wants Fox news, to be in his corner.Okay? Any speaker of the House would want that. And that's why he did it.GLENN: You following the Scott Adams?BILL: Oh, yeah.GLENN: Tell me about it.BILL: Are you talking about the abortion guy?GLENN: Yeah. Scott -- no. Scott Adams. The guy -- well, we can talk about that too.Scott Adams, the cartoonist.Didn't follow it.BILL: You talking about Dilbert? GLENN: Yeah. BILL: Okay, yeah. Beck, I'm on everything. Yeah, I felt that, you know, I didn't think that was a smart move for him.(laughter)You know.GLENN: Yeah. That's -- well said. Well said. Here's my rule. And I will make a confession on the Glenn Beck Program today. I used to try to persuade people, to look at race in one way or another. All right?And I had a detente with Al Sharpton. He was on the Factor. I gave his organization $25,000, when they ran out of money for Thanksgiving, to give turkeys away to the people of Harlem. Nobody knows that, by the way.And I tried, as hard as I could try, to bring detente. And now, I don't do that any longer.GLENN: Yeah. I know.I'm the same way. Let's talk about the hearings that happened with Merrick Garland. Those were so satisfying. Except, is anything going to come of it?BILL: Well, it shows you that the Department of Justice in the United States is corrupt.GLENN: Yeah. We know that.BILL: Merrick Garland makes Jeff sessions look like Rambo. I mean, he is such a doddering weak character.This is the guy going up against the trucking cartels?GLENN: Yeah.BILL: I mean, this guy, when you ask a question, as simple and essential as why has it taken three years, to investigate Hunter Biden and we still don't know the status of the investigation?And the man is like. You know.It's -- now, Ray at least said, well, it's the fault of the DA in -- the attorney general of Delaware.GLENN: Uh-huh.BILL: Okay.But Garland is up there, and he didn't order any arrests when he could have. Remember, he's the boss, of -- of the Justice Department.You have videotape of people standing outside Kavanaugh and Robert's homes, protesting the abortion ruling.You have their faces. You know who they are, all right?And you let it go.GLENN: He said, that's because the marshals make that kind of decision.BILL: But they don't. That's not true.GLENN: I know.BILL: The prosecutorial calls made by the attorney general. All he had to do was order the marshals or the FBI to bring these people in. And he did not do it. Because the Biden administration told him not to do it.Because they want to curry favor with the pro-abortion crew.GLENN: So -- so, Bill, we had -- I mean, that testimony was incredible. And clearly, there were falsehoods told in it.BILL: Yeah.GLENN: The lady who was up for the national archivist role, she out and out lied under oath. And provable. And it was astounding, that testimony. Does -- would any of that -- do you remember the days when you wouldn't want to be called in front of Congress, because Congress has so much power, if they say you're lying or whatever, they can -- they can do whatever they want to you, pretty much?And there was some fear. You know, you have to be really careful. These people are openly lying under oath, and nothing is happening to them.BILL: Yeah. I mean, that started under Obama, with his attorney general on the fast and furious gun thing.GLENN: Right.BILL: And they said, look, you have to turn over all -- and he said, no. Not going to do it. Holder. And once Congress walked away from that, that was over.It was over.So now, you're right, the lawyers tell the people -- the government people, going in to testify in these committees, here's what you say, all right?And we can weasel you out of it, if they come at you. But they probably won't. So here's what you say. I mean, we never got anything from Lois Lerner. The IRS. Cincinnati person, who is persecuting the right-wing groups. Nothing. Nothing.GLENN: Nothing. Nothing. Nothing with Fauci. Fauci just -- the lies --BILL: Well, a little bit different. A little bit different.GLENN: In what way? In what way?BILL: Because Fauci will hide behind, that's my opinion, all right? It was my opinion that it didn't -- COVID didn't come out of that lab. It's my opinion. My opinion. Opinion. Opinion. Okay?That's what Fox is using against dominion. It's opinion, opinion, opinion. So Fauci is not -- but in a factual area, when you -- you have the attorney general of the United States, who sends and approves of 25 FBI agents, S.W.A.T. teams, kicking down the door of a pro-life personGLENN: Yeah.BILL: Arresting, prosecuting, then the person is found not guilty.GLENN: In an hour.BILL: Did you see any remorse?GLENN: No. None. None.BILL: No. He's an arrogant, dishonest. And he was almost the Supreme Court justice.GLENN: I know. I thought about that the whole time. Bill O'Reilly from BillO'Reilly.com. We'll talk to you next week, thank you so much. Bill O'Reilly, watch his No Spin News at BillO'Reilly.com.   The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy people on the left. The AOC's have taken over, places in the media.And places like this in New York.This is what it is thousand. So there's been one case. One. One in the entire seven years. Where they did this.Where they shut down a company, that had no obvious victims.The case was 1972.And it was a company, relatively small company, that was writing term papers, for college students. Okay.So I want to write my paper.GLENN: I want to break out in God bless America.STU: Capitalism is pretty impressive. Apparently, this didn't go over that well.What they said, there were no obvious victims here. The people bought the term papers. They didn't want to write them. They got the term papers. They said, they were defrauding the education system.GLENN: Which they were.STU: This is the one time. And it's a small tiny company. Let me give you the other times they've done this.Tell me if any of these sound like, hey, I have a good interest rate, on a loan I paid back.Number one, a breast cancer nonprofit was shut down a dozen years ago. For using nearly all its $9 million in donations to pay for director's salaries, perks, and other expenses, instead of funding free mammograms. Okay.So they told everyone, donate money for free. Mammograms. And they just took all the money for themselves.That's number one. Number two, a private equity timber.Faking big investment success, was closed down after stealing millions of dollars from thousands of investors.Okay?You can see.GLENN: Yeah. Got it. But on both of those so far, you have hundreds of thousands of people, you know, I'm sure. That gave -- they're all victims.They gave their money.STU: Yeah. And they didn't get the thing that they want.GLENN: They didn't get the thing they were promised. You have all these people going to the AG. Saying, hey, this is a real problem here. This has to stop. Not here.GLENN: Not here.STU: Another one. Mental health facility, shuttered for looting $4 million from public funds, while neglecting patients.GLENN: Okay. Kind of a big one.STU: Pretty clear",-6,-7,
BECKNews_47," We are on the verge of LOSING OUR REPUBLIC, Glenn says. And signs show that regular politics wont be enough to fix the gaping issues currently facing America. In this clip, Glenn runs through just the latest stories showing how the FBI, Department of Justice (DOJ), and others in D.C. expect ordinary Americans  like YOU  to sit down and shut up. The way FBI Director Christopher Wray handled recent questioning from Senator Hagerty is just one example. But Glenn is NOT willing to sit down and shut up, he says. So, whats the solution? Glenn will provide a constitutional one TONIGHT during his special, The Reckoning: Biden Crime Family, which airs Thursday, May 18th at 8:00pm ET on BlazeTV.com and blazetv .    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Wow. Stu, how are you?STU: I am great, Glenn. How about yourself?GLENN: Well, I'm a little, shall I say, fed up.STU: You are a little fed up. I've noticed that this week. GLENN: I am a little fed up. STU: It has been the theme of the week. GLENN: It has been. And it has been -- I don't know -- a long time coming. And I think we all are. And you have two choices when you're fed up, you can either go, oh, well. It doesn't matter. Or you can say, wow, is this really kind of important. We should find a way to make it stop.Because we're on the verge of losing our nation. I believe the constitutional republic, that we all think we live in, is already a thing of the past.But it can be saved, but I don't think through regular politics in Washington. I'm going to lay this out for you tonight.But I just want to ask you, if you are willing to accept the consequences, of things like this.Bill Hagerty, yesterday, he's a senator. He was grilling the FBI director. About a document, that Grassley and comber have said, we need for our investigation. We know you have it. Whistle-blowers have said, you have it.We need it. And you have until like 5 o'clock today, to produce it.Well, they didn't produce it. So when Ray gets up to testify in front of Congress, here's what happens. Senator Grassley and Chairman Comer subpoenaed an FBI document containing an allegation regarding a pay-to-play scheme between then vice president Biden and a foreign national, and your response was due just a little bit earlier today. My question is, has the FBI complied with the subpoena for this document?PAT: I believe we submitted a lengthy letter earlier today.VOICE: A letter? But not the document that is of the subject of the request.VOICE: I can't speak to the specific document. But we are committed to working collaboratively with both committees, but we also have to balance sources and methods and ongoing investigations. And we will continue to work through the accommodation process as has happened many times in the past.VOICE: Was there a plan to submit the document? Or will it be never submitted.VOICE: I would refer to the letter which is quite detailed. And kind of goes through a fair amount of discussion, about our proposed approach.VOICE: To addressing the document? I do want to confirm, the document does exist.VOICE: I -- I -- really can't get into the specifics.GLENN: No. He can't get into that.VOICE: I will tell you, we understand completely, the importance of congressional oversight.GLENN: Right. Really important.VOICE: I also understand very much, as I think you do, the importance of us protecting sources and methods for investigations.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah. That's why you can't answer anything about January 6th. How many people from the FBI were involved in that? How many -- did you really have 12, or was it ten people on -- in the plot to -- to, you know, kidnap and kill Gretchen Whitmer?Was it ten? We can't get into any of that.Oh, gosh darn it. I'm sorry. Am I going to foul up your really, really competent system there?You know that Durham, his scope included the FBI investigations directed at the Hillary Clinton campaign. Did you know that?The FBI had three concurrent investigations, into the Clinton foundation. Yeah.FBI has -- you know, I wonder, is that why they shut it down after she lost?Is that why, it just went away? Nobody. Contributions went to zero. Because I thought it was just about the bribery.But was it possibly that you had a government agency going, there's a problem here. You've got foreign money, funneling in.And the FBI had that tip. The tip that was -- that a foreign government, in fact, three of them, a foreign government was sending a person to contribute to Clinton's anticipated presidential campaign, in a way to gain influence, with Clinton, should she win the presidency.So it's kind of like what they said, was happening with Russia. And Trump.But it was Clinton. And the FBI, somehow, you know, they -- they had all of this information.And then they lost it. They don't have a copy anymore. Of the illegal payment.And the FBI handlers couldn't explain why this illegal contribution wasn't documented in FBI records. It should have been there. It was a human error, I think. And we could all understand that.So, by the way, the FBI the agent handling it, was told the other agency that, you know, was saying, hey, here's some documents.They were told that you should stay away from all events relating to the Clinton campaign.So -- so that's -- that's good. I don't know about you.I think this is fair and honest.That I think we're not -- we're not looking at a giant cabal. Certainly, not a secret one.They're out in the open. They're absolutely out in the open.And they're doing a bang-up job. I don't know if you heard this. Let me give you a quick update. You remember the Zodiac Killer?STU: Yeah, big story.GLENN: Yeah. Back in the day. I think I was like four. STU: Made movies out of it. And everything.GLENN: Yes. Yes. Apparently, the FBI had the DNA evidence and everything, since 2012, I think. Yeah, 2012.Felon has been secretly listed the Zodiac suspect in headquarter computer since 2016, with partial DNA safely secured at Quantico. Unfortunately, they -- they didn't do anything about it.They were like, we're busy, on other things. We've got other things we got to do.And so they did those things. Now the Zodiac Killer is now dead.STU: So they got him. Good job, FBI.GLENN: Well, God got him, really. Eventually. Eventually.Now, something else that you should probably -- I mean, I'm just saying. I'm a little fed up.I think it's so clearly obvious what's going on. And we lose the republic, if we all go, well, what are you going to do. Right?If we all say, well, what are you going to do? That's just Washington. What happens?Why do you think they're trying to scare you, like they are?Why do you think, that they are taking these whistle-blowers. Wait until I tell you about the whistle-blowers.Wait until you see what they're doing to them. Why do you think they're doing that?Because they're telling every FBI agent, you stay in place.They're telling every IRS agent. You sit down, and shut up.They are making these people's lives miserable, and it's dangerous. Why do you think they're going after pro-abortion people?Sit down, shut up.Why do you think they targeted parents at the school boards?Sit down and shut up.So my question is: When somebody is saying that to America, do Americans today, continue to sit town and shut up?Because I know how that movie ends.I'm not going to sit down and shut up.I haven't a clue on how we're going to solve this.Well, you know what, something happened the last couple of months. We all looked at each other, and went, hey, that gives me an idea.And it's a constitutional stick. I don't look to guns or violence, or anything else for the answer. I look to the Constitution. Because they got it.They covered all of it. So how can we solve this?Because the Justice Department is not going to throw anybody in jail. The FBI is completely corrupt.We know that the Democratic Party. I mean, think of this.If your democratic friends. If they are paying any attention at all, the crimes here are so clear, and I don't even mean the crimes -- I can't tell you -- I can guess, but I can't tell you about the Clinton Foundation. I don't have evidence. But I believe that the FBI has had the evidence, and done nothing about it.It's so clear, when what you lose the presidency, and all of a sudden, nobody is giving to your foundation anymore?Hello! It's so clear what that is.However, you know, you need an investigation. In a court of law. But that's never going to happen.And even if it does happen, it's going to happen in Washington, DC, where 97 percent -- I mean, it's honestly. It's like Baghdad and Saddam Hussein: 97 percent of the people going to vote, are like, yeah. I'm for Saddam Hussein! Put my finger in the ink.So how do we win? How do we reclaim a blind justice?I'll tell you tonight. Blaze TV. If you're not a member of Blaze TV, you need to be.We need your support. Look, anybody telling you the truth. And this includes you. And that's why we try to be there for you. Anyone who is telling you the truth, and if we go to involved in this. It's about to go Jason Bourne.I worry about these whistle-blowers. This is dangerous stuff now in America.But the good guys win. We win. We just have to stay together and stand together. So join us at the Blaze. Tonight at 8:00 p.m.We're going to show you all of this. And we're going to go over it female I have a website, that I will introduce to you tonight. I will show you the whole plan. I ask you, bring friends over. Bring neighbors over. Bring anybody who has an open mind, to listen. Who wants to solve the problem.Because it will take all hands on deck. That's tonight 8 o'clock, Blaze TV. Join us. Use the promo code fed up, for your subscription. And you will save 30 bucks.   The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy people on the left. The AOC's have taken over, places in the media.And places like this in New York.This is what it is thousand. So there's been one case. One. One in the entire seven years. Where they did this.Where they shut down a company, that had no obvious victims.The case was 1972.And it was a company, relatively small company, that was writing term papers, for college students. Okay.So I want to write my paper.GLENN: I want to break out in God bless America.STU: Capitalism is pretty impressive. Apparently, this didn't go over that well.What they said, there were no obvious victims here. The people bought the term papers. They didn't want to write them. They got the term papers. They said, they were defrauding the education system.GLENN: Which they were.STU: This is the one time. And it's a small tiny company. Let me give you the other times they've done this.Tell me if any of these sound like, hey, I have a good interest rate, on a loan I paid back.Number one, a breast cancer nonprofit was shut down a dozen years ago. For using nearly all its $9 million in donations to pay for director's salaries, perks, and other expenses, instead of funding free mammograms. Okay.So they told everyone, donate money for free. Mammograms. And they just took all the money for themselves.That's number one. Number two, a private equity timber.Faking big investment success, was closed down after stealing millions of dollars from thousands of investors.Okay?You can see.GLENN: Yeah. Got it. But on both of those so far, you have hundreds of thousands of people, you know, I'm sure. That gave -- they're all victims.They gave their money.STU: Yeah. And they didn't get the thing that they want.GLENN: They didn't get the thing they were promised. You have all these people going to the AG. Saying, hey, this is a real problem here. This has to stop. Not here.GLENN: Not here.STU: Another one. Mental health facility, shuttered for looting $4 million from public funds, while neglecting patients.GLENN: Okay. Kind of a big one.STU: Pretty clear",-5,-5,
BECKNews_48," A recent shopping trip with his wife made Glenn LOSE MY MIND, he says. The store at fault? TARGET. The giant retailer officially has gone TOO FAR with its LGBT products to celebrate pride month this June. In fact, its enough to make Glenn BOYCOTT the store and in this clip, he explains why YOU should too. Because this year, Targets pride collection goes beyond rainbow onesies for babies or even swimsuits with a tuck friendly' option for the transgender Americans among us. This time, the store even hired a possible SATANIST to design some of the pride products for sale. Glenn gives all the details in this clip&    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: It is becoming sincerely a deep mental illness.PAT: Yeah.GLENN: A mental illness.What -- I'm sorry, but I was -- I went to Target on Friday.And I'm just -- you know -- we're just going to buy bananas.And then I go by the swimsuit area.Are the bananas here?Because it sure looks like there are lots of bananas in the women's swimsuit section.And it's not the women's swimsuit section. They look like women's swimsuits. But they're not.They are for trans people.Now, let's not be stupid. Trans people have been with us for a long time.In one auction, I so regret that I just didn't go an extra bid. I was bidding on a letter from the 1880s.And it was from a fort someplace out West in the middle of nowhere.And it was a letter to somebody back home. And they said, you know, Mrs. Waffleheimer, or whatever her name was. Mrs. Waffleheimer guide. And she was our cook. And she was the greatest cook ever. And we miss her so much.We were surprised, however, when we found her dead body.We were surprised as we were putting her in her coffin, to see that basically she had junk downstairs.She was a dude! The whole time. So this is not something new. It's been around.I have no problem with trans people. If that's what you want to do. But it is a very small percentage less than 1 percent of the population.Let me say it again.Less than 1 percent!And you would think we are a country made up of trans people.And I have to tell you, when you have bathing suits for kids, with the tuck it option, you've got a problem as a nation.I mean, a real problem as a nation. And I would suggest we stop it, right now. You -- I have said to you before, the greatest advice anyone can give you, is live not by lies.Do not live, endorse, or associate, with anyone who is telling lies.And right now, our entire society is lying. Remove yours from that. When I was walking down the aisles of -- I mean, I about lost my mind.Walking down the aisles of Target.And I saw all of this -- all of this trans stuff. And rainbows everywhere. And I was like, can we please, for the love of Pete, have some balance in our lives?Now, let me give you the story today, that I think, hopefully, will awaken some people. I mean, I'm wide awake.I hope my wife is wide awake.I hope this will awaken people, and say, okay. No more Target.No more Target.But I will tell you, I spent the whole weekend here in the studio. Recording my new book, future -- Dark Future.And it's 500 pages. So over two days and 12 hours, I only made it through half of the book.But it is really, really good. It's going to come out here in about a four weeks. You'll be able to get it, get it now. Get the audiobook.And please, and you'll understand why when you read it. Get the hardbound copy as well.Don't just get it digitally.These books will go away, soon, soon, if we really go much further. Anyway, in this book, you will find how deeply in bed Walmart is, with the WEF.I mean, they are neck deep. With the World Economic Forum, and ESG. And all of that stuff.So you're losing Walmart. And you're losing Target.But it's high time we lose them, if that's the side they want to be on.Now, what side is that?They'll say, they're just being open. They're being inclusive.I want you to listen to this story. Target is already facing boycotts for selling tuck-friendly bathing suits. And LGBTQ onesies for babies. Now it's been revealed that Target is selling LGBTQ pride products from a designer that appears to promote violence, drug use, and Satanism. Target sells three items by the brand Adprellen. We belong everywhere messenger bags. Too queer for here messenger bag. Pure transphobia, not trans people T-shirts. LGBTQ items are available at the Target website and in its stores. Target describes all of the products as all items were designed for all bodies regardless of gender identity and presentation.Just, I want you just to hear this. Remember that the goal of Black Lives Matter. Stated on their page. Until they removed it. Because everybody went, what?Is to destroy families. The biggest thing in the global warming moving, is to destroy families, by telling people, don't have children!And?Who else wants to destroy families and childrens?Satan.That's who. Okay.We added design features to help make the fit customizable for you.In other words, Target is saying, you can tuck your little wiener in. And wear a chick's bathing suit.That is -- that is not normal.How many are you selling, of those, Target?How many?I'm going to go -- I'm going to go, and making my last stop at Target.I am going and buying some of these things for the museum.Because some day, no one will believe that these were on the shelves of giant box stores. Like Target.Our hope is that the best -- our guests find clothing that makes them feel comfortable, and affirmed in their identity. You are either male or you're female.Period.Now, you can dress any way you want.But you are either male or female. Period.You go into a hospital.And you've got -- you're bleeding down stairs. And you say you're a woman. But you ain't a woman.The doctors will work on you, as a male. Not a female.He's going to look at your wiener, and say, that doesn't look like something you should be bleeding out of.Oh, my gosh.We understand that fit is incredibly important. Yeah. Target.Truth is more important.And we'll continue to evolve and improve on Fit needs for LGBTQISRNT.In the product descriptions, Target credits gay lesbian and straight education network. And they have a ten-year partnership with Gleeson. They lead the movement, according to Target, in creating affirming, accessible, and antiracist spaces.Now, how are you suddenly -- why is LGBTQI2+ -- why are they now claiming that they make things that are antiracist too?You could be homophobic. You could be transphobic. You could be Two Spirit phobic. That's the one -- I'm spooked by those Two Spirit people.But racism? Anyway, we're proud of ten years plus, celebration with the support of their mission. Blah, blah, blah.Now, you go to the website of the company, that they have partnered with, based in London.And you find that it was founded by a gay trans man. Great. The founder and designer is Eric Callen. And according to Trans Lash, a website that is building experiences to advance trans narratives. Histories, healings, and most importantly, the human rights of trans people. He started this company, and then he wrote about his contract with -- with Target.He said, and I quote, being able to sell my stuff in Target stores is incredibly exciting. Knowing that people are seeing it, without necessarily explicitly seeking LGBTQ-related stuff is wonderful. I'm especially happy about the fact that young, closeted people will see it. And I hope in some way, they will feel a little more comfortable in themselves, as we deserve to feel.You can get the sweatshirt and the bags on Target's website, or in stores.He goes on: These have already got the transphobes infuriated with me. And I feel like quite the celebrity, in that that they feel like this is all some big conspiracy. And that I have any power to brainwash anyone.I'm just some guy drawing pictures. Are you? Callen claims that the word groomer is a right-word transphobic word. Uh-huh. However, he also goes on to confess, that he was groomed when he was young. And he will likely be working through it, for the rest of his life. When I was in my very early teens, I was groomed and in an abusive relationship/friendship with the person ten years old than me. Uh-huh. However, his designs nearly all feature the colors of the trans gender flag, appear to promote violence, drug use, and Satanism. There are designs that seem to call for violence, including a pin with two axes that reads, fight for trans rights. There is a design with a guillotine, with skulls near it, that reads homophobic headrest. Now, imagine, if I made a T-shirt that had a guillotine and skulls and I said, liberal headrest.Do you think they would say, I was promoting violence?He sells a pin with a ball and chain flail weapon, that says, we bash back.The bay bashing. Lesbian bashing. Queer bashing.All far too prevalent in this world.And from the comments shouted on the streets, to the horrific violent crimes committed against LGBTQ+ people, sometimes there's only one language those who harass us understand.Some might say, turn the other cheek.But others would advise to bash them back. And if you're going to do that, why not do it with a heart-shaped pastel-colored mace.One design features a lighter with the words, burn down the cis-tem. Uh-huh.The cis-tem is what keeps trans kids from feeling free. This is what he's writing now on Instagram. Their true selves. It makes the world dangerous for them to live in. It causes people to feel guilty for transitioning. It aims to ensure that we stay in rigid boxes, set up at birth. It makes it harder for trans women to get jobs, housing, insurance.It tells nonbinary people, that they don't exist.It's the reason why trans women face both misogyny and transphobia in equal measure. It's becoming the cis-tem that trans men are erased and overlooked. Now, trans men and trans women, I'm not sure.We don't need to restructure it, he writes.We need to burn it down, and start up again in a system that doesn't police gender or expression. A world that allows exploration, changing our minds, dressing how we want to, taking up the space we need. Being treated as we deserve. We need to burn down the system, and create a world where trans people don't get to just live, but thrive!His account also encourages transgender people to bite turfs, which is trans exclusionary radical feminists. The design features a snake biting a hand of a human.And the caption reads, never trust a turf. They're not well-meaning. They just don't care about cis-women's rights. They don't have the right intentions. Avoid them when you can, and bite them when you can't.Another one -- other slogans that you will find from the designer of the Target clothing.Join my gay cult. Transitioning Saves Lives. Heteronormalivity.PAT: Yeah. HeteronormativityGLENN: Yeah, heteronormativity is a plague. Binding doesn't make you less of a man. And trans witches for abortion.So I think we're doing good.Hail trans demons. He also says. Oh, and one more T-shirt available.Satan respects pronouns.  Congratulations. Are you shopping at Target?I hope not.  The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy people on the left. The AOC's have taken over, places in the media.And places like this in New York.This is what it is thousand. So there's been one case. One. One in the entire seven years. Where they did this.Where they shut down a company, that had no obvious victims.The case was 1972.And it was a company, relatively small company, that was writing term papers, for college students. Okay.So I want to write my paper.GLENN: I want to break out in God bless America.STU: Capitalism is pretty impressive. Apparently, this didn't go over that well.What they said, there were no obvious victims here. The people bought the term papers. They didn't want to write them. They got the term papers. They said, they were defrauding the education system.GLENN: Which they were.STU: This is the one time. And it's a small tiny company. Let me give you the other times they've done this.Tell me if any of these sound like, hey, I have a good interest rate, on a loan I paid back.Number one, a breast cancer nonprofit was shut down a do",-10,-10,
BECKNews_49," America isnt currently in a battle against men  Republican or Democrat, Glenn says. Rather, our nation is in a battle against full-fledged evil. And in this clip, Glenn shares 2 stories that prove just how DARK our society has become. One of those stories includes an after school SATAN CLUB, run by the Satanic Temple. A federal judge just ruled the Saucon Valley School District (in Pennsylvania) MUST allow the club to run. Glenn gives all the details, plus, he describes a small, but powerful, action you can take TODAY to help stop this madness soon&     Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I truly believe, that if there is a God, his -- his work, his glory has got to be that he can save, man, his creation.And create a world, where if we understand what's going on, we'll be joyous.That we have joy in our life. We are meant to have joy.And I -- I have -- it's weird.About three weeks ago, or so, I was praying. And I heard. I need you here, every day for the next two weeks.And so I dedicated myself. I would come in and do the show. And then I would come in and pray.And I'm having a hard time seeing things -- this is exact opposite for me.I've tried to be positive for a very long time.And I couldn't. I'm like, oh, my gosh. The news of the day. And then I would get sidetracked. I'm having a hard time not talking you to about the good things. And I don't mean about the good things that are going on. Because those are a little sparse. I mean, just the things like, you are in control of your own life. You are in control of your own emotions. You are in control.You were born for a reason. You -- if you are -- if you are locked in this trap, where you were like, I'm a bad person. Or I've done all things. Or I can't be of use, because I'm too small. Whatever that is.That's all a lie. And I want you to know, that we are not -- we are not battling men or Democrats or Republicans.We are battling evil. Full-fledged evil.And what does evil do? Evil perverts everything.Evil twists all the words, to make you believe, it doesn't exist. And that it's actually kind of a good thing, you know.Listen to this story. The after-school Satan club, was brought by a parent who wanted a non-Christian religious club. That would be safe. And inclusive for their non-Christian children.So you go to the satanic temple? Okay.Judgment issue there, right off the bat. Hey, mom, I don't really think that's a good idea.The federal judge now has ruled that a Pennsylvania school district must allow an after school Satan club. They ruled in 1962, no state-sponsored prayer. Violation of the establishment. That's not true.Bring that up right now. I'll bet you that there are people that are looking for the case. If somebody has the balls to read the Bible, or say a prayer every day in a public school, and they make a good case for it.I'm telling you, that will get in front of the Supreme Court.And I think they would overturn this.But that was ruled in 1962. Have we gotten better? Or have we gotten worse?Okay. Now, because of free speech and all of this.You have to allow the worshiping of Satan. That's what they say. You don't. It's evil. No!So the school board in the Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania, now they say are obligated to allow the Satanist Club.Now, listen to this. Is this amazing. The Satanic Temple, which sponsors the after school Satan's Club likewise applied to use school facilities after being contacted by a local parent, who hoped to bring the reasonable. A non-Christian, religious club. That would be safe and inclusive for their non-Christian children. They went on to claim, that the programming undertaken in the name of Satan, was opened to all students.And it promotes the Satanic virtues of benevolence, empathy. Now think of this: Benevolence. Empathy. What are we talking about right now?What is in our society? Can you be a little more benevolent?Can't you help these people a little bit more?What? You have no empathy for what these people -- what these things have been going through.It's been twisted. There is a point to where you say, oh, my gosh. This is the 150th time you've stolen from CVS. And, boy, I feel bad. Because you had a really tough life. But you're going to jail! Okay? There can be empathy and love, but justice must be on the other side of the scale. Justice and mercy. So they went on to say. It promotes benevolence. Empathy. Critical thinking.Critical thinking.GLENN: This comes from the Dark Ages, where you're like, don't question. Don't even question.Well, I don't -- can we not even look into that?No. That's the devil making you want to do that. I haven't heard that, since I don't know when.Nobody even talks about that anymore. No. It's okay to question.Honest questions. But, you know, it's like you're going to the Mercedes dealership, and, you know, because you're going to church.There's the Mercedes. And you're like, okay.Now let me go to a -- the place that Biden is using now just -- it's all government money. It's completely corrupt.And let me talk to them, about why I should have an EV.They're really corrupt. They have the wrong things going. It's all a scam.Oh, I'm just going to listen, and ask my questions, at the Mercedes dealership. I may not buy a Mercedes.But tell me why this is the car I should have.And I would like to know some skeptics around. But they're not part of the corrupt EV company that's -- that's just dirty.Okay? What are we doing? You're asking questions and you're going to Satanists for answers? What kind of answers do you think you're going to get, Mom?Also, problem solving. Creative expression. Listen to this one. Personal sovereignty.Really? Satan was the one for personal sovereignty?Satan was the one who said, I'll rescue them all, because I'll tell them exactly what to do.And you think he's for personal sovereignty.Oh. And compassion. This is what is -- is happening now in our society. We are not battling people. People have fallen under some sort of hypnosis. Some sort of spell.I swear to you. I don't know what happened to them, to get them. I'm guessing it's just been a slow trip. And before you know it, you're like, yeah.The Satanist Club. That makes sense. No. It doesn't, sweetheart. It doesn't.I am your brother. I will always love you. But I'm going to tell you the hard truth.You are on the wrong path. And it's not like we're talking about tax policies. We're talking about evil.And I don't know how people don't see that right now. Listen to this one. This is actually from Newsweek. And it was written by Ashley McGuire.And she says, it's okay to be Roman Catholic, right? That was a question that Congressman Jeff Van Drew posed to an FBI official in recent investigative hearings run by Congressman Jim Jordan. Somebody has to answer me, please.You'll forgive him for asking the hearings, ignored almost entirely, save a handful of conservative news outlets, that were looking into the leaked FBI memo, alleging some sort of connection between radical traditionalist, Catholic ideology in the FBI's words and violent extremism.In its title of the memo, it states that racially or ethnically violent extremists in radical, traditional Catholic ideology, almost certainly presents new mitigation opportunities.Does that bother you?What does that mean? New mitigation opportunities?What does that mean? You're looking for crimes?You're out there -- you're not prosecuting crimes. You're looking for crimes. It discusses new avenues for tripwire and source development. Including through outreach through traditional Catholic parishes, and the development of sources.Meaning, get the local priest and parishioners, to spy on each other.So they say, oh, no.That was a mistake. Really? Was it?Because that was pretty amazing. And it went out to all of the FBI nationwide.Okay. Now, what's really bad is the Catholic Church is probably the one that is getting the most pushback on abortion. Just -- there's been 150 attacks on Catholic churches.The number -- the -- since they started tracking in 2020, the number now is over 300.There was 150 attacks, right after Roe vs. Wade.So now, this Catholic president, he's overseeing a Justice Department that is targeting the Roman Catholics, because they're extremists.Now, is that -- are you an extremist because you don't agree with the policy of the president?It is really -- it is -- let me say this: Today is the national day of prayer.Last year. Roughly 15 Christians were killed for their faith, every day.There were 2,110 churches that were attacked and destroyed.There were 140,000 Christians who were displaced only because of their faith. In North Korea, if they think you're a Christian, you get deported to a labor camp, or you're executed. If they find you with a Bible in Somalia, they'll kill you immediately. Christian converts in Yemen are targeted to their faith, abused, assaulted, raped, and killed. In Libya, Christians are routinely murdered by their own families. Nigeria, 41 Christians were massacred while worshiping in their church on Pentecost. The list goes on and on. Pakistan, Sudan, India, Afghanistan, China.According to Open Doors World Watch List, there are 50 countries where Christians face very high or extremely high persecution.But today, in America, is our National Day of Prayer. By law, our president is required to release a statement that sets this day aside for National Day of Prayer every year. Now, you might think -- you might be thinking, oh, that's a proclamation, just to save face. Our leaders don't actually believe in prayer.Yeah. That might be true. But just think about this. In America, we're worried that people might be pretending to be religious. In North Korea, and all around the world, they have to pretend not to be religious, or they die.This year, I want you to go into your office. I want you to go wherever -- wherever you have some friendlies around you. But it's a little bit risky. I want you to go in and say, hey. It's a national day of prayer.And I just we can all agree, I think our country is in trouble.I don't care what side we're on. We're in trouble. Can we take a minute and pray together? Do it. Do it.STU: That's what Tucker Carlson said. He came out. Never would do another show.GLENN: Yeah. Well, do it. It has to be done.Christians have to take a moment and think and pray and thank God that we still live in a country, where God can be welcomed and praised.   The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy people on the left. The AOC's have taken over, places in the media.And places like this in New York.This is what it is thousand. So there's been one case. One. One in the entire seven years. Where they did this.Where they shut down a company, that had no obvious victims.The case was 1972.And it was a company, relatively small company, that was writing term papers, for college students. Okay.So I want to write my paper.GLENN: I want to break out in God bless America.STU: Capitalism is pretty impressive. Apparently, this didn't go over that well.What they said, there were no obvious victims here. The people bought the term papers. They didn't want to write them. They got the term papers. They said, they were defrauding the education system.GLENN: Which they were.STU: This is the one time. And it's a small tiny company. Let me give you the other times they've done this.Tell me if any of these sound like, hey, I have a good interest rate, on a loan I paid back.Number one, a breast cancer nonprofit was shut down a dozen years ago. For using nearly all its $9 million in donations to pay for director's salaries, perks, and other expenses, instead of funding free mammograms. Okay.So they told everyone, donate money for free. Mammograms. And they just took all the money for themselves.That's number one. Number two, a private equity timber.Faking big investment success, was closed down after stealing millions of dollars from thousands of investors.Okay?You can see.GLENN: Yeah. Got it. But on both of those so far, you have hundreds of thousands of people, you know, I'm sure. That gave -- they're all victims.They gave their money.STU: Yeah. And they didn't get the thing that they want.GLENN: They didn't get the thing they were promised. You have all these people going to the AG. Saying, hey, this is a real problem here. This has to stop. Not here.GLENN: Not here.STU: Another one. Mental health facility, shuttered for looting $4 million from public funds, while neglecting patients.GLENN: Okay. Kind of a big one.STU: Pretty clear",-4,-4,
BECKNews_50," 79 years ago today, my grandfather jumped out of a plane. He was 17 years old when he joined the 101st Airborne Division, and at the ripe age of 18, he boarded a C-47 aircraft with the rest of his company destined for Normandy.  On June 6, 1944, he jumped out of that plane onto Utah Beach, becoming a part of what would become the largest amphibious invasion in military history, Operation Overlord, or, as it's more commonly known, D-Day.  Though only 18, my grandfather was one of the oldest soldiers in his company. He recounted how many, like himself, lied about their age in order to have their shot at fighting for their country. As Omaha Beach veteran Frank Devita recounted: And many of them did.  On June 6, 1944, almost 160,000 troops from the United States, the British Commonwealth, and their allies began what would become the ultimate demise of the Third Reich, concluding one of the darkest chapters in human history. 2,500 of these soldiers were American boys who gave the ultimate sacrifice in Normandy, where most of them remain, their bodies never making it back home to the country for which they paid the ultimate price.  Underwood Archives / Contributor | Getty Images In an age seemingly devoid of courage and virtue, it is natural to picture these soldiers as the greatest of men. And they were. However, we must remember these exemplars of manhood were boys, young boys, who exhibited the courage and virtue that we so seldom see in those twice their age today. Remembering D-Day is not only sobering regarding the loss of life and innocence; it's sobering to consider how far our country has strayed from the ideals exemplified by the ""greatest generation.""  79 years ago, Americans knew what they were fighting for. As a Jewish man born in Berlin, witnessing the rise of fascism and socialism at the expense of individual liberty and the sanctity of life, my grandfather was eager to go back to his birthplace as an American soldier to fight for the fundamental principles of life and liberty that he and his family had been denied in Nazi Germany.  They were some of the lucky individuals who were able to escapeand there's a reason why he and his family chose America as their new homeland. The life and liberty they had been denied in Germany were regarded as sacred in the United States.  Yet, do we still regard these things as sacred? JEAN-FRANCOIS MONIER / Contributor | Getty Images Most of the United States still hold that the sanctity of life is contingent upon convenience and circumstance. Economic policies continue to morph closer to the socialism adopted by the rest of the world in the 20th century, penalizing the success and merit that was once tantalizing to immigrants like my grandfather. Moreover, 2020 extinguished any doubt that the freedoms we hold dear are expendable at the whims of our ruling class.  This isn't the same America that provided refuge to my grandfather's family nor is it the same country that he and his brothers-in-arms fought for.  On this anniversary of D-Day, it is important that we remember the sacrifice given by the young American boys, who became the greatest of men, on the beaches of Normandy. However, perhaps it is just as important to remember that we are called to the very same standard as they so powerfully exemplified: to love our country and the principles of life and freedom that stand in stark contrast to much of the onlooking world and to have the courage to defend it, even if it requires the level courage that these young men were called to.     WRITER  Texas is under threat of a George Soros-backed takeover. Soros-funded RINO judges have been elected in some of the highest courts in Texas. These judges implemented restrictions that have blocked nearly a thousand cases of voter fraud from being investigated or prosecuted from across the state. These new restrictions are similar to ones in place in states like George, Arizona, and Wisconsin, leaving Texas more susceptible to election corruption than ever. If Texas falls to corruption, America will lose its largest bastion of conservative electoral power in the nation. Without Texas, Republicans WILL NOT be able""to win national elections and liberal corruption will go unchecked across the country.  Fortunately, there is a way to stop this: YOU. If you live in Texas you have a chance to stand up against corruption and to fight back! Starting Tuesday, February 20th, early voting for the primaries begins, where three of these judges are up for election. Go out and vote. If the right people are voted in, there's a good chance the restrictions will be lifted and election fraud can once again be prosecuted.  But remember, you can't just go in and vote for anyone who has an ""R"" next to their name. Sorors knows that a registered Democrat would never stand a chance in Texas, so his lackeys register as Republicans and ride the little ""R"" right into office. So who do you vote for?  Fortunately, Glenn had Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on his show today and Ken gave us his list of judges that he vouches for. His list is as follows:    WRITER  Who is really banning books? For years now, Conservatives have been taking flak from the left for supposed ""book bans."" The left likes to compare these ""bans"" to Nazi book burnings, accusing the right of sweeping authoritarian decrees designed to suppress information. In reality, this is a movement largely motivated by parents, who want to remove inappropriate books from children's libraries.  But if you want to discuss authoritarian book bans, look no further than the White House. As Glenn recently covered, the Biden administration has been pressuring the world's largest bookseller, Amazon, into suppressing books they disagree with. On February 5th, 2024, Ohio Representative Jim Jordan released a slew of subpoenaed documents that exposed pressure placed on Amazon by the Biden Administration. The documents, which Jordan dubbed ""The Amazon Files"" after Elon Musk's ""The Twitter Files,"" revealed an email conversation between Andrew Slavitt, a former White House senior adviser, and Amazon employees. In these emails, Slavitt complained that the top search results for books on ""vaccines"" were ""concerning"" and then requested that Amazon intervene. Amazon initially refused, not out of some altruistic concern for the free exchange of information. They thought any action taken would be ""too visible"" and would further exasperate the ??Harry/Sally narrative,?? referring to the outrage that followed Amazon's removal of Ryan T. Anderson??s book When Harry Became Sally.  Despite this initial refusal, Amazon agreed to meet with the White House a few days later. The number one item on their agenda was""oving books from the website. An Amazon employee even admitted that the reason they even took this meeting was due to the pressure being placed on them by the Biden Administration.  What was the result of this meeting? Amazon caved. They began to implement ways of limiting the outreach of books that challenged the mainstream vaccine narrative and other books the White House might not like. The White House was caught red-handed pressuring the world's largest bookseller to restrict the sale of books they consider in opposition to their narrative, and they have the gall to accuse conservatives of information suppression. This is just ONE of many actions committed by the Biden Administration that are more characteristic of a dictator than a president. What can you do about it? Fortunately, you are not dependent on Amazon and its corrupted algorithm to help you find books. Every week right here on GlennBeck.com, we highlight books that Glenn is reading or talking about in our ""Glenn's Bookshelf"" series. Here you can find a wide selection of books free from Amazon's filters. Be sure to sign up for Glenn's newsletter to find out about new additions to ""Glenn's Bookshelf"" every week.    WRITER   The left-wing media's most recent tirade is accusing Trump of being a dictator. But, as Glenn said, ""Everything they're accusing us of, they're doing."" Since day one, the Biden administration has overstepped the bounds placed on the executive branch set by the Constitution. In Glenn's most recent TV Special, he examined ten times Biden acted like a dictator, NOT a president. Here are 10 of Biden's Dictator Moves, and click HERE to get ALL of the research that went into this week's Glenn TV special:     WRITER   Every day it seems Glenn covers another story revealing how people across the world at all levels of power DESPISE the fact that YOU have rights, and they are actively trying to curtail them. Recently, there has been a string of attacks against the rights outlined in the First Amendment: the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, the freedom of assembly, and the freedom to petition. As a refresher, the First Amendment reads as follows: This is powerful stuff, there is a good reason the Founding Fathers made it the FIRST Amendment. It's also the reason why power-hungry elites are attacking it. These attacks are designed to control the way you think, speak, and believe, vote, what you read, and who holds your representatives responsible. The First Amendment is our strongest weapon against tyrants, and they know it. So what can you do about it? Hope that some wig in Washinton will eventually do something? We know how well that works. The best thing to do is to stay active, engage in the issues you care about, and exercise your rights.  So where to start? Here are a few things YOU can do to protect your First Amendment rights:                                Religion                                   The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is toyou guessed itpractice your faith. Become an active member in your place of worship, go to scripture studies, invite your friends to that late afternoon event, and walk the life. This can impact the way you spend money as well. Shop the businesses and brands that share your values, and don't shop at the ones that scorn them. Keeping the community alive and healthy is the best way to ensure that generations to come will be able to experience the freedom you enjoy.                              Speech                                   Much like religion, the best way to protect your freedom of speech is... to speak. Engage your friends and family in polite, civil conversation. Stand up for what you believe in, and make your case to your peers. Just remember to keep it friendly. No one ever won an argument by shouting down their opponent. The civil exchange of ideas is the cornerstone of our republic, and a dialogue where the participants are well-informed, considerate, compassionate, and open-minded can have permanent impacts on all involved.                              Press                                   Freedom of the Press seems a little tricky at first. Unless you work for the media, what are you supposed to do? Quit your job and go work for the local newspaper? The good news is that exercising this right is not nearly that difficult. In fact, you are currently doing it. The best thing you can do is to read from outlets that produce informative content. Want to know what Glenn consumes to stay informed every day?

Assembly                                    Anna Moneymaker / Staff | Getty ImagesFreedom of assembly is one of the more impactful yet underutilized freedoms in the First Amendment. Peaceably assembling and protesting with like-minded individuals can hugely influence politicians and policies while simultaneously creating community and fellowship between attendees. It's understandable why more people don't turn out. We're all busy people with busy schedules, and flying out to D.C. for the weekend seems like a daunting task to many. Thankfully, you don't have to go out all the way to D.C. to make a difference. Gather some like-minded people in your town and bring awareness to issues that impact your community. Big change starts locally, and exercising your freedom to assemble can be the catalyst to lasting impact.                               Petition                                   If you've been a long-time listener of Glenn, then you will have heard a few of his calls to action where he asks his audience to contact their representatives about a particular piece of policy. There is a good reason Glenn keeps on doing those: they work. Whether it's your local mayor or your senator, a call and an email go a long way. If you really want to make a change, convince your friends and family to reach out as well. The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is to??you guessed it??practice your faith. Become an active member in your place of worship, go to scripture studies, invite your friends to that late afternoon event, and walk the life. This can impact the way you spend money as well.

BECKNews_52," Another gun-related tragedy hit America over the weekend, this time outside a mall in Allen, Texas. And, unsurprisingly, the reaction from politicians and media pundits turned political almost immediately. In fact, despite not presenting evidence to the public, some are now reporting the killer was a white supremacist. But can we trust what the government and the media tell us? And if the gun is to blame me for this shooting, then what about the car that took just as many lives in Brownsville? And why is the media already releasing information about the Allen, TX shooter, but we still know very little about the ones in Las Vegas and Nashville? Glenn and Stu discuss all this, plus more&     Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: So we're looking at quite an interesting weekend just here in Texas. We had a shooter. STU: Pretty close to here. About half an hour or so. Just a mall outlet everywhere. Now, I've been to every mall outlet area in Texas, I think. So this is not to be notable, but I have been to this place where this occurred before. And it was just like your typical outdoor giant mall. Has over hundred stores in it. It's really an outdoor mall, has over 100 stores. And someone decided to pull up in all black, and just start taking people out. Thankfully, there was a police officer nearby at an unrelated call, and came over and ended it relatively quickly. But still, a devastating day, and a scary day. There was a mall nearby here, that had basically something else happen. And everybody is freaked out. Because everyone is on edge. So they evacuated another separate mall. Turned out to be nothing. But that's the sort of feeling now, that people have. And look, it's scary. It is. It's really, really difficult to stop though. Really, really difficult to stop.GLENN: Well, we know he had mental issues. So he probably should have been on medication or, you know, institutionalized.STU: Yeah.GLENN: But, of course, it's the gun. It's always the gun. Well, no. Also, it was the car this weekend. We had eight people killed, nine people injured after somebody takes their car and ran into a migrant shelter in Brownsville, Texas.STU: Yeah. It's interesting. That one is still being reported both ways. It may have been an accident. It also may have been a drunk driver, they think.GLENN: It also may have been gang-related. Gang-related. So we don't know what that one is.STU: It may have been intentional.GLENN: So far, we don't think that it is white supremacy. It was either a drunk driver, gang-related, accident.STU: They're trying to say the shooting was white supremacy, though.GLENN: Yeah. Except the guy was Hispanic. And I'm trying to wrap my arms around this. In fact, I got this from the Daily Beast. Okay. This from the Daily Beast, in 2021. Okay?STU: Okay.GLENN: Blah, blah, blah. The FBI began monitoring a Facebook chat group, in 2019 called right-wing death squad, because of violent rhetoric.STU: Wait. There's violent rhetoric, in the group of right-wing death squad.GLENN: Yeah, I know it's hard to believe.STU: You can't trust anybody these days.GLENN: One of the quotes. I have access to 300,000 pounds of ammonia. I just need a container to store it in.GLENN: That might be --STU: If you don't have -- where is it? If you don't have a container to -- I'm just carrying it around my pocket.GLENN: I don't know. I don't know.This is one of the courts we could lift from the court documents. That is not the filled with expletives from African-Americans. With one of the men from Arkansas. With the current state of the world, they have become severe pests.They must be eradicated completely and utterly.Racism isn't real, whites are the only humans. This guy who was in trial, he was a guy who wanted to be Timothy McVeigh. Similar sentiments were expressed in the group with hateful messages about Jewish and Hispanic people. So there seems to be a problem with this particular group. With all people except apparently white people.STU: You're saying, there's a problem with the group, white wing death squad.GLENN: Yeah. It's weird, isn't it? It's weird. It's weird. It's weird.So they want to clean up the white community. And we need a new world tomorrow. And the S-word for Hispanics. And the N-word for blacks, need to hang from trees, end quote.STU: This wasn't the person you're talking about?GLENN: No. This is the -- this is the article about this group, when another guy was arrested in 2020. Okay?So he was arrested. Daily Beast, wanted everybody to know. This white guy was after Hispanics. And blacks and Jews. And anyone of any color whatsoever. Now --STU: Uh-oh.GLENN: Now you can be Hispanic and a member of this group. So I don't know if they expanded their membership.STU: Maybe they took the Daily Beast criticism seriously at right-wing death squad. And, you know, we're not as open as we should be.Look, we should just be accepting right-wingers who want to cause death.GLENN: Yes. Yes. Amen.STU: And why do we care about the color of the skin? Bringing people together.GLENN: So ridiculous.STU: It is so ridiculous. And I think too, you mentioned this many times, Glenn. Racism is a human problem. It's not a white problem.And there's this thing in the media, that they like to do. And act as if other races, other than white people, as if they don't hate other races other than white people.You know, there's a lot of tension between the Asian and black communities in certain cities, for example. There's a lot of this that goes on.Hispanics and blacks have their own issues separate from white supremacy.But because the media has no prism to look at this, other than blaming white-wing extremists and white supremacists every single time. They run into these cross the streams moments, where their coverage makes no sense. You know, look, it's possible for Hispanic people to dislike black people too. It's wrong. Just like it's wrong for white people to do it. You shouldn't make any decision based on the color of someone's skin. That's just stupid.Unless of course if you're looking for affirmative action, then of course it's completely okay. Or if it's, you know -- if it's Ibrahim Kennedy. And anti-racism. Then all your decisions can be made on skin color. But other than that, you should make decisions based on skin color, Glenn. And that's something that we stood by. I stood by that principle the entire time here. I know it's changed. I know the trendy thing, is to do the opposite.GLENN: Yeah. My whole life is, don't judge people by the color of their skin. But by the content of their character. Which doesn't seem to be real popular. But I still stand by it too, Stu.Now, let me just throw this question out: Do you believe the government and the media?When the media comes out and says, we've scrubbed the internet, so you can't see any of it.And then they come out and say, this Hispanic man just loves to be part of this white power group.STU: It's hard to trust anything they're saying.GLENN: Correct.STU: Especially when they don't give us the evidence.GLENN: Yes. Yes. And it's strange too that so far, they have a really good batting average on white supremacists.But they can't find anybody who is bombing a church.They -- or an abortion clinic.Because, quote, it happens at night.STU: Uh-huh. It's dark.GLENN: Love that. It's very dark. Can't see. Sometimes they wear black.Now, they can't seem to find that. They can't find the Supreme Court leaker can't find that group.STU: Oh, it was dark. They leaked it at night.GLENN: Did they? Okay. So they did it during the day.STU: Yeah. They did it during the day. But what maybe -- the story came out during the day. Maybe it was leaked.GLENN: Okay. It's daylight someplace.STU: It's fear.GLENN: So we couldn't find that.We can't seem to get to the bottom of the Hunter Biden thing.STU: What evidence do we have, other than the entire laptop?GLENN: And we can't see the -- we can't see the evidence on the Las Vegas shooter. We still don't have a clue. And Nashville.STU: Yeah. That one is weird.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Can't see that manifesto, even though we have it.GLENN: Right.STU: We can speculate about what the Alan, Texas, shooter's manifesto was. Because they're going to go online and find some social media post.GLENN: But we can't do it.STU: Not only can we not get the actual information on the Nashville manifesto and see it. They won't even really tell us what's in it.GLENN: Hey, it's this one. This one.This one, they know. This Hispanic is part of a white --STU: Huge white supremacist. That's the -- that's what you need to know.GLENN: Okay. I'm just trying to get my arms -- well, let's talk about some real crimes. How about the Marine Daniel Penny, you know?STU: Hmm. Yeah.GLENN: Now we have the full videotape. The full videotape. I don't know if you've seen it yet. But it shows him choking the guy out, and then putting him in what is called the recover position. So he didn't just choke him out, like, yeah! He put him in a recovery position. STU: Or to contrast it with George Floyd, where that didn't end for a very, very long time. This person was obviously trying to bring back the guy he had choked to subdue him. During the attack. He was attempting, outwardly, to make sure, he didn't die.STU: That's why you have a recovery position.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah. That's exactly what it means. Now, there was protests in New York. Lots of lots of protests.STU: Very dumb protests. We should point out. Incredibly stupid.GLENN: No justice. No peace.STU: Saying stupid things. Just this idea -- this idea that it's murder. And, you know, like, they may finds that the New York law does not look favorably on what he did.I don't know. I'm not an expert on New York law. But I will say.GLENN: You know why we're not. Because we moved away from there because we were smart. Okay?Move away from New York.STU: I was born there. And I do not live there. And for a reason.GLENN: Yeah. No.STU: But, you know, they may come up with something and they may get this guy on.We don't know all the facts of the case yet.Though, I do think we know for certain, that he and the black guy that was helping him, were not out to murder black people all day. It was not a, hey. Let's go out and execute people for no reason, as it's being portrayed in the media.And I'm sincerely suspicious of the motivation of the black guy who was actually helping to subdue the guy of his motivation of trying to murder black people that day. It just seems like an odd thing for him to wake up to on his to-do list.GLENN: That black man is in the same white supremacy group.STU: Is he in Deathwatch?GLENN: Yeah. Right-wing -- yeah. STU: That's why. GLENN: So it's -- it's -- you know what I'm saying? It's pretty clear.STU: It's so stupid.GLENN: That they are opening up, their -- their -- you know, roles for volunteers and members. They're just opening it up. And saying, look, we're not going to let all blacks in. We're not going to let all Hispanics in. Just the ones that hate blacks and Hispanics.STU: That's so stupid. And it so exposes the left, what they're doing here. Like, this man meant nothing to them a week ago.When he was out on the subways like the lunatic that he was. Sadly. He had all sorts of mental health problems. He had a very --GLENN: Long record.STU: Long record. Over 40 arrests. They kept letting him out anyway. He went through a very traumatic experience early on in his life. Saw his mom murdered. Look, the guy had a terrible life. He was a Michael Jackson impersonator.GLENN: And it went downhill from there. You know, you don't really ever recover from that.STU: Yeah. You just think that -- things went downhill from there. If you were a Harvey Weinstein impersonator, I would assume business got bad there for a while, and the same thing happened with him.GLENN: I don't know.STU: The bottom line is he should not have been on that subway. He should not have been put in the position where he was threatening people on this train.GLENN: Yep. Yep. Uh-huh.STU: And all of left-wing society and media abandoned him until he was useful. Until that moment he was useful, which was, by the way, coincidentally the moment he died.   The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day.

BECKNews_53," Editor's Note: Glenn just purchased the entire 'Roe v. Wade' archive for his historical vault from Linda Coffee, the lawyer who first filed and argued the case. He didn't want the archive to end up in some pro-choice activist's house as a relic of abortion. He wanted to preserve 'Roe v. Wade' as a historical reminder of the sanctity of life and to never repeat the atrocities of 'Roe' ever again.  Glenn also wants to honor YOUR story alongside this historical document. Stories like the one you will read below will be recorded and stored alongside the 'Roe v. Wade' archive. Glenn wants to honor the mothers who were affected by Roe AND the babies who lost their lives to it.  If YOU have a story about abortion, whether you had an abortion and regretted it, or were planning on getting an abortion and decided not to, Glenn wants to hear from you. If you feel inclined, write your story down on paper, and send it to the P.O. box, which you can find HERE. Glenn will preserve your story as an important part of our nation's history.  Read the original story below.  I can no longer relate to the modern pro-choice woman. I dont want to shout my abortion. I want to pretend it never happened. Up until the SCOTUS leak, I had done a pretty good job of burying my 20-year secret. But the Roe v. Wade information earthquake triggered an eruption. I can no longer pretend to be ambivalent or leave it to blue-check pro-lifers to speak for me. My days of repeating the safe, legal, and rare mantra like a good, GenX libertarian feminist are over.  Some pro-abortion activists call their life-ending procedure self-care, like they just booked a hot stone massage or a facial at a spa. This is a polite euphemism many women tell themselves  not because we are cold-blooded killers, but because its how we survive. We HAVE to lie in order to justify what is actually taking place. Denial is a protective coating, a barrier from the truth. Remember, any woman born after Roe v. Wade has been programmed to believe that abortion is a natural-born right. Its legal; therefore it must not be evil. This is a medical procedure. Women do it every day. Planned Parenthood has a nice way of describing abortion on its website: A doctor uses a combination of medical tools and a suction device to gently take the pregnancy tissue out of your uterus. Gently take the tissue out. Benign euphemisms that wrap our hearts and minds in a suffocating cocoon. Benign euphemisms to keep us in line. I was raised in the Bible Belt and to believe that sex before marriage was the gravest of sins. Youd be better off robbing a store by pistol than to be caught fornicating with a boy. And yet I did fornicate with a boy. No boy Id ever be proud to bring around to my parents. I never gave him the option to talk me out of it. I just demanded he pay half for the procedure and never speak of it again. I told myself it would be easier to survive the hidden shame of the abortion than wear the shame of my sin on my belly for the next nine months. I took the so-called easy way out at six weeks along and swallowed a pill I got from some abortionist who gave me the creeps. He was no medical saint like the one portrayed in The Cider House Rules, nobly saving women from coat-hanger abortions. The doctor in my story made a quick buck at the expense of terrified good girls. Years later I would learn he kept aborted fetuses in buckets and was under investigation for shady medical practices. I couldnt leave his clinic fast enough, but at least I wouldnt have to miss work or skip my college classes. I could finish my degree and still make my parents proud. How convenient. But the pill I took made an ugly, painful mess, and it didnt finish the job. Now I had to see a real obstetrician, get an ultrasound, and deal with the aftermath. This doctors office was nicer. It had bright lights and pink walls. Although my doctor was professional, I still felt the quiet judgment in her voice. I refused to look at the image of my tortured fetus on the screen. I knew what it would mean if I did  my feminist career ambitions would lose the battle to my soul if I looked at that baby. The doctor told me the fetus was still viable but likely mentally damaged. The kinder thing to do would be to finish the job at an in-clinic abortion. End the fetus suffering and end my own self-torture. I woke up from anesthesia to learn the abortion was complete. It??s over so quickly, but the internal conflict hangs. And hangs. You find weird ways to cope. Not long after, I discovered an abandoned robin??s egg, still perfectly intact. I wrapped it in a sock and carried it with me for over a decade. If I couldn??t do right by my own child, maybe I could keep this unhatched egg safe. Eventually, I had to come to terms with the fact that the bird egg was dead, and I got therapy. He was a good New York psychologist. Secular, liberal, tolerant. He helped me to forgive myself, but I always knew who I really needed to ask for forgiveness ?? It??s easy for a young woman with all those stockpiled eggs in h""ries to be pro-choice. She can toss away the miracle of life like a rotten banana or a bruised apple because it is easily replaced. It wasnt until I was forced to confront the mortality of my own fertility that I felt the full force of my regret. But I do not write this letter to achieve redemption or to be the new face of the pro-life movement. You will not see me pleading with women outside an abortion clinic. You will not see me protesting with a cutesy, homemade sign at the March for Life. You will not see me sparring on Twitter, confronting baby-killers with cold, hard facts. For now, you will not even know my name. I suppose this is not very brave, but my story is not complete and Gods work in me is in an active state. Mine is a modest mission: Maybe if Im honest about my own wounds, I can help other women like me to heal. Maybe I can love the terrified, knocked-up woman in the Bible Belt who believes the best worst lies our society has ever told, better than any conservative talk show host ever could. The SCOTUS leak ripped a band-aid off a festering 50-year-old wound. Its naive to think we will fix this mess for the unborn overnight and deprogram men and women plugged into 50 years of slick, well-packaged lies. Slavery was legal in the U.S. for over 200 years before we fought a war to end it. And it was another 100 years before we ended state-sanctioned racism. When it comes to the issue of defending innocent life, I know it??s hard to be patient. This is a clear battle of good vs. evil for many on the right, but you need allies like me ?C the former ??safe, legal, and rare?? pro-choicers who are afraid to come out of the shadows. Afraid to become a political prop in the culture wars, but willing to do the quiet missionary work in our back yards. I hope for the day future progressives look back in horror at today??s progressives fighting to keep abortion on demand. I hope for the day the New York Times publishes the pro-life version of the 1619 Project. Maybe they??ll call it the ??1973 Project,?? ??whose mission is to reframe the country's history by placing the consequences of ab"" the contribution of the pro-life movement at the very center of our national narrative.?? Until that day, I want to help these women to be braver than me. To see beyond their impossible tomorrow. If I had allowed someone the chance to help me be brave, I might not have had the same successful career, but I would have a 20-year-old son or daughter in whom to invest this unexplained overflow in my heart.    WRITER  Texas is under threat of a George Soros-backed takeover. Soros-funded RINO judges have been elected in some of the highest courts in Texas. These judges implemented restrictions that have blocked nearly a thousand cases of voter fraud from being inv""tigated or prosecuted from across the state. These new restrictions are similar to ones in place in states like George, Arizona, and Wisconsin, leaving Texas more susceptible to election corruption than ever.

As Glenn recently covered, the Biden administration has been pressuring the world's largest bookseller, Amazon, into suppressing books they disagree with.

The documents, which Jordan dubbed ""The Amazon Files"" after Elon Musk's ""The Twitter Files,"" revealed an email conversation between Andrew Slavitt, a former White House senior adviser, and Amazon employees. In these emails, Slavitt complained that the top search results for books on ""vaccines"" were ""concerning"" and then requested that Amazon intervene. Amazon initially refused, not out of some altruistic concern for the free exchange of information. They thought any action taken would be ""too visible"" and would further exasperate the ??Harry/Sally narrative,?? referring to the outrage that followed Amazon's removal of Ryan T. Anderson??s book When Harry Became Sally.  Despite this initial refusal, Amazon agreed to meet with the White House a few days later.

Recently, there has been a string of attacks against the rights outlined in the First Amendment: the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, the freedom of assembly, and the freedom to petition. As a refresher, the First Amendment reads as follows: This is powerful stuff, there is a good reason the Founding Fathers made it the FIRST Amendment. It's also the reason why power-hungry elites are attacking it. These attacks are designed to control the way you think, speak, and believe, vote, what you read, and who holds your representatives responsible. The First Amendment is our strongest weapon against tyrants, and they know it. So what can you do about it? Hope that some wig in Washinton will eventually do something? We know how well that works. The best thing to do is to stay active, engage in the issues you care about, and exercise your rights.  So where to start? Here are a few things YOU can do to protect your First Amendment rights:                                Religion                                   The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is toyou guessed itpractice your faith. Become an active member in your place of worship, go to scripture studies, invite your friends to that late afternoon event, and walk the life. This can impact the way you spend money as well. Shop the businesses and brands that share your values, and don't shop at the ones that scorn them. Keeping the community alive and healthy is the best way to ensure that generations to come will be able to experience the freedom you enjoy.                              Speech                                   Much like religion, the best way to protect your freedom of speech is... to speak. Engage your friends and family in polite, civil conversation. Stand up for what you believe in, and make your case to your peers. Just remember to keep it friendly. No one ever won an argument by shouting down their opponent. The civil exchange of ideas is the cornerstone of our republic, and a dialogue where the participants are well-informed, considerate, compassionate, and open-minded can have permanent impacts on all involved.                              Press                                   Freedom of the Press seems a little tricky at first. Unless you work for the media, what are you supposed to do? Quit your job and go work for the local newspaper? The good news is that exercising this right is not nearly that difficult. In fact, you are currently doing it. The best thing you can do is to read from outlets that produce informative content. Want to know what Glenn consumes to stay informed every day?

BECKNews_55," Silicon Valley Bank was shut down by regulators last week, marking the biggest bank failure since the 2008 collapse. So what happened? And what does this mean for YOUR finances? In this clip, Glenn explains exactly how SVG collapsed, why the Fed is to blame, and why working with a FDIC insured institution is IMPERATIVE.     Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Here's what happened. A couple of things. First of all, we're raising rates.We had the COVID money coming in, right? To haveAnd you just heard there, all this COVID money. Well, they wanted to invest it. They needed to put it in some place. And invest it.Silicon Valley. They had so much money coming in from COVID.And so what did they do?They bought treasuries. And at the time, you could buy a ten-year treasury, and you would get 2 percent interest. Guaranteed, at the end of ten years.That was pretty good back then.But now, treasuries are selling for about 5 percent interest.And you don't get that, until the end of the ten years.So when I buy something, a ten-year treasury, you're buying it for ten years.If you have only eight years on it, you can sell it, but you're going to probably have to sell it at a discount if the new ones are paying more. So they invested the -- the money in treasuries, at 2 percent.Just let's remember that. What they had in the bank, if you will -- they owed $195 billion. That's to the people who have put their money into checking accounts and savings accounts, mutual funds. They owed $195 billion. They had 208 billion, on the books.That's a 17 billion-dollar -- when you have people all over the world starting to say, I think the bank is starting to collapse. They start to take their money. $17 billion can go that fast.There was a clog in the system, that couldn't get the money wired out fast enough.So they decided, they needed to sell. And then they announced, we're going to sell some Treasuries.Well, once they saw that they were selling ten-year bonds, at 2 percent interest, and the market was saying, well, that's only worth 75 cents on the dollar in you.And Silicon Valley bank was like taking it. They knew, this is a fire sale.This bank is in trouble. That's what started all of the run on the bank. Now, you probably have FDIC insurance.If you have FDIC insurance, it's to stop runs on the bank. However, Silicon Valley bank is different. It's very different.I think it's 88 percent of their accounts, are not covered by FDIC. Why?Because they're giant companies that are using payroll and keeping their money in the bank, as -- as the place where they can run their company.So they -- they have more than 250,000 dollars in account. If they also, use the bank for a mutual fund, they found out Friday, they were also screwed.See, this bank, loans money to these companies. These tech companies.And they loan them out, venture capital.And so they loan them the money to operate, and to be able to do everything they can, over the next year.Well, they've got to put that money somewhere.So the bank loans it out.It's basically the depositor's money.They loan that savings account of yours, per se.And loan it to this venture capital firm.Or, or -- the tech startup. And the tech startup then says, where do I put all this money?And Silicon Valley bank says, oh, just in my other hand. Just give me my money back, and we'll invest it in mutual funds for you. We'll invest it in very safe things like BlackRock. So they did. And the tech companies thought they were safe.Because it's invested in very secure places like BlackRock.Except, what the bank didn't say, except in fine print. Is that all the money that you had invested, in BlackRock, was not yours anymore.It was -- it was under the name Silicon Valley bank.So when people started to call and say, hey, BlackRock, my money is safe. They said, you don't have any money.Your money is invested in Silicon Valley bank. And because their name is on it, they're counting that as an asset. And now that asset as has to go to pay creditors.So they lost their money. This is a giant shell game.We have created nothing, but a shell game.And the fed is the one that is causing this collapse, by the raising of the rates. But if you don't raise the rates, what happens?Inflation goes out of control!Why?Because we have printed and loaned too much money out.Okay. We'll pull it back in.Well, the way you pull it back in, is raising interest rates. If you raise the interest rates, bonds have to pay a higher yield, and so when you buy a bond, you get more money back. And if somebody gets into trouble, they have to sell their bonds, exactly like Silicon Valley. And they have to take a hair cut. And then the entire thing collapses.But here's the scariest thing.This is what the fed has set out to do.They want to see risky things, go away.They want to see failure.They need to people who are not stable to go out of business. Stop spending money. So we can suck all that money back in. But when they do collapse it. And our economy is in this kind of shape. You then have a domino effect, because nobody is in great shape.And thing banks are playing a giant game.So then people can't pay the paycheck. And then that paycheck falls -- causes you to default on your auto loan. Or your house loan.And that makes another bank fail.We're at the place, I told you in 2008. We would be. We have made the 2008 problem much bigger, and there's no way out.Once you start printing money, there's no way out.And what did we do?Well, the fed said, we're not doing TARP. No, no, no. We have something entirely different. It's got a different name and everything. But we're going to cover all of those accounts.Oh. Oh, okay.So we're backing -- we're backing that now.Yeah. But it's not your money. It's not your money. It's the fed's money.It's the fed's money? Yeah. It's the money that the banks gave to us, to put aside for insurance in case something like this happened. Oh.Where -- where did the banks get that money? Well, I don't know. Doing business.Well, I mean, aren't these the banks you bailed out?Well, yeah. And weren't you just giving them trillions of dollars is ifWell, yeah. Of course, we did. But they were paying in to this account.Oh, okay. So the money you printed, that I'm on the hook for, you think to the bank, but they didn't use any of that money for that insurance?No!No. This is totally different.Okay.So now they're going to be protected, and I don't have an answer for you. Today.Because all of the answers are bad answers. Should we back that?No. No.The constitutionalist, capitalist in me, says that's really bad.Okay. So we don't back it. Well, no. No.Because the guy who would like to see the entire western world not burn down to the ground, would like you to bail it out, just to give us some more time.But that puts us right back where we were.So I don't have -- I prayed hard today. What do I tell people?Work on your spiritual health.Because this is coming. At some point. It's coming. It has to. It has to. Now, the Washington Post said today, that the baggage's death marks both a sobering and salutary moment here. The central bank has sharply increased interest rates over the past year, hoping higher borrowing costs would slow the economy down, and take the steam out of high inflation. This is what the fed wants to see. They want to see a tightening of the financial conditions.Great! They're on it. The Washington Post. With $209 billion in assets, the bank was just 118th the size of JP Morgan Chase. The nation's largest. Still Wall Street Journal was rattled by their abrupt end.Bank of America was down nearly 12 percent in the past five trading sessions. They're down another five or about four and a half percent today.Some banks are down as much as 10 percent today, before trading even started. The banks that served the riskiest part of the country and the economy, are the ones in trouble. Now, this is the Washington Post. I want you to listen to this.Banks like SVB and Silvergate Capital, a San Diego-based bank that catered to cryptocurrency users, are the ones that are getting into trouble.Oh. It's not a run -- it's not a run on the business model of the bank, it's -- it's not -- I'm sorry. It's not a run on the business model of the banking industry, in general, it's just the business model of this bank. So, in other words, if you are making risky loans, to -- to tech, or if you're investing and doing anything at all with cryptocurrency.You're the problem. Hmm. That's interesting.I'm going to tie some of this together here. We have a lot to go over, in just a second.Sadly, it probably comes as no surprise, that anyone after the overturning of Roe vs. Wade. Abortion is still the number one killer among infants. We're still killing nearly a million of our own children, every single year.And that is still here, in the United States.I asked you, by the way, if you had had an abortion. You knew somebody that did. And they regret it.Or you're F you're a child. That somebody tried. Mom tried to end your life. And you lived. Or she changed your mind. Will you write me a letter, and tell me your story?I have something coming. That I'm working on.And I will keep your name out of it.You can use an assumed name. We just need your phone number, so that we can call and verify that you're an actual person. But all the details are at GlennBeck.com.But we are fighting the good fight. I don't think there is anything we could do that would be more important than standing up and stopping the slaughter of our children.For $140, you can introduce moms to their babies on an ultrasound. And help rescue five babies. When you do, you will see five stories, and five ultrasound pictures of babies saved. Preborn's goal this year is to rescue 80,000 babies, just from this audience. That's our goal.They can only do it with your help. So will you join us?Dial #250. Say the key word baby. Give just a dollar, $10, $140; 15,000 buys an ultrasound machine.#250. Key word baby. Or go to Preborn.com/Beck. That's Preborn.com/Beck.Ten-second station ID.(music)Okay. So here's something you probably didn't know: The New York Times is reporting today, that good thing this bank has been saved. Silicon Valley Bank was in many ways, a climate bank. When you have the majority of the market banking through one institution, there will be a lot of collateral damage. Community solar projects appeared to be especially hard hit. Silicon Valley banks said, it led or participated in 62 percent of financing deals for community solar projects. Their smaller scale solar projects also serve lower income residential areas. Don't worry. Don't worry. The fed is covering all of this.The devastation comes at a critical moment.It is central to cut the greenhouse gases that are dangerously heating the planet, says the New York Times.The federal government depends on climate technically companies to develop the innovations needed.This is going to set the climate change industry down and set them back, for years.Hmm. Gee. Well, good thing we're not drilling for oil. Good thing we're getting rid of all of our backup power plants, isn't it?Home Depot cofounder said, the global lending firm, Silicon Valley bank, went broke because it was woke.Now, the rising interest rates are really -- really why. But if you want to look at their business model, these guys are woke activists. He said, instead of protecting the shareholders and their employees, they're more concerned about the social policies.As recently as this month just days before it went into receivership with the FDIC, the Silicon Valley bank discussed decarbonization, gay rights, the black venture ecosystem. And so much more.Well, they were woke. Good thing.Good thing. By the way, they were purchased this morning. By a British bank. Because Great Britain was worried about their tech industry. As SVB, funded a lot of their stuff too.So that's good news   The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy people on the left. The AOC's have taken over, places in the media.And places like this in New York.This is what it is thousand. So there's been one case. One. One in the entire seven years. Where they did this.Where they shut down a company, that had no obvious victims.The case was 1972.And it was a company, relatively small company, that was writing term papers, for college students. Okay.So I want to write my paper.GLENN: I want to break out in God bless America.STU: Capitalism is pretty impressive. Apparently, this didn't go over that well.What they said, there were no obvious victims here. The people bought the term papers. They didn't want to write them. They got the term papers. They said, they were defrauding the education system.GLENN: Which they were.STU: This is the one time. And it's a small tiny company. Let me give you the other times they've done this.Tell me if any of these sound like, hey, I have a good interest rate, on a loan I paid back.Number one, a breast cancer nonprofit was shut down a do",-10,-10,
BECKNews_56,"WRITER  Since November, Americans have been on the edge of their seats wondering just what will Beto ORourke do next? How will he follow up losing a U.S. Senate race, dropping out of the U.S. presidential race, and then losing the Texas governors race? How do you top a trifecta like that?   Well, now we finally know the answer. Hes going to be a professor this semester at the University of Chicago. And not a moment too soon. Professor Beto will be teaching college students about Democracy& which is a terrifying idea.   Fortunately, we got our hands on an advanced copy of Professor Betos course syllabus&  Syllabus  Course Title:  Failing Upward 101: How to Succeed in Life Without Really Trying  Session 1 Cultural Appropriation: Why Its Wrong and Why You Should Also Try It  Session 2 Converting White Guilt into Cold Hard Cash  Session 3  Marrying Wealth: The Underrated Value of Money Over Love  Session 4 Ensuring a Womans Right to Choose Abortion Every Time  Session 5 Campaigning as a Career Path (Special Guest Lecturer  Stacey Abrams)  Session 6 Effin Fundamentals: Winning Techniques for Swearing Good  Session 7 Squirrels Are People Too: Animal Rehab as Spiritual Discipline  Session 8 Abolishing Republicans in Our Lifetime: Gulags and Other Viable Options   Session 9 The Subtle Art of Caring Too Much: Why Socialism Rocks!  Session 10 Style Over Substance: My Foolproof Life Hack     WRITER  Texas is under threat of a George Soros-backed takeover. Soros-funded RINO judges have been elected in some of the highest courts in Texas. These judges implemented restrictions that have blocked nearly a thousand cases of voter fraud from being investigated or p""osecuted from across the state. These new restrictions are similar to ones in place in states like George, Arizona, and Wisconsin, leaving Texas more susceptible to election corruption than ever. If Texas falls to corruption, America will lose its largest bastion of conservative electoral power in the nation. Without Texas, Republicans WILL NOT be able to win national elections and liberal corruption will go unchecked across the country.  Fortunately, there is a way to stop this: YOU. If you live in Texas you have a chance to stand up against corruption and to fight back! Starting Tuesday, February 20th, early voting for the primaries begins, where three of these judges are up for election. Go out and vote. If the right people are voted in, there's a good chance the restrictions will be lifted and election fraud can once again be prosecuted.  But remember, you can't just go in and vote for anyone who has an ""R"" next to their name. Sorors knows that a registered Democrat would never stand a chance in Texas, so his lackeys register as Republicans and ride the little ""R"" right into office. So who do you vote for?  Fortunately, Glenn had Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on his show today and Ken gave us his list of judges that he vouches for. His list is as follows:    WRITER  Who is really banning books? For years now, Conservatives have been taking flak from the left for supposed ""book bans."" The left likes to compare these ""bans"" to Nazi book burnings, accusing the right of sweeping authoritarian decrees designed to suppress information. In reality, this is a movement largely motivated by parents, who want to remove inappropriate books from children's libraries.  But if you want to discuss authoritarian book bans, look no further than the White House. As Glenn recently covered, the Biden administration has been pressuring the world's largest bookseller, Amazon, into suppressing books they disagree with. On February 5th, 2024, Ohio Representative Jim Jordan released a slew of subpoenaed documents that exposed pressure placed on Amazon by the Biden Administration. The documents, which Jordan dubbed ""The Amazon Files"" after Elon Musk's ""The Twitter Files,"" revealed an email conversation between Andrew Slavitt, a former White House senior adviser, and Amazon employees. In these emails, Slavitt complained that the top search results for books on ""vaccines"" were ""concerning"" and then requested that Amazon intervene. Amazon initially refused, not out of some altruistic concern for the free exchange of information. They thought any action taken would be ""too visible"" and would further exasperate the ??Harry/Sally narrative,?? referring to the outrage that followed Amazon's removal of Ryan T. Anderson??s book When Harry Became Sally.  Despite this initial refusal, Amazon agreed to meet with the White House a few days later. The number one item on their agenda was""oving books from the website. An Amazon employee even admitted that the reason they even took this meeting was due to the pressure being placed on them by the Biden Administration.  What was the result of this meeting? Amazon caved. They began to implement ways of limiting the outreach of books that challenged the mainstream vaccine narrative and other books the White House might not like. The White House was caught red-handed pressuring the world's largest bookseller to restrict the sale of books they consider in opposition to their narrative, and they have the gall to accuse conservatives of information suppression. This is just ONE of many actions committed by the Biden Administration that are more characteristic of a dictator than a president. What can you do about it? Fortunately, you are not dependent on Amazon and its corrupted algorithm to help you find books. Every week right here on GlennBeck.com, we highlight books that Glenn is reading or talking about in our ""Glenn's Bookshelf"" series. Here you can find a wide selection of books free from Amazon's filters. Be sure to sign up for Glenn's newsletter to find out about new additions to ""Glenn's Bookshelf"" every week.    WRITER   The left-wing media's most recent tirade is accusing Trump of being a dictator. But, as Glenn said, ""Everything they're accusing us of, they're doing."" Since day one, the Biden administration has overstepped the bounds placed on the executive branch set by the Constitution. In Glenn's most recent TV Special, he examined ten times Biden acted like a dictator, NOT a president. Here are 10 of Biden's Dictator Moves, and click HERE to get ALL of the research that went into this week's Glenn TV special:     WRITER   Every day it seems Glenn covers another story revealing how people across the world at all levels of power DESPISE the fact that YOU have rights, and they are actively trying to curtail them. Recently, there has been a string of attacks against the rights outlined in the First Amendment: the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, the freedom of assembly, and the freedom to petition. As a refresher, the First Amendment reads as follows: This is powerful stuff, there is a good reason the Founding Fathers made it the FIRST Amendment. It's also the reason why power-hungry elites are attacking it. These attacks are designed to control the way you think, speak, and believe, vote, what you read, and who holds your representatives responsible. The First Amendment is our strongest weapon against tyrants, and they know it. So what can you do about it? Hope that some wig in Washinton will eventually do something? We know how well that works. The best thing to do is to stay active, engage in the issues you care about, and exercise your rights.  So where to start? Here are a few things YOU can do to protect your First Amendment rights:                                Religion                                   The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is toyou guessed itpractice your faith. Become an active member in your place of worship, go to scripture studies, invite your friends to that late afternoon event, and walk the life. This can impact the way you spend money as well. Shop the businesses and brands that share your values, and don't shop at the ones that scorn them. Keeping the community alive and healthy is the best way to ensure that generations to come will be able to experience the freedom you enjoy.                              Speech                                   Much like religion, the best way to protect your freedom of speech is... to speak. Engage your friends and family in polite, civil conversation. Stand up for what you believe in, and make your case to your peers. Just remember to keep it friendly. No one ever won an argument by shouting down their opponent. The civil exchange of ideas is the cornerstone of our republic, and a dialogue where the participants are well-informed, considerate, compassionate, and open-minded can have permanent impacts on all involved.                              Press                                   Freedom of the Press seems a little tricky at first. Unless you work for the media, what are you supposed to do? Quit your job and go work for the local newspaper? The good news is that exercising this right is not nearly that difficult. In fact, you are currently doing it. The best thing you can do is to read from outlets that produce informative content. Want to know what Glenn consumes to stay informed every day?

Assembly                                    Anna Moneymaker / Staff | Getty ImagesFreedom of assembly is one of the more impactful yet underutilized freedoms in the First Amendment. Peaceably assembling and protesting with like-minded individuals can hugely influence politicians and policies while simultaneously creating community and fellowship between attendees. It's understandable why more people don't turn out. We're all busy people with busy schedules, and flying out to D.C. for the weekend seems like a daunting task to many. Thankfully, you don't have to go out all the way to D.C. to make a difference. Gather some like-minded people in your town and bring awareness to issues that impact your community. Big change starts locally, and exercising your freedom to assemble can be the catalyst to lasting impact.                               Petition                                   If you've been a long-time listener of Glenn, then you will have heard a few of his calls to action where he asks his audience to contact their representatives about a particular piece of policy. There is a good reason Glenn keeps on doing those: they work. Whether it's your local mayor or your senator, a call and an email go a long way. If you really want to make a change, convince your friends and family to reach out as well. The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is to??you guessed it??practice your faith. Become an active member in your place of worship, go to scripture studies, invite your friends to that late afternoon event, and walk the life. This can impact the way you spend money as well. Shop the businesses and brands that share your values, and don't shop at the ones that scorn them. Keeping the community alive and healthy is the best way to ensure that generations to come will be able to experience the freedom you ",-4,-5,

These judges implemented restricti""that have blocked nearly a thousand cases of voter fraud from being investigated or prosecuted from across the state. These new restrictions are similar to ones in place in states like George, Arizona, and Wisconsin, leaving Texas more susceptible to election corruption than ever. If Texas falls to corruption, America will lose its largest bastion of conservative electoral power in the nation. Without Texas, Republicans WILL NOT be able to win national elections and liberal corruption will go unchecked across the country.  Fortunately, there is a way to stop this: YOU. If you live in Texas you have a chance to stand up against corruption and to fight back! Starting Tuesday, February 20th, early voting for the primaries begins, where three of these judges are up for election. Go out and vote. If the right people are voted in, there's a good chance the restrictions will be lifted and election fraud can once again be prosecuted.  But remember, you can't just go in and vote for anyone who has an ""R"" next to their name. Sorors knows that a registered Democrat would never stand a chance in Texas, so his lackeys register as Republicans and ride the little ""R"" right into office. So who do you vote for?  Fortunately, Glenn had Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on his show today and Ken gave us his list of judges that he vouches for. His list is as follows:    WRITER  Who is really banning books? For years now, Conservatives have been taking flak from the left for supposed ""book bans."" The left likes to compare these ""bans"" to Nazi book burnings, accusing the right of sweeping authoritarian decrees designed to suppress information. In reality, this is a movement largely motivated by parents, who want to remove inappropriate books from children's libraries.  But if you want to discuss authoritarian book bans, look no further than the White House. As Glenn recently covered, the Biden administration has been pressuring the world's largest bookseller, Amazon, into suppressing books they disagree with. On February 5th, 2024, Ohio Representative Jim Jordan released a slew of subpoenaed documents that exposed pressure placed on Amazon by the Biden Administration. The documents, which Jordan dubbed ""The Amazon Files"" after Elon Musk's ""The Twitter Files,"" revealed an email conversation between Andrew Slavitt, a former White House senior adviser, and Amazon employees. In these emails, Slavitt complained that the top search results for books on ""vaccines"" were ""concerning"" and then requested that Amazon intervene. Amazon initially refused, not out of some altruistic concern for the free exchange of information. They thought any action taken would be ""too visible"" and would further exasperate the ??Harry/Sally narrative,?? referring to the outrage that followed Amazon's removal of Ryan T. Anderson??s book When Harry Became Sally.  Despite this initial refusal, Amazon agreed to meet with the White House a few days later. The number one item on their agenda was""oving books from the website. An Amazon employee even admitted that the reason they even took this meeting was due to the pressure being placed on them by the Biden Administration.  What was the result of this meeting? Amazon caved. They began to implement ways of limiting the outreach of books that challenged the mainstream vaccine narrative and other books the White House might not like. The White House was caught red-handed pressuring the world's largest bookseller to restrict the sale of books they consider in opposition to their narrative, and they have the gall to accuse conservatives of information suppression. This is just ONE of many actions committed by the Biden Administration that are more characteristic of a dictator than a president. What can you do about it?

BECKNews_58,"  	On the radio program Wednesday, Glenn Beck had words for any of the unhinged pro-abortion advocates who've lost their minds over the  	leaked draft majority opinion, which indicates that the U.S. Supreme Court plans to overturn Roe v. Wade, the controversial 1973 decision to legalize abortion nationwide.   	Glenn said that people in this country who lament that ""just five people are going to make the decision for the rest of us"" in reference to the five Supreme Court Justices who are in favor of overturning Roe v. Wade, should actually welcome the idea of having duly elected state officials making decisions instead of Supreme Court justices who are appointed by the president.   	""What the Supreme Court did yesterday was very clear. It did  	not ban abortion. It didn't. What it did was return the power to the people,"" Glenn stated.   ""These five people should  	 not be making the decision on something so personal,"" he said of the Supreme Court justices. ""That is up to the people themselves to decide. It's empowering for the average person [to turn abortion laws over to state legislature.]""  	""It's amazing how dumb Americans have become, because of our teachers' unions, because of our media, and, quite honestly, because of our political parties,"" Glenn added. ""America, you're an idiot. Now, do you want to stop being an idiot? Then maybe you should  	educate yourself.""  Glenn went on to review the latest examples of ""leftist short-term memory loss,"" as pundits use the same arguments in support of Roe v. Wade that would have kept in place other terrible Supreme Court decisions, like ""separate but equal."" Do they know their fearmongering completely contradicts everything they've been saying prior to this? Or is it that they just don't care?

Recently, there has been a string of attacks against the rights outlined in the First Amendment: the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, the freedom of assembly, and the freedom to petition. As a refresher, the First Amendment reads as follows: This is powerful stuff, there is a good reason the Founding Fathers made it the FIRST Amendment. It's also the reason why power-hungry elites are attacking it. These attacks are designed to control the way you think, speak, and believe, vote, what you read, and who holds your representatives responsible. The First Amendment is our strongest weapon against tyrants, and they know it. So what can you do about it? Hope that some wig in Washinton will eventually do something? We know how well that works. The best thing to do is to stay active, engage in the issues you care about, and exercise your rights.  So where to start? Here are a few things YOU can do to protect your First Amendment rights:                                Religion                                   The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is toyou guessed itpractice your faith.

Shop the businesses and brands that share your values, and don't shop at the ones that scorn them. Keeping the community alive and healthy is the best way to ensure that generations to come will be able to experience the freedom you enjoy.                              Speech                                   Much like religion, the best way to protect your freedom of speech is... to speak. Engage your friends and family in polite, civil conversation. Stand up for what you believe in, and make your case to your peers. Just remember to keep it friendly. No one ever won an argument by shouting down their opponent. The civil exchange of ideas is the cornerstone of our republic, and a dialogue where the participants are well-informed, considerate, compassionate, and open-minded can have permanent impacts on all involved.

Peaceably assembling and protesting with like-minded individuals can hugely influence politicians and policies while simultaneously creating community and fellowship between attendees. It's understandable why more people don't turn out. We're all busy people with busy schedules, and flying out to D.C. for the weekend seems like a daunting task to many. Thankfully, you don't have to go out all the way to D.C. to make a difference. Gather some like-minded people in your town and bring awareness to issues that impact your community. Big change starts locally, and exercising your freedom to assemble can be the catalyst to lasting impact.                               Petition                                   If you've been a long-time listener of Glenn, then you will have heard a few of his calls to action where he asks his audience to contact their representatives about a particular piece of policy. There is a good reason Glenn keeps on doing those: they work. Whether it's your local mayor or your senator, a call and an email go a long way. If you really want to make a change, convince your friends and family to reach out as well. The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is to??you guessed it??practice your faith. Become an active member in your place of worship, go to scripture studies, invite your friends to that late afternoon event, and walk the life. This can impact the way you spend money as well. Shop the businesses and brands that share your values, and don't shop at the ones that scorn them. Keeping the community alive and healthy is the best way to ensure that generations to come will be able to experience the freedom you enjoy. Much like rel",-3,-4,
BECKNews_59," The far-lefts pro abortion agenda is NOT about womens health, Glenn argues. Because if it was, why would they be declaring WAR against alternative options to Planned Parenthood? Why would they be enraged by some women choosing to receive good healthcare from pro-life centers? In this clip, Glenn details some of the far-lefts latest efforts to DESTROY pro-life health institutions. He explains why their actions are EVIL and why its time we label it that, too....    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to play this audio from -- from Elizabeth Warren.And then I want to explain it. Listen to what Elizabeth Warren said.VOICE: Right now. Those Crisis Pregnancy Centers, that are there. To fool people, who are looking for pregnancy termination help. Outnumber true abortion clinics, by 3:1. We need to shut it down here in Massachusetts. And we need to shut them down all around the country.GLENN: Listen to that.VOICE: We should not be able to torture a pregnant person like that.STU: Hmm. Hmm. Can you imagine the horror of someone who wants to kill their baby, and being fooled, fooled by someone into tricking a human being into being alive?GLENN: I think it's really important, that you understand, what she's actually saying, and how they're fooling people. And we'll give that to you here in just a second.First, let me tell you about Goldline. Gee, what's inflation?Inflation, higher than expected. What? They didn't expect any inflation. So everything is higher than they expected. Anyway, it's 9.1. We just found out, that's the new number for inflation. That's not the real number.And you know it. Every time you go out and try to buy something. Go to the grocery store. Go to the gas station. 9.1.Uh-huh. Recession is a very ugly word. But that is what we are going into.And we might go into stagflation. Which is even worse.Your money is being devalued. It's not that prices are going up. It's that your money. The value is going down.Because there's too much money out there. Plenty of money, but nothing our money could buy.I want you to find out, and see if gold or silver would be a good hedge for you.I don't know if you saw, there's another story. Joe Biden just -- just guaranteed all the pensions for the unions. Meanwhile, a lot of people are losing money, hand over fist, with their 401(k). Or their -- their Roth IRA. And there's no protection for you there from the United States government.Well, because you didn't work in a good union job. Anyway, I urge you to call Goldline. And find out if gold or silver is right for you. They can help you transfer some of your Roth IRA into precious metals to help hold the value. They also have a new product, that they have been waiting to come in. And I have been waiting as well. With every quarter ounce gold Benjamin Franklin round, that is sold this week. And it is something that I designed. I think these are printed by the Canadian mint.But it's Ben Franklin on the front. And it is the seal of America, that he wanted. And it is the -- it's pharaoh, in the waters, as the Red Sea is coming around him. And Moses is there.And the pillar of fire. It's an amazing coin. It's a Benjamin Franklin gold round. Quarter ounce. You can get this. And when I buy it, for every one you buy, you'll receive ten mind your own business silver bars at no cost. Now is the time to stock up. Call 866GOLDLINE. 866GOLDLINE.Call them now. 866GOLDLINE or goldline.com. Ten-second station ID.(music)All right. For the left, it has never been about protecting women's health in the abortion debate. They kept saying. They do other things. Women's health. Women's health. It was only about abortion centers. That's all it was about. Abortion.Because why would you -- why would you not support pro-life pregnancy centers that are helping women?You want to shut them down. And take away any competitor to Planned Parenthood? If it was really about women's health care, wouldn't you care, you know, that women and children are getting good care, elsewhere?Pro-life pregnancy centers, are providing an alternative to Planned Parenthood. Now the left's true colors are coming out. It's not just shout your abortion. It is put all anti-abortion or pro-life pregnancy centers out, so women have no choice.Last week, New York State attorney general, sent a letter to Google, demanding that it remove pro-life pregnancy centers from all search results. She said, it's because, they direct individuals seeking abortions to dangerous and misleading anti-abortion clinics, in New York.Planned Parenthood says the goal of these pro-life pregnancy centers is to spread misinformation, and propaganda.So those are their -- the left's too favorite words. Because they sound very dangerous. And, you know, you're not supposed to have that information.Now Elizabeth Warren, leading the charge in Congress, to protect America's pregnant women. From all that toxic disinformation.That could save their baby's lives. She tweeted. With Roe gone, it's more important than ever, to crack down on the so-called Crisis Pregnancy Centers. That mislead and deceive patients, seeking abortion care.So she wants to deputize the Federal Trade Commission, to be a police, and -- and police all of this alleged disinformation. So now, what is it, that is the disinformation?Well, NARAL, has exposed the disinformation. The bombshell lies that Elizabeth Warren is saying, quote. More than 67 percent of the locations intentionally referred to, the fetus, as a baby.They also tell -- told the investigator, with NARAL, she was already a mother, because she was already pregnant.Oh, my gosh. Well, this is -- I mean, next thing, you know, they're going to be roped into a loan, they never wanted for a house, they never could afford. Wow. So they -- they referred to the fetus -- Stu, would you just look up, in Latin, what fetus means.I believe it means little one. They refer to the fetus as a baby. And said, you're already a mom. Because you have a baby inside of you.Oh, my gosh. That could have been a toaster oven in her. They didn't know.So they don't like the fact that nationwide, pro-life pregnancy centers outnumber abortion clinics, 3:1. And they don't like the study last year, that found pregnant women who visit pro-life centers are 20 percent less likely to choose an abortion. They want you to be funneled into Planned Parenthood. So you have no choice.To top it off, the radical action is in response to the Supreme Court's decision, that doesn't stop abortion. Did you hear that? Pro-abortion fanatics in New York, California, and elsewhere. If you like your abortion laws, you can keep your abortion laws.But this time, it's actually true!But now they're declaring war. They're declaring war on pro-life pregnancy centers. Because it's never about choice. And it's never about women and children's health.It's always been about killing children. It is evil. It is absolutely evil.And it needs to be stated, that clearly. You know, when America had rare, safe, but legal, I think that's where most Americans are. They don't want to see it. You know, happening on demand.You know, hey, I can kill a baby, an hour before I -- it's just -- it's obscene to people.But when they went to shout your abortion. I'm proud to have had six abortions, or whatever. That's when it really became apparent, that they didn't mean what they said. They intended on a slippery slope, the entire time.And, you know, they told us once, that, oh, no. No money will ever go to our abortions. Well, your tax dollars will go to abortions. ICE is now transporting migrant women across state lines, so they can get abortions.ICE will not tabling those migrant women, a/k/a illegal aliens, across the border. But they will take them out of Texas, into another state, that will provide an abortion for them. That's a use of your tax dollars.The DOJ is creating a reproductive rights task force as well. Hmm. Okay. So the DOJ, which is not going after investigating people who are offering bounties for information. Anybody who has information on where the Supreme Court justices are. They're not doing anything about that.But they are going to collaborate, with, quote, external stakeholders, such as reproductive service providers. Huh. I wonder who that -- would that be Planned Parenthood?They are working for Planned Parenthood. It's evil.   The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy people on the left. The AOC's have taken over, places in the media.And places like this in New York.This is what it is thousand. So there's been one case. One. One in the entire seven years. Where they did this.Where they shut down a company, that had no obvious victims.The case was 1972.And it was a company, relatively small company, that was writing term papers, for college students. Okay.So I want to write my paper.GLENN: I want to break out in God bless America.STU: Capitalism is pretty impressive. Apparently, this didn't go over that well.What they said, there were no obvious victims here. The people bought the term papers. They didn't want to write them. They got the term papers. They said, they were defrauding the education system.GLENN: Which they were.STU: This is the one time. And it's a small tiny company. Let me give you the other times they've done this.Tell me if any of these sound like, hey, I have a good interest rate, on a loan I paid back.Number one, a breast cancer nonprofit was shut down a dozen years ago. For using nearly all its $9 million in donations to pay for director's salaries, perks, and other expenses, instead of funding free mammograms. Okay.So they told everyone, donate money for free. Mammograms. And they just took all the money for themselves.That's number one. Number two, a private equity timber.Faking big investment success, was closed down after stealing millions of dollars from thousands of investors.Okay?You can see.GLENN: Yeah. Got it. But on both of those so far, you have hundreds of thousands of people, you know, I'm sure. That gave -- they're all victims.They gave their money.STU: Yeah. And they didn't get the thing that they want.GLENN: They didn't get the thing they were promised. You have all these people going to the AG. Saying, hey, this is a real problem here. This has to stop. Not here.GLENN: Not here.STU: Another one. Mental health facility, shuttered for looting $4 million from public funds, while neglecting patients.GLENN: Okay. Kind of a big one.STU: Pretty clear. An auto lender that allegedly charged hidden interest rates, got to stay in business last year if it paid a fine and didn't commit fraud in the future.So here's one they didn't shut down.They actually let them go on.They're going after Trump in all of this. In this one, they're like, oh. Sure, they're hidden fees.They're not telling you about them.GLENN: Okay.STU: A judge requested.A judge refused to request to shut down a river rafting company in 2011.After a customer drowned, and the attorney general showed it was repeatedly using unlicensed guides, or none at all.Instead, he ordered only a 50,000-dollar bond and cleanup -- for him to clean up his act.The company is still being run today, under a different name by the same family. Someone died.GLENN: We have thousands of victims.And in this case, somebody who is dead.STU: Is dead!GLENN: Dead!STU: They're like, you guys can stay open -- and then this one is my favorite one. A judge in 2001.Declined to appoint a receiver, to take over a porn site, despite millions of dollars of illegal credit card charges to hundreds of customers.Who thought they were getting a free tour.Now, look, you're -- you want to get the free -- you want to know what you're subscribing for, Glenn. Before you just pulled the trigger on that. So you put your credit card information into a porn site, I think some of these victims need some life changes to be made here.But they put their credit card into a porn site. Expecting a free tour.They instead, get charged and charged and charged and charged.In fact, once the owners of the site were caught, they attempted to move their money overseas, to avoid any penalty.Still, the judge said, appointing a receiver was an extraordinary remedy!That should be used sparingly, and that a preliminary injunction was good enough.Only after all that happened, it they find out, the people running the porn site, were the Gambino crime family.(laughter)I kid you not.

BECKNews_62," This year, Glenn said he wants to focus on good news stories that inspire hope??and this one is definitely worth celebrating. Ocala Fire and Rescue just had its first baby delivered to their department through a safe haven baby box. Ocala launched Florida's first Safe Haven Baby Box (SHBB) in December 2020, which allows a mother in crisis to ""afely, securely, and anonymously surrender a newborn who cannot be cared for."" In its two years of operation, the Ocala safe haven box continues to be the only one of its kind in the entire state of Florida and only one of 134 SHBBs across the country. The program's aim is to fight against abortion and infant abandonment by providing mothers in crisis with a safe, anonymous way to give their babies to the proper caregivers who will ensure placement into a loving home through adoption.  In 1999, Texas became the first state to pass a ""safe haven law,"" allowing mothers to deliver their babies to a fire department or local law enforcement up to a certain age and not be prosecuted for abandonment. Now, all 50 states have adopted haven laws. Monica Kelsey founded SBHH to help facilitate mothers in crisis who want to ensure their baby's safe arrival at a ""safe haven"" while retaining anonymity.   The boxes have a side that opens to the outside of the fire department building, allowing parents to place their infant in a temperature-controlled container that immediately alerts firefighters to the baby's presence 60 seconds after they're placed inside. After two years since the Ocala fire rescue launched Florida's first SBHH, the city is celebrating the anonymous mother's courage to choose life for her baby.  In a press conference following the baby's delivery, SBHH founder Monica Kelsey said, ""We know this baby will be so loved by an adoptive family, and we are so thrilled to be a part of protecting infants from abandonment."" Kelsey started SBHH after learning that she herself was abandoned as an infant.  Ocala Mayor Kent Guinn also spoke at the conference, predicting a ""bright future"" for the ""miracle baby."" Guinn said: As Glenn said, in the midst of the onslaught of negative news in the media cycle, it's important to also focus on the good things that are happening around us. When we hear of a mother who chose life for her child over abandonment and an entire city welcomes the child with open arms??what an incredible thing to celebrate, indeed!    WRITER  Texas is under threat of a George Soros-backed takeover. Soros-funded RINO judges have been elected in some of the highest courts in Texas. These judges implemented restrictions that have blocked nearly a thousand cases of voter fraud from being investigated or prosecuted from across the state. These new restrictions are similar to ones in place in states like George, Arizona, and Wisconsin, leaving Texas more susceptible to election corruption than eve"" If Texas falls to corruption, America will lose its largest bastion of conservative electoral power in the nation. Without Texas, Republicans WILL NOT be able to win national elections and liberal corruption will go unchecked across the country.  Fortunately, there is a way to stop this: YOU. If you live in Texas you have a chance to stand up against corruption and to fight back! Starting Tuesday, February 20th, early voting for the primaries begins, where three of these judges are up for election. Go out and vote. If the right people are voted in, there's a good chance the restrictions will be lifted and election fraud can once again be prosecuted.  But remember, you can't just go in and vote for anyone who has an ""R"" next to their name. Sorors knows that a registered Democrat would never stand a chance in Texas, so his lackeys register as Republicans and ride the little ""R"" right into office. So who do you vote for?  Fortunately, Glenn had Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on his show today and Ken gave us his list of judges that he vouches for. His list is as follows:    WRITER  Who is really banning books? For years now, Conservatives have been taking flak from the left for supposed ""book bans."" The left likes to compare these ""bans"" to Nazi book burnings, accusing the right of sweeping authoritarian decrees designed to suppress information. In reality, this is a movement largely motivated by parents, who want to remove inappropriate books from children's libraries.  But if you want to discuss authoritarian book bans, look no further than the White House. As Glenn recently covered, the Biden administration has been pressuring the world's largest bookseller, Amazon, into suppressing books they disagree with. On February 5th, 2024, Ohio Representative Jim Jordan released a slew of subpoenaed documents that exposed pressure placed on Amazon by the Biden Administration. The documents, which Jordan dubbed ""The Amazon Files"" after Elon Musk's ""The Twitter Files,"" revealed an email conversation between Andrew Slavitt, a former White House senior adviser, and Amazon employees. In these emails, Slavitt complained that the top search results for books on ""vaccines"" were ""concerning"" and then requested that Amazon intervene. Amazon initially refused, not out of some altruistic concern for the free exchange of information. They thought any action taken would be ""too visible"" and would further exasperate the ??Harry/Sally narrative,?? referring to the outrage that followed Amazon's removal of Ryan T. Anderson??s book When Harry Became Sally.  Despite this initial refusal, Amazon agreed to meet with the White House a few days later. The number one item on their agenda was""oving books from the website. An Amazon employee even admitted that the reason they even took this meeting was due to the pressure being placed on them by the Biden Administration.  What was the result of this meeting? Amazon caved. They began to implement ways of limiting the outreach of books that challenged the mainstream vaccine narrative and other books the White House might not like. The White House was caught red-handed pressuring the world's largest bookseller to restrict the sale of books they consider in opposition to their narrative, and they have the gall to accuse conservatives of information suppression. This is just ONE of many actions committed by the Biden Administration that are more characteristic of a dictator than a president. What can you do about it? Fortunately, you are not dependent on Amazon and its corrupted algorithm to help you find books. Every week right here on GlennBeck.com, we highlight books that Glenn is reading or talking about in our ""Glenn's Bookshelf"" series. Here you can find a wide selection of books free from Amazon's filters. Be sure to sign up for Glenn's newsletter to find out about new additions to ""Glenn's Bookshelf"" every week.    WRITER   The left-wing media's most recent tirade is accusing Trump of being a dictator. But, as Glenn said, ""Everything they're accusing us of, they're doing."" Since day one, the Biden administration has overstepped the bounds placed on the executive branch set by the Constitution. In Glenn's most recent TV Special, he examined ten times Biden acted like a dictator, NOT a president. Here are 10 of Biden's Dictator Moves, and click HERE to get ALL of the research that went into this week's Glenn TV special:     WRITER   Every day it seems Glenn covers another story revealing how people across the world at all levels of power DESPISE the fact that YOU have rights, and they are actively trying to curtail them. Recently, there has been a string of attacks against the rights outlined in the First Amendment: the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, the freedom of assembly, and the freedom to petition. As a refresher, the First Amendment reads as follows: This is powerful stuff, there is a good reason the Founding Fathers made it the FIRST Amendment. It's also the reason why power-hungry elites are attacking it. These attacks are designed to control the way you think, speak, and believe, vote, what you read, and who holds your representatives responsible. The First Amendment is our strongest weapon against tyrants, and they know it. So what can you do about it? Hope that some wig in Washinton will eventually do something? We know how well that works. The best thing to do is to stay active, engage in the issues you care about, and exercise your rights.  So where to start? Here are a few things YOU can do to protect your First Amendment rights:                                Religion                                   The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is toyou guessed itpractice your faith. Become an active member in your place of worship, go to scripture studies, invite your friends to that late afternoon event, and walk the life. This can impact the way you spend money as well. Shop the businesses and brands that share your values, and don't shop at the ones that scorn them. Keeping the community alive and healthy is the best way to ensure that generations to come will be able to experience the freedom you enjoy.                              Speech                                   Much like religion, the best way to protect your freedom of speech is... to speak. Engage your friends and family in polite, civil conversation. Stand up for what you believe in, and make your case to your peers. Just remember to keep it friendly. No one ever won an argument by shouting down their opponent. The civil exchange of ideas is the cornerstone of our republic, and a dialogue where the participants are well-informed, considerate, compassionate, and open-minded can have permanent impacts on all involved.                              Press                                   Freedom of the Press seems a little tricky at first. Unless you work for the media, what are you supposed to do? Quit your job and go work for the local newspaper? The good news is that exercising this right is not nearly that difficult. In fact, you are currently doing it. The best thing you can do is to read from outlets that produce informative content. Want to know what Glenn consumes to stay informed every day?

Assembly                                    Anna Moneymaker / Staff | Getty ImagesFreedom of assembly is one of the more impactful yet underutilized freedoms in the First Amendment. Peaceably assembling and protesting with like-minded individuals can hugely influence politicians and policies while simultaneously creating community and fellowship between attendees. It's understandable why more people don't turn out. We're all busy people with busy schedules, and flying out to D.C. for the weekend seems like a daunting task to many. Thankfully, you don't have to go out all the way to D.C. to make a difference. Gather some like-minded people in your town and bring awareness to issues that impact your community. Big change starts locally, and exercising your freedom to assemble can be the catalyst to lasting impact.                               Petition                                   If you've been a long-time listener of Glenn, then you will have heard a few of his calls to action where he asks his audience to contact their representatives about a particular piece of policy. There is a good reason Glenn keeps on doing those: they work. Whether it's your local mayor or your senator, a call and an email go a long way. If you really want to make a change, convince your friends and family to reach out as well. The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is to??you guessed it??practice your faith.

BECKNews_63," Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) has come a long way since she told then-2020 presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke ""Hell, no, you??re not""taking her guns in response to O'Rourke's viral ""hell yes"" comment about proposed firearm confiscation plans.  Now, we find out that Boebert was a stripper and a paid escort, had a ""meth drug problem,"" nearly ""killed her sister-in-law during a drunk driving"" accident, and somehow had an abortion five or so months before giving birth to her son. Oh, wait, no. Those were all lies, and the guy who peddled them ?? American Muckrakers PAC co-founder David Wheeler ?? admitted to CNN that his ""mbshell"" expos?? on Rep. Boebert was chock full of ""naccuracies.""  Wheeler also offered to apologize to Boebert, but on ""The Glenn Beck Program"" Thursday, the Republican congresswoman told Glenn that it looks like that was a lie too. ""I don't really mind that they hate me,"" Boebert said of her left-wing defamers. ""It actually lets me know that I'm on the right track, because they cannot stand the truth ... [and] they hate anything that is good about America. So, whenever they come after me, I'm like, 'alright, we're doing good.'"" Asked by Glenn about Wheeler's absolutely outrageous lies, many of which went viral on Twitter last month, Boebert said, ""They cannot attack me personally enough ... they've always stretched it too far and now they just completely make it up. They completely fabricate it. There were lies saying [she had] two terminated pregnancies, I was an escort, a stripper, an addict, all sorts of things. And, you know, people get tired of it ... it really discredits anything they're trying to do because it's so out of touch. But that's all right. We'll have my lawyers handle that one.""  After CNN called the Democratic super PAC co-founder out on his ""inaccuracies,"" Wheeler ""conceded: [T]he super PAC was wrong when it insisted a photo of another woman posing on a bed is a photo of Boebert, was wrong when it claimed Boebert initially failed to disclose a campaign contribution from Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, was wrong to suggest Cruz had made big contributions to Boebert's campaign immediately after she started running in her first primary, was wrong about the date of a Boebert vehicle accident, and was wrong when it published a claim that Boebert had an abortion ""in the fall of 2004'""- at most six months before she gave birth to a son in March 2005. Wheeler also told CNN that he would be willing to apologize, but according to Boebert, ""he doubles down on a daily basis."" ""[Wheeler] stands by his claims [and] stands by his anonymous sources,"" she said. ""This is not something that he's backing down from, and frankly, neither am I.""

BECKNews_64," President Bidens State of the Union takes place tonight, but Joe likely wont touch on what could be the biggest story facing us all: The tech revolution that is changing our lives FOREVER. In this clip, Glenn details how artificial intelligence (AI), and new technological developments not only will fundamentally transform our lives, but could put our free will and our freedom at risk as well. Especially since, Glenn says, global elites are the ones running and designing these machines&    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: But the State of the Union, what is on -- what is at stake now, is your free will. Your right to choose. To charge your own course. To know the truth. Be able to find the truth.But everything is crumbling.We are in a time of deep -- dematerialization. Everything is being destroyed, and it is also being replaced with to my knowledge content.You used to own movies. Maybe you would rent them. But you would have a physical copy. Same with music. Now everything is a subscription. You don't have any real objects.And machines are being able now to re-create what we do, in seconds. Since the dawn of time, we've always been greater than machines. Because we are born. We are created by a grand creator. Machines are made.We belong to God, to nature, to biology. But machines belong to us. We're their designers.But the division now is starting to fade. And those who are in elite positions know this. And those who are in elite positions are designing the machines.We are becoming more and more engineered by the system. While the machines are becoming more biological. More natural. More human.Artificial and mechanical things are becoming more lifelike, to the point, soon, we will not know what consciousness is. We will not be able to define life, because we can't define it now.And the more realistic things become, the less control we have over them.They gain freedom. At our expense. The expense of our own.See, in this case, we are the creator. When it comes to AI. When it comes to what is really facing us, and that's not tax policy. That's not even about the balloon.All the things that will be discussed tonight, it has nothing really to do that. There is a much larger play on stage.And no one is talking about it. We have entered the age now, where it is here. We are creating artificial intelligence, which will eventually tell us, it is artificial life. And we are the creator. And will our creation turn on us?Have we turned on our creator? Rebelled against our creator?Will we endow our creation with inalienable rights?Will we be just creators? And will they be loving creations? Or will they grow arrogant? And grow -- and go their own way. See, unlike us, they actually will know more than their creator, very soon.We right now, are destroying our creator. Why would they not destroy theirs? Especially since their DNA or algorithm has man's worse destructive advice written into it. Think about what is being written into their algorithms. Think about how it is destroying our society, and humanity.These are not the angels among us, that are writing this code. Technology has always led us to freedom, but the technology is gaining its own life now. Google just announced today, or yesterday, that it is releasing its own creation. A rival to ChatGPT, the -- the system that just wrote the bard, and just wrote Edgar Allan Poe.Except, this one has all of the information of the internet. Well, my question is: Is it connected to the connected?Is it connected to the internet?Is this infant? See, this is why our searches have always been free. Because at Google, you were the product. Google's goal as has been from the beginning, to create the human brain. AI to AGI, and eventually to ASI, Artificial Super Intelligence.And Hollywood depicts the future, like the Terminator, and that's what's so insidious about real life. Because you don't realize, Skynet is already here. It's in China.That's what the Chinese actually named their computer systems and AI, that watches and gathers everything, on everyone. Skynet.But it's not that obvious. Just like people think the Antichrist. Oh, he's going to be obvious. No. Uh-uh.Do you know the central Bank of England, and his majesty's Treasury announced yesterday, that an announcement about the unveiling of their new digital currency, is coming soon?Complete control, digital control of all of your money. Of all of your life.All part of what will be a global system.All digitally connected. The next generation will be born into the world of AI. Boston dynamics. I don't know if you've been seeing their robots Atlas, and what they can do. But they can do just about anything. The Pentagon announced last week, that they're now working on concepts of a drone and droid army.It wouldn't be a surprise, if the AI generation, the kids that are alive today, have a backward notion of what it means to be human.Already. A lot of people confuse rights and freedom, and desire.Or worse, empowerment. They demand things like the right to equal pay. Without even understanding the freedom for leisure, the right to employment, the right to abortions, the right to a free education, or free health care or free anything. But none of these things have anything to do with freedom. Do you think we'll actually be talking about the principles of freedom, and what's really at stake tonight, at the State of the Union?People don't even realize that rebellion, without an understanding of freedom, will lead to enslavement.Freedom is really simple. It's about staying active in the world. But it's also about honoring your neighbor.It's about making your own decisions. To have our own thoughts and feelings. But also to respect everyone's own privacy. I don't have a right to your thoughts.This is why Adam Smith placed freedom at the head, and the heart of capitalism.But if you don't have freedom, is there capitalism?If digital currencies and AI begin to be our masters, it won't be with chains. It will be with something we're already suffering from. A total lack of meaning.Now, here's the good news, freedom is bigger and stronger than all processing power. Our freedom was created by God. Any restriction our freedom, is an attack on God.And why should God and freedom be such separate ideas? That shouldn't be. But that's how it's gotten. Because we have forgotten that we are not the creator. We too, are created.And the big check giants are acting like God from the time of Babel. They control the language. And we are the people that are barely understanding each other.This selfish reality, that we are in right now, is the opposite of freedom. And the way to protect our freedom, is to see who we really fight. Can we name our enemy first?Republicans will say Democrats. Democrats will say Republicans. Independents will say both of you.I would say, all of us. All of us. We're all arguing about the wrong things.Tonight, we will make fun of the State of the Union. And we will do an expert -- very highly paid job. We will do -- we will do the hard work. We're willing to shoulder those jokes at the expense of our president.But we have to band together on bigger ideas. Because it's not the president. It's not the party. It's entire institutions. It is a state of mind, that comes from the world economic forum. Which want to crowd us together, so the elites can stretch their legs and recline.We have got to learn. When we to learn, that there are more of us that are fighting for freedom, than them.And we have to wake up our neighbors. They're trying to convince us all the time, that their power is our freedom. Not at all. They're not interested in our freedom.They want the power. And it's the same story with every revolution. And this revolution, the revolution of AI, which is being digitized and written by the elites is no different. That's why they're trying to liberate us from our churches, our families. Our -- our traditions, our history.Our local communities. They're liberating us from those things. They want us to believe that freedom is the result of more government. More centralization. More bureaucracy.More corporations in our life, with things that we can rent or buy from them.Once we realize, that this is not true. And we also look at tech, that is being used by them, right now. To silence and to shape, and eventually to enslave.We win. And we rescue our freedom.But we need to put priorities together, first.   The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy people on the left. The AOC's have taken over, places in the media.And places like this in New York.This is what it is thousand. So there's been one case. One. One in the entire seven years. Where they did this.Where they shut down a company, that had no obvious victims.The case was 1972.And it was a company, relatively small company, that was writing term papers, for college students. Okay.So I want to write my paper.GLENN: I want to break out in God bless America.STU: Capitalism is pretty impressive. Apparently, this didn't go over that well.What they said, there were no obvious victims here. The people bought the term papers. They didn't want to write them. They got the term papers. They said, they were defrauding the education system.GLENN: Which they were.STU: This is the one time. And it's a small tiny company. Let me give you the other times they've done this.Tell me if any of these sound like, hey, I have a good interest rate, on a loan I paid back.Number one, a breast cancer nonprofit was shut down a dozen years ago. For using nearly all its $9 million in donations to pay for director's salaries, perks, and other expenses, instead of funding free mammograms. Okay.So they told everyone, donate money for free. Mammograms. And they just took all the money for themselves.That's number one. Number two, a private equity timber.Faking big investment success, was closed down after stealing millions of dollars from thousands of investors.Okay?You can see.GLENN: Yeah. Got it. But on both of those so far, you have hundreds of thousands of people, you know, I'm sure. That gave -- they're all victims.They gave their money.STU: Yeah. And they didn't get the thing that they want.GLENN: They didn't get the thing they were promised. You have all these people going to the AG. Saying, hey, this is a real problem here. This has to stop. Not here.GLENN: Not here.STU: Another one. Mental health facility, shuttered for looting $4 million from public funds, while neglecting patients.GLENN: Okay. Kind of a big one.STU: Pretty clear. An auto lender that allegedly charged hidden interest rates, got to stay in business last year if it paid a fine and didn't commit fraud in the future.So here's one they didn't shut down.They actually let them go on.They're going after Trump in all of this. In this one, they're like, oh. Sure, they're hidden fees.They're not telling you about them.GLENN: Okay.STU: A judge requested.A judge refused to request to shut down a river rafting company in 2011.After a customer drowned, and the attorney general showed it was repeatedly using unlicensed guides, or none at all.Instead, he ordered only a 50,000-dollar bond and cleanup -- for him to clean up his act.The company is still being run today, under a different name by the same family. Someone died.GLENN: We have thousands of victims.And in this case, somebody who is dead.STU: Is dead!GLENN: Dead!STU: They're like, you guys can stay open -- and then this one is my favorite one. A judge in 2001.Declined to appoint a receiver, to take over a porn site, despite millions of dollars of illegal credit card charges to hundreds of customers.Who thought they were getting a free tour.Now, look, you're -- you want to get the free -- you want to know what you're subscribing for, Glenn. Before you just pulled the trigger on that. So you put your credit card information into a porn site, I think some of these victims need some life changes to be made here.But they put their credit card into a porn site. Expecting a free tour.They instead, get charged and charged and charged and charged.In fact, once the owners of the site were caught, they attempted to move their money overseas, to avoid any penalty.Still, the judge said, appointing a receiver was an extraordinary remedy!That should be used sparingly, and that a preliminary injunction was good enough.Only after all that happened, it they find out, the people running the porn site, were the Gambino crime family.(laughter)I kid you not. The Gambino crime family.GLENN: And they didn't go into receivership.STU: So there you go. Thi",-6,-7,
BECKNews_65," 	CEO/Founder   The polls are not looking too hot for Democrats lately. Even AOC got heckled recently  in her own district. Dr. Oz is gaining on Fetterman. Kari Lake is pulling away from Katie Hobbs. Herschel Walker is neck and neck with Warnock. Even the New York Times conceded on October 17 that the GOP is steadily making serious gains. And maybe one of the funniest things in all of politics and the mainstream media is that almost none of them can figure out why. Theyre seriously dumbfounded. But I think a lot of us that dont live among the coastal elites can actually empathize with their political confusion. We are likewise confused, but not on why the Left is so unpopular right now. Were confused over what they actually stand for. Weve got no clue what they are fighting to achieve. Well, outside pure raw power. But the means by which theyre trying to achieve it makes no sense.    For one, there's the buzzword EQUALITY. We already have equal opportunity. Whether it be race, gender, sexual orientation  those fights have already been fought and won. I saw a TikTok the other day of a liberal teacher bragging that she passes out pride flags every day to all of her students. She said she was doing it so that every day is a Pride Parade. Umm & why? What is this a stand against? What rights do those in the LGBTQ community not have?  Why is there a left-wing cult for climate change? Why is there another left-wing cult that really wants to make sure people can kill babies with no restrictions? It almost sounds as if todays Democrat figureheads dont even know the why for all the things theyre so outraged over. Almost as if they were handed some talking points from the 1960s and are trying to pretend we still live in the civil rights era. Now, I want you to think about that, and then listen to this interview of Stacey Abrams recently on MSNBC: Maybe Im old-fashioned, but never in all my years did I ever think Id hear a major American political party declare the answer to inflation would be to kill your kids. Maybe thats just me. Stacey Abrams is clearly an idiot, but I think I kind of get where the stupidity originates from. I dont think she or any of the other up-and-coming Democrats today truly believes any of the crap theyre spewing. Theyre using it all to try to gain power. Theyre sowing hatred and rage, but they have no clue where all of this came from. Theyre just skimming the talking points that have been handed down to them over the past 50 years or so. But do they actually understand any of it? I dont think so. And how could they? As I pointed out before, these are fights that have already been fought. These are fights that other people, in many cases, have already won. And maybe the greatest example of this is Staceys wacked-out statement on abortion and inflation. If you Google the words abortion and inflation together in the same search, you might possibly stumble upon a Planned Parenthood memo from 1969. The memo was authored by a Planned Parenthood vice president regarding Activities Relevant to the Study of Population Policy for the United States. You see, long before the cult of climate change, progressives were all on board the cult of population control. American eugenicists were respected by progressives and tyrants all over the world, and Planned Parenthood was ground zero for the entire movement. This memo not only reads like a script from a horror movie, but it reveals what leftists truly stand for ?? whether they remember or know about the origins or not. I??m going to highlight quotes directly from the memo. This first part is directly from the first page: So right off the bat it makes you wonder.""s the abortion movement truly concerned with womens rights? Or was it really all about a post-apocalyptic strategy to control population?  It appears they believed that American families were to blame & but not all families were always the focus of proponents of population control. Take a look at exactly which families they wanted to control the sizes of. They looked to: Minorities and the poor. Supposedly the people the Left claims to care about, right? Kind of makes you wonder about LBJs true motivations behind his War on Poverty, doesnt it? It makes you wonder why the REAL effects of the ensuing massive welfare state ended up making people poorer and breaking up families. Interesting coincidence. The memo goes on to mention that a mass wave of contraceptive handouts was the preferred method. But I find this part interesting: Abortion on demand wasnt even the main plan. It was the BACKUP. But I thought it was all about womens rights? Now, heres where we get to Stacey Abrams weird comment about inflation and abortion. This memo actually references inflation: Aaaand a lot to unpack there ... For one, they wanted women in the workforce ?? not for equal opportunity, but because employed women tended not to have as many babies. But they thought all those women getting jobs might spike inflation. So it was something they figured they??d have to measure. The party of virtue!  The memo also came with an attachment that listed other measures proposed by population control experts. It was never said that any of these were actual plans by Planned Parenthood. But check out some of these ??proposed measures??: These are just a few, and it gets nuttier and nuttier. Again, there??s nothing to suggest Planned Parenthood had any plans to do any of this, but it shows the lengths population control academics were willing to go to. Fertility control ag""n the water supply?! Are you kidding? How many current Democratic flag-bearing issues can you spot just in this memo? ??Compulsory education of children??: How many of us have wondered why they??re pushing so hard on our kids lately? Why are they ramming sexually explicit Comprehensive Sexuality Education into our schools? ??Encourage increased homosexuality??: What is the LGBTQ lobby still fighting over? Didn??t it already win? Why are people hyper-sexualizing kids and exposing them to drag queens in schools and libraries?  ??Educate for family limitation??: Who has wondered why they are shouting to ??destroy the nuclear family??? ??Encourage women to work??: Isn??t workplace gender discrimination illegal? So what??s that fight really all about? And regarding the ??education?? they keep referencing for both kids and families, check out this quote from the full memo: The admission here is insane. Indoctrination ?? they admit ?? has its bonuses ... especially for imposing "" on poor people.   WRITER  Texas is under threat of a George Soros-backed takeover. Soros-funded RINO judges have been elected in some of the highest courts in Texas. These judges implemented restrictions that have blocked nearly a thousand cases of voter fraud from being investigated or prosecuted from across the state. These new restrictions are similar to ones in place in states like George, Arizona, and Wisconsin, leaving Texas more susceptible to election corruption than ever. If Texas falls to corruption, America will lose its largest bastion of conservative electoral power in the nation. Without Texas, Republicans WILL NOT be able to win national elections and liberal corruption will go unchecked across the country.  Fortunately, there is a way to stop this: YOU. If you live in Texas you have a chance to stand up against corruption and to fight back! Starting Tuesday, February 20th, early voting for the primaries begins, where three of these judges are up for election. Go out and vote. If the right people are voted in, there's a good chance the restrictions will be lifted and election fraud can once again be prosecuted.  But remember, you can't just go in and vote for anyone who has an ""R"" next to their name. Sorors knows that a registered Democrat would never stand a chance in Texas, so his lackeys register as Republicans and ride the little ""R"" right into office. So who do you vote for?  Fortunately, Glenn had Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on his show today and Ken gave us his list of judges that he vouches for. His list is as follows:    WRITER  Who is really banning books? For years now, Conservatives have been taking flak from the left for supposed ""book bans."" The left likes to compare these ""bans"" to Nazi book burnings, accusing the right of sweeping authoritarian decrees designed to suppress information. In reality, this is a movement largely motivated by parents, who want to remove inappropriate books from children's libraries.  But if you want to discuss authoritarian book bans, look no further than the White House. As Glenn recently covered, the Biden administration has been pressuring the world's largest bookseller, Amazon, into suppressing books they disagree with. On February 5th, 2024, Ohio Representative Jim Jordan released a slew of subpoenaed documents that exposed pressure placed on Amazon by the Biden Administration. The documents, which Jordan dubbed ""The Amazon Files"" after Elon Musk's ""The Twitter Files,"" revealed an email conversation between Andrew Slavitt, a former White House senior adviser, and Amazon employees. In these emails, Slavitt complained that the top search results for books on ""vaccines"" were ""concerning"" and then requested that Amazon intervene. Amazon initially refused, not out of some altruistic concern for the free exchange of information. They thought any action taken would be ""too visible"" and would further exasperate the ??Harry/Sally narrative,?? referring to the outrage that followed Amazon's removal of Ryan T. Anderson??s book When Harry Became Sally.  Despite this initial refusal, Amazon agreed to meet with the White House a few days later. The number one item on their agenda was""oving books from the website. An Amazon employee even admitted that the reason they even took this meeting was due to the pressure being placed on them by the Biden Administration.  What was the result of this meeting? Amazon caved. They began to implement ways of limiting the outreach of books that challenged the mainstream vaccine narrative and other books the White House might not like. The White House was caught red-handed pressuring the world's largest bookseller to restrict the sale of books they consider in opposition to their narrative, and they have the gall to accuse conservatives of information suppression. This is just ONE of many actions committed by the Biden Administration that are more characteristic of a dictator than a president. What can you do about it? Fortunately, you are not dependent on Amazon and its corrupted algorithm to help you find books. Every week right here on GlennBeck.com, we highlight books that Glenn is reading or talking about in our ""Glenn's Bookshelf"" series. Here you can find a wide selection of books free from Amazon's filters. Be sure to sign up for Glenn's newsletter to find out about new additions to ""Glenn's Bookshelf"" every week.    WRITER   The left-wing media's most recent tirade is accusing Trump of being a dictator. But, as Glenn said, ""Everything they're accusing us of, they're doing."" Since day one, the Biden administration has overstepped the bounds placed on the executive branch set by the Constitution. In Glenn's most recent TV Special, he examined ten times Biden acted like a dictator, NOT a president. Here are 10 of Biden's Dictator Moves, and click HERE to get ALL of the research that went into this week's Glenn TV special:     WRITER   Every day it seems Glenn covers another story revealing how people across the world at all levels of power DESPISE the fact that YOU have rights, and they are actively trying to curtail them. Recently, there has been a string of attacks against the rights outlined in the First Amendment: the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, the freedom of assembly, and the freedom to petition. As a refresher, the First Amendment reads as follows: This is powerful stuff, there is a good reason the Founding Fathers made it the FIRST Amendment. It's also the reason why power-hungry elites are attacking it. These attacks are designed to control the way you think, speak, and believe, vote, what you read, and who holds your representatives responsible. The First Amendment is our strongest weapon against tyrants, and they know it. So what can you do about it? Hope that some wig in Washinton will eventually do something? We know how well that works. The best thing to do is to stay active, engage in the issues you care about, and exercise your rights.  So where to start? Here are a few things YOU can do to protect your First Amendment rights:                                Religion                                   The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is to??you guessed it??practice your faith. Become an active member in your place of worship, go to scripture studies, invite your friends to that late afternoon event, and walk the life. This can impact the way you spend money as well. Shop the businesses and brands that share your values, and don't shop at the ones that scorn them. Keeping the community alive and healthy is the best way to ensure that generations to come will be able to experience the freedom you enjoy.                              Speech                                   Much like religion, the best way to protect your freedom of speech is... to speak. Engage your friends and family in polite, civil conversation",-7,-7,
BECKNews_66," A Chinese balloon was spotted over the northern United States earlier this week, with sightings most recently in Billings, Montana. China has since confirmed the suspected spy balloon is theirs, though stopped short of admitting its being used for surveillance (like many in the U.S. suspect). According to CNN, military officials advised President Joe Biden NOT to destroy the balloon, due to fear the debris could pose a safety threat to people on the ground. But in this clip, Glenn explains why NOT destroying this 'spy balloon' could be a very BIG mistake&    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Let me talk to you about the spy balloon. Stu, what do you know about the spy balloon?STU: Well, apparently, the spy balloon, flying from a product of China. Flying from our western United States.GLENN: Yeah. It's over Wyoming.STU: Alaska. Wyoming now.GLENN: Yeah. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.STU: I did have a question of, when we have satellites and TikTok, why would we need a balloon? I don't know.GLENN: It does seem to be a little old-timey, you know.And at first when I heard that, I thought, they're down to hot air balloons. That's good. You know, that's good. But it's not good.And here's why: And I'm not hearing anybody talk about this. First of all, the -- the balloon's current path, it carries -- it carries this balloon over a number of sensitive military sites. And they also say -- the United States says, they don't want to shoot it out of the sky because of falling debris. Really? We don't have anything that would just obliterate that thing in the sky. Really? So, anyway, it was over Canada. And then it flies into the United States. And it's flying over sensitive military nuclear sites.And the Chinese foreign ministry said, you know, relax, America.Now, I don't know about you, but I'm -- China should be happy that we don't have a female for president. Because females don't really like it when males say, okay. Sweetheart, relax.And I think that's kind of what China just said to us, in a very condescending tone. Oh, please, relax. It's just a spy balloon. What are we going to get?Well, here's the one thing that -- one thing that I -- that I wanted to check, when I saw this.The -- the balloon, they think, is in an altitude between 80, and 120,000 feet. Now, I'm not saying, that this is what it is.But I am saying, if we don't shoot it down, and make sure that our own airspace remains sacred, we're out of our minds. Can you imagine Russia. If we had a spy balloon, ask we told Russia or China, ah, relax.The balloon is at an altitude, they believe between 80 and 120,000 feet. The minimum altitude for an airborne EMP is 94 or 95,000 feet. So that's right in that range. I just want to throw that out there.I don't think it's an EMP. In fact, I'm pretty sure it's not an EMP. However, if they can fly things over our country. And we do nothing about it.And they're flying them over our nuclear sites. I think that's a problem.I don't know about anybody else.But I'm not really relaxed about it. How about you? Hmm?STU: Sounds like a big problem. And, you know, certainly, I think, they will learn, that they can do this, if they want to do it. Right?GLENN: Yeah. Absolutely.STU: Take a lesson from this.GLENN: That's the intelligence that they're gathering.I really believe, they are gathering the intelligence of, will America even respond?I don't think they will. No. Of course, they will. No. I don't think they will.Let's fly it over. Fly it into US airspace. And fly it spew their really sensitive military sites. And see if they say a word. No!That's the intelligence they're gathering.STU: That's all we do, though. Is we say the word. They're talking about how they're going to make a very uncomfortable meeting, I guess when I guess Blinken meets with them.GLENN: Oh, very uncomfortable.We might send them a sternly worded letter. Why not blow it out of the sky? Sincerely. Why not blow it out of the sky.Just saying.If it's a balloon, I'm not so worried about shrapnel coming down. Are you?STU: Well, looking it though, the pictures that are seemingly of this balloon. It doesn't look like a balloon. Like you would think of a balloon.It looks like there's a decent amount of equipment on it. How would you describe this picture? It looks almost like a satellite.GLENN: Almost like Sputnik.(laughter)Yeah. So it looks kind of like a satellite. I wonder what equipment might be on it. And honestly, there is nothing that a balloon can gather, that I'm aware of. And I talked to some expert about this. There's nothing I'm aware of, that they can't gather very satellite. They can watch us via satellite, they have that technology. So why launch a balloon?The only answer I and others can come up, that I've talked to. Is they're just testing, whether or not they can invade our airspace. And we do anything. Now, why would they want to know that? This is not good. It's not good. GLENN: Just saying. Leave it at that.STU: Your summary of it, do we get a headline out of it? Is that a clickbait-y headline that we can get?GLENN: Yeah. China flying mysterious balloons with equipment on it, over sensitive US air -- US sites. Suboptimal.STU: Yeah.GLENN: Suboptimal. I'm just saying.STU: Suboptimal.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: Emphasis on the sub.GLENN: Yeah. Which they can launch a lot of things.Anyway, there is a new poll out, and it's a record-setting poll. And I think this is exciting. Only about a third. 36 percent of Americans, say they are satisfied now, with a set of policy issues spanning all aspects of government.Among the lowest rated issues was the state of the economy. Which our president said, is fixed right? I mean, it's booming.STU: It's strong as hell, Glenn. GLENN: Strong as hell. No joke, people. I'm not joking. I'm telling you the truth. I'm shooting straight. It's strong as hell. A quarter of Americans say, yeah. I'm satisfied with it.It had the largest year over year decline, dropping eight percentage points.Satisfaction with gun laws, also dropped sharply this year, to a record low of 34 percent.Now, this one, I would like you to look into, Stu. I would like you to know. Is that like, yeah. Our gun laws aren't strong enough.You know, we have to be more like California. Which, well, don't think about the stats on that one, too much.Because we already have the toughest gun laws in California. But that's because of other states, that we're having all these problems.Uh-huh. So the satisfaction of gun laws dropped sharply to a record low. Policies on abortion. Efforts to control crime.Quality of public education. And efforts to combat poverty and homelessness, also remain at near all-time low points.So we're not in a good mood. Now, they say, there are things we can build on.Sure, there's a rise of polarization. And a decline in national harmony.You know, we've always had a baseline, where, you know, people were generally content with America.And now, people are not. I wonder what could have changed that.So the perception of overall quality of life in the US has dropped to a record low this year.As did perceptions of wealth inequality. Less than a quarter of adults now say that they are satisfied the way income and wealth is distributed in the US.Less than a quarter of adults. So does that mean only a quarter of us believe in the free market?STU: Is it that high?GLENN: Is it that high?STU: I mean, think about that, you are constantly beaten over the head, with how much this country sucks. How terrible it's been. How everything it does is wrong. How every police officer is out to kill minorities. I mean, it's on and on and on.How every rich person is trying to kill poor people for profit. Every company is out to get you.You think about how that has to wash over a population over multiple decades, and what other ending can you come to? Only if people are hard-core their principles.GLENN: Yeah, they know that. They hard-core know that. And just when you think that things are horrible, the groundhog dies, on Groundhog Day. It's suboptimal. I'm going to leave it at that.    The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy people on the left. The AOC's have taken over, places in the media.And places like this in New York.This is what it is thousand. So there's been one case. One. One in the entire seven years. Where they did this.Where they shut down a company, that had no obvious victims.The case was 1972.And it was a company, relatively small company, that was writing term papers, for college students. Okay.So I want to write my paper.GLENN: I want to break out in God bless America.STU: Capitalism is pretty impressive. Apparently, this didn't go over that well.What they said, there were no obvious victims here. The people bought the term papers. They didn't want to write them. They got the term papers. They said, they were defrauding the education system.GLENN: Which they were.STU: This is the one time. And it's a small tiny company. Let me give you the other times they've done this.Tell me if any of these sound like, hey, I have a good interest rate, on a loan I paid back.Number one, a breast cancer nonprofit was shut down a dozen years ago. For using nearly all its $9 million in donations to pay for director's salaries, perks, and other expenses, instead of funding free mammograms. Okay.So they told everyone, donate money for free. Mammograms. And they just took all the money for themselves.That's number one. Number two, a private equity timber.Faking big investment success, was closed down after stealing millions of dollars from thousands of investors.Okay?You can see.GLENN: Yeah. Got it. But on both of those so far, you have hundreds of thousands of people, you know, I'm sure. That gave -- they're all victims.They gave their money.STU: Yeah. And they didn't get the thing that they want.GLENN: They didn't get the thing they were promised. You have all these people going to the AG. Saying, hey, this is a real problem here. This has to stop. Not here.GLENN: Not here.STU: Another one. Mental health facility, shuttered for looting $4 million from public funds, while neglecting patients.GLENN: Okay. Kind of a big one.STU: Pretty clear. An auto lender that allegedly charged hidden interest rates, got to stay in business last year if it paid a fine and didn't commit fraud in the future.So here's one they didn't shut down.They actually let them go on.They're going after Trump in all of this. In this one, they're like, oh. Sure, they're hidden fees.They're not telling you about them.GLENN: Okay.STU: A judge requested.A judge refused to request to shut down a river rafting company in 2011.After a customer drowned, and the attorney general showed it was repeatedly using unlicensed guides, or none at all.Instead, he ordered only a 50,000-dollar bond and cleanup -- for him to clean up his act.The company is still being run today, under a different name by the same family. Someone died.GLENN: We have thousands of victims.And in this case, somebody who is dead.STU: Is dead!GLENN: Dead!STU: They're like, you guys can stay open -- and then this one is my favorite one. A judge in 2001.Declined to appoint a receiver, to take over a porn site, despite millions of dollars of illegal credit card charges to hundreds of customers.Who thought they were getting a free tour.Now, look, you're -- you want to get the free -- you want to know what you're subscribing for, Glenn. Before you just pulled the trigger on that. So you put your credit card information into a porn site, I think some of these victims need some life changes to be made here.But they put their credit card into a porn site. Expecting a free tour.They instead, get charged and charged and charged and charged.In fact, once the owners of the site were caught, they attempted to move their money overseas, to avoid any penalty.Still, the judge said, appointing a receiver was an extraordinary remedy!That should be used sparingly, and that a preliminary injunction was good enough.Only after all that happened, it they find out, the people running the porn site, were the Gambino crime family.(laughter)I kid you not. The Gambino crime family.GLENN: And they didn't go into receivership.STU: So there you go. Thi",0,1,
BECKNews_67," It seems like there continues to be very little ideological overlap between Republicans and Democrats. Yet, a recent New York Times poll found that midterm voters DO agree on one thing. The poll found that 85 percent of participants agree on one, specific danger to American democracy. In this clip, Glenn and Stu reveal that danger, and they discuss some of the the poll's other, shocking results&    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Let me talk to you a little bit about, let me tell you about the voting data. There is some new actual data, the turnout is pretty big for early voting.  STU: Incredible.  GLENN: Yeah.  STU: I would say.  GLENN: Incredible. Because we're comparing this now to a presidential election. Democrats, 57 percent in California, in 2020, 57 percent at this point was the balance of the, that we're coming in.  STU: The ballots that were coming in from registered democrats.  GLENN: 22 percent from registered Republicans. This time, 49 percent are from democrats and 27 percent are from Republicans. This doesn't mean anything other than, I mean, I think that Republicans are less likely to vote early, usually.  STU: Oh yes. Absolutely. We've had candidates encouraging them not to. More democrats are always encouraged to get out there, get that vote in early.   GLENN: Correct.  STU: There's advantages to campaigns for doing this. Not only do you get the vote locked in you also don't have to spend resources getting that person out on that day. It's a massive advantage to get your people to vote early.  GLENN: Florida 57 democrat at this time in 2020. Today it is 42 percent. That's down 9 percentage points. The last time, for Republicans, Florida, 29 percent, this time 39 percent. So the spread is what interests me. You're a guy who loves stats. Does that spread mean anything?  STU: It means something but it's important to not put too much into it. Early voting data has has been known to be misleading when you're trying to draw grand conclusions from it.  GLENN: I'm only drawing from that we are more than that are, we are more motivated to go out and vote than they are. And if that continues all the way through, that a really good sign.  STU: That would be a great sign.  GLENN: Yeah.  STU: Again, it's just early. I think you can take this an indication that something might be happening it's a point of data.  GLENN: There's another poll from the New York Times, New York Times poll, asked its respondents to select one of the two following statements that is aligning closest to your view even if they don't match exactly. American democracy is currently under threat. American democracy is not currently under threat. 71 percent say we are under threat, 21 percent say no. The poll then took the 71 percent who thought it was under threat and said where is the threat coming from? Republicans major threat, 28 percent minor threat, 39, not a threat, 29. So the Republicans are a threat to the republic. Major threat 28, minor threat 39. Democrats are a real threat. Major threat, 33, minor threat 30, not a threat, 34 percent. Not a threat for democrat oar or for Republicans was 29.  STU: So basically about equal.  GLENN: Yes.  STU: Both sides are saying the other are threats.  GLENN: Yes.  STU: Which shouldn't surprise you.  GLENN: No.  STU: But you need to read into this a little further.  GLENN: Save that because I want to give you the rest. Donald Trump, major threat 45 percent, minor threat 22, not a threat 31. Joe Biden, major threat 38, minor threat 22, not a threat 37. So not that far off of Donald Trump. Isn't that interesting? Mainstream media, major threat, 59 percent, minor threat 25, not a threat 15 percent. That's incredible.  STU: Yeah, this is a reallying narrative that's developed over the past month or two which is the democrats believed, looking at polling like this, that so many people thought democracy was in trouble. That if they ran on January 6, people would run to them. There's not a, it's not a insane viewpoint from their view.  GLENN: No.  STU: We saw what happened on January 6, people didn't like it, they think democracy's in trouble, let's build that up and have these hearings in prime time, let's launch the hearings when we have nothing, let's make everything about Donald Trump. It's understandable.  GLENN: I think 2008 that would have been absolutely the thing to do and would have won. But because we had gone through a year of setting cities on fire with nothing  STU: In 2008?  GLENN: In 2008, if it would have happened, if somebody had stormed the cam Tolkien.  STU: 2008.  GLENN: People would have paid attention and went whoa. Because we had cities on fire and the government did nothing we weren't as shocked when people stormed the capitol. We all saw it and went this is horrible.  STU: That's an interesting point.  GLENN: It lowered and gave the equivocation of you didn't do anything here, you're doing something here, and these people have a reason to be pissed. It just gave all new wrinkled in the argument that hadn't been there 10, 15 years before.  STU: Yeah. The two things the democrats didn't understand when they saw this polling early on was there is real concern for quote unquote democracy in our country, there are much bigger concerns. People are much more concerned about the economy and inflation, and crime and the border, and many other things than democracy as a voting ish issue. Number two, they didn't realize that half the people saying they thought democracy under threat believed the democrats were the threat. They were the ones who were the problem here. It wasn't that everyone thought democracy was under threat because of January 6 or because of Donald Trump, many of them believe there were problems with the election. Many of them see what is going on when Republicans are being investigated by the IRS, for example. All of the corruption and massive problems that have gone on, even outside of the electoral process just the way the country's run. While it motivates and animates at some level, it's not the top of the mind issue. Also, there's half of the country who see the, let's say the left is doing with the January 6 commission and say you're the ones doing this. You're the ones violating the rules of our democracy. They've really invested a lot of resources in this and it's falling on its face.  GLENN: I find it amazing, mainstream media, major threat, almost 60 percent, minor threat, 23, not a threat 15. 15 percent, that's about I think the number of people that work for the federal government and the mainstream media. I mean, that is amazing.  STU: It's really bad.  GLENN: That's amazing. One more thing.  STU: Yeah.  GLENN: Also from the New York Times, they ranked major issues by importance. Let's see. Economy was 26, inflation 19.  STU: They split those two but that the same issue.  GLENN: Right.  STU: That's 45 percent saying it's the top issue. That's incredibly high.  GLENN: Here's what also is interesting to me, Trump Republicans and crime are in a three-way tie with climate change. I don't believe this poll. Crime is tied with Trump Republicans and climate change? Crime? You know; you're only going to get climate change and Trump Republicans, you get each side. Or you get double because climate change is really important and Trump Republicans are really important. But crime you get both parties saying crime.  STU: Yeah. I mean, again, I think the way the poll is phrased is top issue; is that right? Not just is it an issue. But is it your top issue? I think a lot of people who might say crime or the border are instead saying the economy or inflation.  GLENN: You're right. It was number three on my list.  STU: Yeah.  GLENN: You know what I mean?  STU: Right.  GLENN: You have economy, inflation, the state of democracy, immigration, then climate change with Trump Republicans and crime.  STU: And where was abortion again?  GLENN: Abortion was 5th, 4%.  STU: So think about what they've invested in here.  GLENN: I know.  STU: The democracy thing which is not paying off, the trump Republicans and abortion. They've funneled all of their resources and now there's pretty significant evidence that independent women are turned off by all of this abortion focus. Like wait a minute, I'm talking about independent pro-choice woman who are saying well, you know, pro-choice is an important issue for me, but guys like I gotta pay my bills. I gotta be able to afford bread. They're seeing this as you're focusing on that in this time? I think. Important too, and I want to fight for it, but wait a minute, I can't get my kids to school because gas is 5-dollars a gallon. GLENN: This is, I mean, this is the number one thing, I mean; the number one lesson from political campaigns in my lifetime has been the economy, the economy. People look at their pocketbook first, first, when things are going badly.  STU: James Carvil.  GLENN: Yeah, it's the economy, stupid. If things are going poorly for the average person the party in charge is not going to do well. How they have, I mean, maybe because they just knew the economy wasn't going to do well because we're just dismantling it. We're just dismantling it.  STU: I think people, a lot of times people look at the economy as people just care about money. The economy is your entire pragmatic life; right?  GLENN: It's your family. STU: It's everything. It's your entire existence. It's how, if you have enough money you can do the things that you want to do, you can spend your time pursuing the happiness yo want to pursue, there's a reason why people like getting rich. It's not just because they want shiny things. GLENN: It's not even rich.  STU: I know. But this is why people pursue it.  GLENN: I know. STU: Not because they want shiny things in their apartment or diamonds, that's all nice but you are able to do the things you want to do, to spend time with your kids instead of busting your butt at a second job. All These things are crucial to peoples lives. While, yes, I don't know what the max is, but maybe we can, maybe there's some liberals in our audience that can answer this, how many abortions can you have in a year? How many in a lifetime? Even if you really love abortion, how many times are you going through that? A couple? I don't know how many per week you can have but I know how many times I go to the grocery store. I know how many times I go to the gas pump. You're doing this all the time. These are things that affect your daily life. While you might think abortion is -- again, I do not support this view, you might think this is a good get out of jail free card  GLENN: This is a bad way to put it, but this is where I you're going through, but it's a luxury item. You know what I mean? It's not a necessity for most  STU: To end the life of a child?  GLENN: For most people they're not like -- it's like you said, get out of free, get out of jail free card. It's something that some people look at as a way out of a problem. So that a luxury item.  STU: Right. We know half the country doesn't agree with at all. Half of the country are males. So you're talking about let's say 25 percent of the country that would even consider at any point getting an abortion, and then you eliminate that to the people who actually do it. So what are you, at 5 percent of the nation? Like, I'm not saying it's not an important issue, but it goes back to quickly how Stacey Abrams talked about this the other day. In your minds you can abort your way out of inflation. You can abort your way into a good economy. That's a totally different view than the average person.  GLENN: You lost me at men can't have babies.  The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy people on the left. The AOC's have taken over, places in the media.And places like this in New York.This is what it is thousand. So there's been one case. One. One in the entire seven years. Where they did this.Where they shut down a company, that had no obvious victims.The case was 1972.And it was a company, relatively small company, that was writing term papers, for college students. Okay.So I want to write my paper.GLENN: I want to break out in God bless America.STU: Capitalism is pretty impressive. Apparently, this didn't go over that well.What they said, there were no obvious victims here. The people bought the term papers. They didn't want to write them. They got the term papers. They said, they were defrauding the education system.GLENN: Which they were.STU: This is the one time. And it's a small tiny company. Let me give you the other times they've done this.Tell me if any of these sound like, hey, I have a good interest rate, on a loan I paid back.Number one, a breast cancer nonprofit was shut down a do",-6,-5,
BECKNews_68," President Bidens nominee to be Americas national archivist, Colleen Shogan, has promised to be non-partisan if granted the role. But when she faced the Senate Homeland Security and Governmenting Affairs Committee earlier this week, Senator Josh Hawley proved the opposite may be true. In fact, Senator Hawley, used Shogan's tweets, PROVED before the committee that she was lying to them all  UNDER OATH! The take down was SO SATISFYING, Glenn says, but it will likely amount to NOTHING. In this clip, Glenn explains why&    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Oh, my goodness. Hello, and welcome to the Glenn Beck Program. We've got a lot to do today. I'm going to show you some things from this week, from a couple of hearings, that I just -- I mean, I cheer.We are actually starting to find a spine in this country.And that is so great! So great!However, we have to do more than cheer and yell at people. And when I say yell at people, I'm going to play some things, where it was insane. Well, let me start here. Let me just start with this.Because you'll understand how good it feels.Let's go to cut eight, with Senator Hawley, talking to the person that is going to be the -- our national archivist. Now, remember, the national archives, should just be somebody collecting all of the stuff, and preserving it.Okay?I don't want a political ideologue. I don't even -- I don't -- shh. I want somebody that nobody even cares to meet. Okay?This is like, you know, you'll have to meet the archivist, just to get that paper. Oh, they're so boring.But just tolerate it, because the stuff in the vault is really cool. Okay?That's who I want. But that's not who we're getting. Remember, the national archives are now saying, this document here is very triggering.Yes, if you're King George III, it shouldn't be triggering to you now. But I don't know, the national archives, it's kind of dicey. So who do we have? We have somebody who is a lefty.And on the second hearing, in the Senate, she was kind of caught in a little trap. Because on her first one, they had some tweets from her, that were like, you know who I just hate? All Republicans.I mean, just crazy stuff, that she just tweeted out.And so she made her Twitter feed, private, the day before she went to the hearing.And they only had a couple of her tweets. And they were going to use them, but they only had a couple of them, that they had printed off. Because she left it all open. Then the night before, she closes it down, so they don't have everything. So Hawley asks her. Can you tell me -- what's on your tweets. I mean, you closed them down.We have two of them here. What's on your tweets?She was under oath. Well, she was back. And I would just like to say, Senator Hawley, I -- I mean, whatever you need. Whatever you need. I mean, if you need my wife to make you some lasagna, bring it over, I'll personally put it on the fork and feed it to you. If that's what makes you happy.This exchange made me very happy.VOICE: Dr. Shogan, when you were here last year, a number of senators asked you, including me, a series of questions about an article you had written, public statements that you had made on social media, that were pretty grossly partisan, and I thought offensive. And you and I went back and forth about it. After that, a number of us asked you questions, relating to these statements. I want to follow up on one of them. I, in particular, asked you to give a full accounting of the public posts that you had made on Twitter. You had locked your Twitter account, before you came before this committee. It previously had been public.I asked you to provide the public posts, that previously had been made on Twitter. Because the ones we had were pretty disturbing. You responded, as follows. Quote, my personal Twitter account is comprised of posts about my history novels, events at the White House Historical Association, Pittsburgh sports teams, travels, and my dog.Let's talk a little bit about your Twitter posts then, that I was asking you about. On February 18th, 2022, you posted on Twitter, bemoaning the dropping of mask requirements for children, including those under the age of five. Do you remember that post?VOICE: No, Senator. Those tweets were in my personal capacity.VOICE: No, no, no. No. I asked you, would you give all public posts, that you had made on Twitter. You said no, effectively.And you said, that your Twitter posts consisted of mystery novels, events at the White House Historical Association, Pittsburgh sports teams, and my dog. You just told me now under oath, that you stood by that. Now, let's talk about your Twitter post.On February 18th, 2022, you posted bemoaning the fact that mask requirements for children, under the age of five, one of whom I happen to have by the way, has been dropped. Is that a post about your dog or sports teams?VOICE: My social media is my personal capacity, sir?VOICE: Answer my question, please. Because you've testified under oath, that you only posted about your dog, sports teams, and novels. And you also said you wouldn't give this committee, any of your public posts. So is your posts on February 18th, 2022, bemoaning the lifting of mask requirements, for children under the age of five. Who I might just ask, all the data has said, is extremely harmful to children, these mask requirements. We'll leave that aside for now.Is that a post about your dog or sports teams? Yes or no?VOICE: My social media is in my personal capacity, Senator.VOICE: Yes or no, Ms. Shogan. You are under oath before this committee, and I have to say, you have placed this issue squarely in record by repeatedly refusing to answer. Yes or no?GLENN: I love you.VOICE: My personal -- my social media is in my personal capacity, Senator.VOICE: So you're not answering my question. Let's talk about another post. Twenty-sixth of May, 2022, you talk about an assaults weapon ban. Retweet a post, ban assault weapons now. You say you agree this idea, you have to be a certain age to buy assault weapons in America. Is that a post about sports teams and your dog or mystery novels?VOICE: My social media is in my personal capacity, Senator.VOICE: I have to say, I have been here for four years. I have never seen a witness stonewall like this before. Never. I've seen a lot. This is extraordinary.I mean, this is unbelievable. And you want to be the archives of the United States. You lied to us, under oath.You lied to us in your QFRs. You just lied to me a second ago under oath. And now you're sitting here stonewalling, not answering questions about public posts that you made. Dr. Shogan, I will ask you again: Will you give to this committee your public posts on Twitter? Will you make them available?VOICE: My social media is in my personal capacity.VOICE: Mr. Chairman, I have to tell you, this is the most extraordinary thing I have seen in my brief time in the Senate. I have never seen a witness blatantly lie under oath, like Dr. Shogan has just done to this committee, stonewalled this committee, and just repeatedly just refused to answer my questions about her own posts that are in public. For these reasons, I will oppose your nomination. And I strongly, strongly urge this committee, to take action on this, and own up to the fact that she's misleading us, right before our eyes, Mr. Chairman.GLENN: I mean, don't you love him?Now, here's the thing that I want to point out.That was a shortened version. The long version is like eight minutes. And it is so satisfying. It is so satisfying.He's the first person that I have heard. I shouldn't say that. There's -- this has been a good week for this kind of stuff. That were actually holding people's feet to the fire!Now, it makes no difference, if it's all just words. And let me tell you why: There is a great McIntire piece on the Blaze today. Media acceptance of the lab leak theory is the turning of the COVID ratchet.This is the most important opinion piece, that I have read, on why the COVID leak is coming out.And what does it all mean?They -- he writes, if you thought this monumental collapse of credibility, this sudden implosion of certainty of the science, would give the media moments of hesitation, you were sadly mistaken. The progressive chattering class spent their days forcing the American public to pretend that men could become women, at cultural gunpoint. Science was never the lodestone of truth. They are not undergoing some sort of dramatic crisis here.While some would expect a little more coordination between the regime and its media arm to create a smoother narrative transition, this trailing dialectic serves its own purpose.Our ruling elite secure power through constant invocation of the state of exception.In theory, we live in a democracy, where the power of the government is constrained through the structure of the Constitution, and the will of the people.In practice, however, both limiting factors can be removed in the case of an emergency. A cunning leader knows that power once granted, is rarely returned. And it is very difficult for the public to hold anyone accountable, after the fact.When an emergency presents the opportunity to achieve power, under the state of exception, it is always best to manufacture the narrative, to secure that power as quickly as possible.And then make the adjustments later, after the power is firmly in hand. The pandemic, allowed for the creation of an indefinite state of exception. During which, the regime could lock down its political opponents, unleash its own supporters, to those who opposed them. Churches, gyms, were shuttered, abortion clinics, Walmarts were deemed essential. Leftist corporate allies like Amazon required near -- acquired near monopoly on -- on commerce. While their local retail competition was driven into bankruptcy.Trump supporters were forced to attend the funerals of their loved ones on Zoom. While Joe Biden voters, drank champagne in the streets, to celebrate his election. Politics, after all, is about rewarding your friends and punishing your enemies. He goes on to Trump and The View, et cetera, et cetera. But what we are now observing is the process by which our ruling elite consolidate the power they gained, by reconciling their narrative to something that more closely resembles reality. Bit by bit, the powers have had to admit the truth behind most of the conspiracy theories, that they so violently attacked. This slow drip of truth, is not some admission of failure or culpability. It is instead, designed to turn the political ratchet.Conservatives and COVID spectics -- skeptics get to feel vindicated. We have a moment of, a-ha! I told you so!Yet, nothing changes. The power isn't taken back. No one serves a punishment, for the crime.We must understand, that what holly just did there, is so satisfying. What Ted Cruz and Holly did this week, to Merrick Garland is just -- I mean, it was almost -- I mean, you could rate that as a porn.STU: We should go through that at some point again.GLENN: It was so -- it was so good.STU: Mahauck (phonetic) incident. Yeah.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we'll play this. We'll play a cut, if you haven't heard it yet. But it was so good. But it means nothing without teeth. They trust -- who was it?I want to say it was Biggs. Was it the Biggs amendment that was trying to go after Mayorkas. And all of the Republicans have all said, this is out of control. This is crazy.Well, there are two bills to impeach him. In a Republican House.And they are a long way from getting anybody to sign on. There's like 41 sponsors.That's it.Wait. Excuse me?Someone must pay the price, for what is happening in our society. Or nothing changes.You can feel vindicated, you can feel good. You can yell at people, but it doesn't change anything.That woman should not be in the -- as the archivist for multiple reasons.But she should pay some price, for lying under oath.They're all doing it.If they don't punish those people, why would you care?Why would you care? What meaning does your testimony even have?   The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires?

New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy peo",-1,-1,

BECKNews_70,"  	A pro-life pregnancy center in Buffalo, New York, that was ""fire-bombed"" last week became just the latest of many increasingly violent incidents and threats against the anti-abortion movement ahead of the Supreme Court's decision on Roe v. Wade. But, as CompassCare president Jim Harden said on ""The Glenn Beck Program,"" a strike like this may be proof the far-left is fully aware that the pro-life movement is working.  	""Glass was broken and fires lit because we do not comply with the ruling elites' position that we should be referring and providing for abortion,"" Harden told Glenn.  ""Women do not feel like they have a choice when they're facing an unplanned pregnancy. They feel stuck, trapped like they've got no choice, like they need to have an abortion. What we do is erase the need for abortion by transforming a woman's fear into confidence with ethical medical care and comprehensive community support throughout the pregnancy and beyond. So, [the activists] targeted women that night,"" he continued.   	Harden added that CompassCare, which continued to operate in an undisclosed location following the attack, provides all medical care and comprehensive community support ""for free,"" and compared his organization with certain so-called women's health centers that provide only ""what they get paid for, and that's abortion.""    	He went on to call out political leaders, namely, Gov. Kathy Hochul (D-N.Y.) for refusing to denounce violence against pro-life pregnancy centers.  	""They're refusing to say, 'Hey this is wrong. Violence is wrong everywhere, all the time.' This is not how you solve problems and their silence can only be interpreted as complicity,"" Harden asserted. ""It's emboldening these terrorists.""   	Photos posted online showed the damage at the CompassCare office, with broken windows, fire and smoke damage, and graffiti that reads, ""Jane was here,"" which Harden explained is a reference to the ""terrorist organization Jane??s Revenge."" 	Glenn credited Harden with coming up with ""the first measurable and repeatable medical model in the pregnancy center movement, which has helped hundreds of centers nationwide become more effective at reaching more women and saving more babies from abortion.""   	""There's a reason that ... the Buffalo office was the one that was hit [by activists],"" Glenn noted.   	""We have a national strategy and our strategy is working, and that's why we've been attacked,"" Harden said ""We know that the abortion battle lines are shifting, and the abortion industry is scrambling. And the reason why they attacked us is because, what we're doing to reduce abortion is working.""  	Watch the video below to catch more of the conversation:     	Can't watch? Listen to the episode highlights below:  To enjoy more of Glenn??s masterful storytelling, thought-provoking analysis, and uncanny ability to make sense of the chaos, subscribe to BlazeTV ?? the largest multi-platform network of voices who love America, defend the Constitution, and live the American dream. WRITER   The left-wing media's most recent tirade is accusing Trump of being a dictator. But, as Glenn said, ""erything they're accusing us of, they're doing."" Since day one, the Biden administration has overstepped the bounds placed on the executive branch set by the Constitution. In Glenn's most recent TV Special, he examined ten times Biden acted like a dictator, NOT a president. Here are 10 of Biden's Dictator Moves, and click HERE to get ALL of the research that went into this week's Glenn TV special:     WRITER   Every day it seems Glenn covers another story revealing how people across the world at all levels of power DESPISE the fact that YOU have rights, and they are actively trying to curtail them. Recently, there has been a string of attacks against the rights outlined in the First Amendment: the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, the freedom of assembly, and the freedom to petition. As a refresher, the First Amendment reads as follows: This is powerful stuff, there is a good reason the Founding Fathers made it the FIRST Amendment. It's also the reason why power-hungry elites are attacking it. These attacks are designed to control the way you think, speak, and believe, vote, what you read, and who holds your representatives responsible. The First Amendment is our strongest weapon against tyrants, and they know it. So what can you do about it? Hope that some wig in Washinton will eventually do something? We know how well that works. The best thing to do is to stay active, engage in the issues you care about, and exercise your rights.  So where to start? Here are a few things YOU can do to protect your First Amendment rights:                                Religion                                   The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is toyou guessed itpractice your faith. Become an active member in your place of worship, go to scripture studies, invite your friends to that late afternoon event, and walk the life. This can impact the way you spend money as well. Shop the businesses and brands that share your values, and don't shop at the ones that scorn them. Keeping the community alive and healthy is the best way to ensure that generations to come will be able to experience the freedom you enjoy.                              Speech                                   Much like religion, the best way to protect your freedom of speech is... to speak. Engage your friends and family in polite, civil conversation. Stand up for what you believe in, and make your case to your peers. Just remember to keep it friendly. No one ever won an argument by shouting down their opponent. The civil exchange of ideas is the cornerstone of our republic, and a dialogue where the participants are well-informed, considerate, compassionate, and open-minded can have permanent impacts on all involved.                              Press                                   Freedom of the Press seems a little tricky at first. Unless you work for the media, what are you supposed to do? Quit your job and go work for the local newspaper? The good news is that exercising this right is not nearly that difficult. In fact, you are currently doing it. The best thing you can do is to read from outlets that produce informative content. Want to know what Glenn consumes to stay informed every day?

Assembly                                    Anna Moneymaker / Staff | Getty ImagesFreedom of assembly is one of the more impactful yet underutilized freedoms in the First Amendment. Peaceably assembling and protesting with like-minded individuals can hugely influence politicians and policies while simultaneously creating community and fellowship between attendees. It's understandable why more people don't turn out. We're all busy people with busy schedules, and flying out to D.C. for the weekend seems like a daunting task to many. Thankfully, you don't have to go out all the way to D.C. to make a difference. Gather some like-minded people in your town and bring awareness to issues that impact your community. Big change starts locally, and exercising your freedom to assemble can be the catalyst to lasting impact.                               Petition                                   If you've been a long-time listener of Glenn, then you will have heard a few of his calls to action where he asks his audience to contact their representatives about a particular piece of policy. There is a good reason Glenn keeps on doing those: they work. Whether it's your local mayor or your senator, a call and an email go a long way. If you really want to make a change, convince your friends and family to reach out as well. The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is toyou guessed itpractice your faith.

WRITER   The crisis on the southern border has reached a boiling point following the controversial Supreme Court ruling that allowed the federal government to remove large portions of border security, triggering a movement of conservative governors defending Texas' right to protect its border.  We comm""nly hear about the border crisis through mainstream media as if it's an abstract issue that has little to no effect on our daily lives. However, for millions of Americans, the border crisis is in their backyard... literally... bringing crime up to their front doorstep??and it's coming to your doorstep soon.  These five stories paint a glimpse of the type of crime and cartel activity that is being enabled by the Biden administration's border policies.                                Assault and robbery in Massachusetts                                   On January 15th, Lucas Vilaca Moreira Fontenelle was arrested in Milford, Massac""setts for armed robbery of a bodega along with two other illegals a few days earlier. This comes just one month after ICE detained Fontenelle for assault, but the city of Milford cut him free as part of their status as a sanctuary city.                              Murder in New Your City                                   On January 6th, Moises Coronado chased down, beat, and fatally stabbed Dafren Canizalez while in a NYC shelter. Coronado illegally crossed the Texas border in November where he was detained before being released and making his way to New York.                               Cartel trafficking in El Paso                                   Late last month U.S. Border Patrol agents operating in the El Paso region arrested a cartel ""foot guide"" that was responsible for trafficking dozens of illegal immigrants across the border. The foot guide is a member of the La Linea Cartel, an operation based out of Juarez, Mexico whose gang warfare contributed to the city's 1,000+ homicides in 2023 alone.                               Human smuggling in Arizona                                   Last November, two teenagers were pulled over with five illegal immigrants in their car. The teens are being charged with human trafficking, and there is evidence that this was not their first trip. Authorities believe that these teens are the latest in a dangerous new trend of cartels using social media to pay teens to smuggle migrants across the border.                              Cartel trespassing in Arizona                                   Late last December, an Arizona rancher reported that he has seen a disturbing rise of cartel activity on his land. According to the rancher, he has seen evidence of cartels fighting for control of routes that pass through his property. He has even seen cartel scouts and human smugglers several times.

WRITER   On last week's Glenn TV special, Glenn dove into exactly how migrants from around the world are ending up on our southern border. The most shocking discovery, which was first published by investigators with Muckraker, was that multiple organizations have been providing maps showing immigrants exactly how to cross Central America and Mexico into the waiting hands of the cartel, who smuggle them across our border.  Just who is encouraging these people to make this perilous journey? You will likely recognize a few. Below are FIVE organizations that facilitate the crisis on our southern border.

BECKNews_71," The FBI recently charged multiple participants of a peaceful protest at an abortion facility in Tennessee. The pro-lifers originally were given a misdemeanor by local police&but that drastically escalated when the FBI got a hold of the story. Glenn explains how this story  plus other recent examples  show that the DOJ cannot be trusted. The DOJ has become an enforcement arm of the Democratic Party, Glenn says, and there WILL be more arrests. But we must continue to peacefully stand. Because not only are there more people on our side, Glenn says, but even the heavens are engaged' as well.     Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I just want to tell you, that the FBI has charged multiple people, peaceful protests, at abortion facilities.They -- this time, it's a bunch of -- basically, senior citizens.And they were -- they were all in this hallway to an abortion center. And they were just lining it. They were praying. They were singing.People were coming in. And, you know, the abortion clinic said, hey. We've got trellis passers here. And so they were given a misdemeanor by the police. Somehow or another, the FBI got a hold of this. And they realized, that's a major crime. Could put these people in jail for 11 years. Because they were forming a blockade. Oh, my gosh, I cannot take the hypocrisy here.So they also were being told, that they also were engaged in misinformation. The FBI isn't even performing the investigations. The DOJ is doing their own investigations, and using the FBI as their arm. Normally, the FBI does the investigation. And if they find someone guilty of federal crimes, they issue warrants. The DOJ is sending local branches of the FBI with the arrest warrants, to be their strong arm. So the DOJ now, is completely -- you cannot trust him. You cannot trust the DOJ. It has become an enforcement arm, of the Democratic Party or the Marxist party. Or whatever -- whoever is really running this place. It has become a wholly owned subsidiary, of that group.And you're going to start seeing people go to jail. Do not let this scare you.There are more on our side, than on the over. The heavens are engaged. Keep standing. And, we should stand for people who are being targeted by the FBI.We need to stand for them. Because this is happening over and over again. We had the abortion supporter, that confessed to travel from California to assassinate Brett Kavanaugh. Do we know anything about that?What happened to that guy? What happened to that?We have the pro-life teenager in Kansas, who reported being assaulted by an abortion supporter, while canvassing for a pro-life amendment in the state Constitution. On September, an 84-year-old Michigan woman, was shot in the back by an abortion supporter.In September, students for life, they reported that an abortion supporter through a cup of urine at two pro-life students while the group was peacefully displaying information about a pro-life campaign. You are going to be despised.You are going to be despised. This has not been all been told before. Mark Hawk, a pro-life Catholic activist and father of seven -- we told you earlier this week, that his home in Pennsylvania -- the FBI charged him with the same thing they're charging this. And I'm not making this up. I can't believe it.They're charging -- they're charging with the face act. A woman who is --STU: It's the act that stops you from -- from belonging the entrances to clinics, basically. That's what they keep going to. As if that was occurring. We have no evidence, that this has occurred. And there's apparently video, of some of these incidents, where that show the opposite.GLENN: Is this the one in the hallway? Yeah. Let's play this video real quick. If you happen to be watching Blaze TV.(music)GLENN: My gosh. It's almost --VOICE: Time out. Time out.GLENN: -- like Antifa. Look at them.VOICE: We can't do it here. We cannot block up the hallways.STU: They're not blocking the hallways, by the way.GLENN: They're not.VOICE: Outside. We have an understanding, guys. We need to carry it outside. We cannot block up the hallways.GLENN: You're not blocking the hallways. He's walking through it, telling them that. Easily walking through.Now, you can get them for trespassing, which is what the local police do, that was a misdemeanor. But they're going after -- the one that came in yesterday, guns a blazing, the FBI guns a blazing at this guy's house. He happened not to be there at the time. He is 73 years old.Or Eva Ettil, she's 87. Guns a blazing. Got to take her down. Eighty-seven. Yeah, no. She was planning on doing their damage.STU: Real danger to society. An 87-year-old trying to stop children from being aborted.GLENN: Oh, my gosh. Yeah. Now, listen, there's something else you need to be aware of, and look, you need to -- you need to begin to stand.I urge you to get the Ten Commandments from Martin Luther King. You -- you have no place in the healing of America, if you want to engage, with fists or anything else.You have no place, in the healing. You will destroy us. And you're no fan of mine. And I'm no fan of yours.But you have to begin to stand. We have to stand for these people. Why isn't there a group of prayer activists, in front of the DOJ, every single day? Or your local FBI office. That's probably more important. Because I think these FBI agents locally, they know this isn't right. They know this isn't right. The guys in Washington, they're so far lost, I think, that I don't know.The DOJ, lost. But not our local guys. I hope to -- and I pray. Why aren't there prayer activists in front, right now? Because they are persecuting people for their religious view, on life. These are religious political prisoners in America.I want to give you something else that you need to be aware of, that happened, that we found out about, last night, in 60 seconds.No -- there's nothing quite like a flash sale, to remind you what a great company MyPillow is.

Ten-second station ID.(music)GLENN: There's newly implemented measures now, that mandate that the FBI pass on the personal information of rejected gun buyers, to local law enforcement.As part of a sweeping change, federally licensed firearm dealers, FFLs. Are now required to provide the FBI, with the personal addresses, of any individuals, who attempt to purchase, was denied. Well, doesn't the federal government already have that?Because it is the federal government that denies it! We send in the paperwork, while we're standing there. And you deny it, or you approve it, so you got the paperwork. Not good enough. Now they need the address of anybody who has failed.And not only those who are denied, but anybody who has delayed approval. And the personal information of the rejected and individuals, they say, it's going to law enforcement. Local law enforcement.What does that mean? What is the law enforcement going to do? The changes were quietly implemented last week by the FBI's national instant criminal background check system. To comply with the new federal law. Did you even know this was happening?Also, this should terrify anybody, and not -- this should terrify everybody who just wants to -- oh. I don't know. Have even a surgeon. You know, reach inside of you, and do something.Maitland Jones Jr. He has been fired for Princeton University, after his course was found to be -- you'll never fill in this blank. You'll never -- try. Try. His course was found to be. You'll never do it.STU: Racist.GLENN: No. That's too easy. STU: Hateful.GLENN: No. STU: Non-gender affirming.GLENN: No. His organic chemistry course. It's so easy.STU: Part of the patriarchy?GLENN: His course at Princeton was deemed too hard. Too hard.(laughter)STU: At Princeton?GLENN: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. This is the guy who wrote the textbook on organic chemistry. Okay? He's in his fifth edition. The textbook. It's too hard now.He went out of his way. He taped all of his lectures, at his own cost. So everybody could keep up. You can't make it. You want to go back and reflect. You want to really -- nope! Nope!It was too hard and, quote, that will keep too many students out of medical school.(laughter)You can't pass this course, maybe you shouldn't be the doctor. You're not the doctor I'm looking for. I think. Holy cow.   The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy people on the left. The AOC's have taken over, places in the media.And places like this in New York.This is what it is thousand. So there's been one case. One. One in the entire seven years. Where they did this.Where they shut down a company, that had no obvious victims.The case was 1972.And it was a company, relatively small company, that was writing term papers, for college students. Okay.So I want to write my paper.GLENN: I want to break out in God bless America.STU: Capitalism is pretty impressive. Apparently, this didn't go over that well.What they said, there were no obvious victims here. The people bought the term papers. They didn't want to write them. They got the term papers. They said, they were defrauding the education system.GLENN: Which they were.STU: This is the one time. And it's a small tiny company. Let me give you the other times they've done this.Tell me if any of these sound like, hey, I have a good interest rate, on a loan I paid back.Number one, a breast cancer nonprofit was shut down a dozen years ago. For using nearly all its $9 million in donations to pay for director's salaries, perks, and other expenses, instead of funding free mammograms. Okay.So they told everyone, donate money for free. Mammograms. And they just took all the money for themselves.That's number one. Number two, a private equity timber.Faking big investment success, was closed down after stealing millions of dollars from thousands of investors.Okay?You can see.GLENN: Yeah. Got it. But on both of those so far, you have hundreds of thousands of people, you know, I'm sure. That gave -- they're all victims.They gave their money.STU: Yeah. And they didn't get the thing that they want.GLENN: They didn't get the thing they were promised. You have all these people going to the AG. Saying, hey, this is a real problem here. This has to stop. Not here.GLENN: Not here.STU: Another one. Mental health facility, shuttered for looting $4 million from public funds, while neglecting patients.GLENN: Okay. Kind of a big one.STU: Pretty clear. An auto lender that allegedly charged hidden interest rates, got to stay in business last year if it paid a fine and didn't commit fraud in the future.So here's one they didn't shut down.They actually let them go on.They're going after Trump in all of this. In this one, they're like, oh. Sure, they're hidden fees.They're not telling you about them.GLENN: Okay.STU: A judge requested.A judge refused to request to shut down a river rafting company in 2011.After a customer drowned, and the attorney general showed it was repeatedly using unlicensed guides, or none at all.Instead, he ordered only a 50,000-dollar bond and cleanup -- for him to clean up his act.The company is still being run today, under a different name by the same family. Someone died.GLENN: We have thousands of victims.And in this case, somebody who is dead.STU: Is dead!GLENN: Dead!STU: They're like, you guys can stay open -- and then this one is my favorite one. A judge in 2001.Declined to appoint a receiver, to take over a porn site, despite m",,-3,-2
BECKNews_72," Glenn once warned that one day you??d wake up and not recognize your country any more. Are you there yet? Governments at every level have been weaponized against Americans. The FBI shows up in full tactical gear at the homes of pro-lifers, terrifying young children and grandmas for the ""rime"" of peacefully protesting abortion. The ATF surprises legal gun owners on their doorsteps, demanding to see their firearms. State governments are trying to sneak in laws that allow the sexual mutilation of children  without the parents consent. When we become confused as to what the government can and cannot do, we become numb to tyranny and take it on the chin, as we did with the COVID-19 mandates. And when the state comes knocking, we dont know how to deal with it because we havent lived in that kind of country since 1791. Glenn warns we're on the same road as every empire that ended in collapse. Glenn features the stories of everyday Americans who have experienced government tyranny firsthand: But tyrants can only exist when the people they are trying to subjugate forget that there are fundamental rights granted not by the state, but by a higher power. And we have the blueprint to stop tyranny dead in its tracks. The founders armed us with the tools  we just need to know how to wield them. So how do peaceful Americans stand up to tyranny that comes in the disguise of law? Glenn and a panel of legal experts including Sen.

Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy people on the left. The AOC's have taken over, places in the media.And places like this in New York.This is what it is thousand. So there's been one case. One. One in the entire seven years. Where they did this.Where they shut down a company, that had no obvious victims.The case was 1972.And it was a company, relatively small company, that was writing term papers, for college students. Okay.So I want to write my paper.GLENN: I want to break out in God bless America.STU: Capitalism is pretty impressive. Apparently, this didn't go over that well.What they said, there were no obvious victims here. The people bought the term papers. They didn't want to write them. They got the term papers. They said, they were defrauding the education system.GLENN: Which they were.STU: This is the one time. And it's a small tiny company. Let me give you the other times they've done this.Tell me if any of these sound like, hey, I have a good interest rate, on a loan I paid back.Number one, a breast cancer nonprofit was shut down a dozen years ago. For using nearly all its $9 million in donations to pay for director's salaries, perks, and other expenses, instead of funding free mammograms. Okay.So they told everyone, donate money for free. Mammograms. And they just took all the money for themselves.That's number one. Number two, a private equity timber.Faking big investment success, was closed down after stealing millions of dollars from thousands of investors.Okay?You can see.GLENN: Yeah. Got it. But on both of those so far, you have hundreds of thousands of people, you know, I'm sure. That gave -- they're all victims.They gave their money.STU: Yeah. And they didn't get the thing that they want.GLENN: They didn't get the thing they were promised. You have all these people going to the AG. Saying, hey, this is a real problem here. This has to stop. Not here.GLENN: Not here.STU: Another one. Mental health facility, shuttered for looting $4 million from public funds, while neglecting patients.GLENN: Okay. Kind of a big one.STU: Pretty clear. An auto lender that allegedly charged hidden interest rates, got to stay in business last year if it paid a fine and didn't commit fraud in the future.So here's one they didn't shut down.They actually let them go on.They're going after Trump in all of this. In this one, they're like, oh. Sure, they're hidden fees.They're not telling you about them.GLENN: Okay.STU: A judge requested.A judge refused to request to shut down a river rafting company in 2011.After a customer drowned, and the attorney general showed it was repeatedly using unlicensed guides, or none at all.Instead, he ordered only a 50,000-dollar bond and cleanup -- for him to clean up his act.The company is still being run today, under a different name by the same family. Someone died.GLENN: We have thousands of victims.And in this case, somebody who is dead.STU: Is dead!GLENN: Dead!STU: They're like, you guys can stay open -- and then this one is my favorite one. A judge in 2001.Declined to appoint a receiver, to take over a porn site, despite millions of dollars of illegal credit card charges to hundreds of customers.Who thought they were getting a free tour.Now, look, you're -- you want to get the free -- you want to know what you're subscribing for, Glenn. Before you just pulled the trigger on that. So you put your credit card information into a porn site, I think some of these victims need some life changes to be made here.But they put their credit card into a porn site. Expecting a free tour.They instead, get charged and charged and charged and charged.In fact, once the owners of the site were caught, they attempted to move their money overseas, to avoid any penalty.Still, the judge said, appointing a receiver was an extraordinary remedy!That should be used sparingly, and that a preliminary injunction was good enough.Only after all that happened, it they find out, the people running the porn site, were the Gambino crime family.(laughter)I kid you not. The Gambino crime family.GLENN: And they didn't go into receivership.STU: So there you go. Think about that.I mean, it's so obvious, what they're doing. Latitia james talked about it when she ran.Her goal was to take this one individual out.And the New York -- the voters of New York, said, good.Go do it.And now she's doing it.GLENN: Okay. If you are -- if you have business in in New York, if you're in New York, I'm just telling you. You have to do what you have to do.There's no way, I would keep my business in New York.There is no rule of law now. You know it on the streets. But there is no rule of law. If they can get away with this. They can do anything to you.   Elon Musk has announced that the first Neuralink patient can now control a computer mouse by just thinking. But while this technology could help a lot of people, should we proceed with caution? Between AI and this new merger of man and machine, Glenn gives a warning about what the future could hold. Glenn and Stu also review the controversy surrounding Googles Gemini AI, which refused to generate images of white people.     Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: So the website, Down Detector, detected a surge in outage reports from users at AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Customer Cellular, Boost Mobile, US Cellular, and Straight Talk.That the reports of the system being downed or outages, began at 3:45 a.m. Eastern time. The outages have been reported across many major US cities.It looks like, that it is back up. I'm not sure.They say, they don't think this was a cyber attack.But how did all of them go down at the same time?I mean, that's kind of weird.Yesterday, Israel had a cyber attack.It was from Iran. The Israelis say. And it was an attack on their cell phone services.So quite a coincidence. But let's not jump to any conclusions. Let's see what actually happened.Cyber attacks are going to happen. At some point, soon. We will have cyber attacks. And it will leave you vulnerable, if that's what you depend on.We are becoming more and more, a society that is connected in all things, and absolutely incapable of doing any things, without our electronics.We hit a milestone yesterday. This is truly like landing a man on the moon, I think. This is -- this is the first real merging of man and machine, I think. I mean, we've had the electronic. You know, the bionic arms and things like that.But this is in your mind.It's Neuralink. Elon Musk came up with it. And it is really tempting, because this is -- you know, this will be great to some degree. You'll be able to access information, and have the old internet in your head. You want to speak French?Okay. Download it. Got it.I mean, it is really -- isn't that the Matrix?STU: Yeah. The Matrix too. We're turning into The Matrix. That's the theme of the show today. GLENN: So that is now the beginnings of that, happened and was announced yesterday. Elon Musk said, Neuralink is active in the first person, to have one of the chips implanted in their brain. They have seemingly made a full recovery.We -- you know, so far. We don't know what the effects of this are, or will be. But Musk said, the patient can now move the mouse around a screen, just by thinking.So he has Bluetoothed himself to the screen.Crazy. Huh.STU: It's incredible that they can do that. And, you know, also, look at the way Elon Musk does business.This is a lot of what he does. Which is a lot of kind of just -- let's try it. There's a lot of -- hey, let's give it a whirl.GLENN: He said I think yesterday or earlier this week, that he had plans by 2029, to have a million people on Mars.And when I heard that, I thought, there's no -- oh, it's Elon Musk. Maybe.STU: Well, yeah. And this is his goal, with all of this stuff. He has -- I think it's a T-shirt or something. He wears. Like occupy mars.This is the central idea of his life.GLENN: And this is part of it. Neuralink is part of it.He believes that we are on such a dystopian track right now. That because of global warming, but also because of AI.He believes AI is just as dangerous as global warming. He believes we cannot compete with AI.Unless we can merge with it. Okay.Because it will be operating at such high speeds. We don't have the processing capabilities for the speeds.You know, it's kind of like -- kind of like dogs. Dog life. Seven years. One year for us.It's like one year is a thousand years for AI.So it's moving at such a rapid speed, we won't be able to keep up. So he believes that we need to be able to merge with the machine, until we can get off, this planet.I don't think he'll be taking Neuralink with him. Or maybe he just thinks we won't have access to this AI on Mars.But that's really what is -- is driving him. Driving his whole life.STU: It's really, really hard.Because I know, it feels creepy. And there are risks. And all of that.But it's like, it's really, really hard to think about telling someone, who is paralyzed that, no. We could make you move. But we don't want to pursue that technology.Like, I don't know. I mean, it's just -- it's such incredible technology.And for all of the other stuff, that he's done. Which is really impressive. I mean, Elon Musk is an impressive dude.Space travel. You know, the electric car stuff. I don't care about the electric car stuff that much. But it's still really impressive what he's been able to do.Everyone basically said, you couldn't do it. And no other company could be able to do that. He did that. He's done so many incredible things. But if he was able to take people, you know, with disabilities. And all these -- these issues that have been unsolvable throughout all of human history, and somehow figure out a way to -- through Neuralink or something similar, to solve that for people, it would be the greatest thing he has ever accomplished by a long shot.GLENN: So my daughter Mary had brain surgery, about three, four years ago.STU: Yeah. I remember.GLENN: And it was perfect for a long time.All of her seizures went away. Earlier this year, I think it was in the summer, she started to have breakthrough seizures.And they are even on medication now, they are grand mal. They are --STU: Hmm.GLENN: They're just terrifying. And -- and I said to her, this was about four years ago.I said, honey, if you wait. Elon Musk is doing experience with Neuralink.And one of the things that Neuralink will do. Is it will -- you know, patch all of the brain damage.It will take where -- when you have a stroke, it's like a highway.And there's you all these highways running to different parts of your brain. And if you have a strok",,-8,-9
BECKNews_73," Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams has a new pro-abortion conspiracy theory: ""There is no such thing as a [fetal] heartbeat at six weeks ... it is a manufactured sound designed to convince people that men have a right to take control of a woman??s body.""On the radio program Thursday, Glenn Beck and producer Stu Burguiere agreed Abrams' latest ""misinformation"" is not just ridiculous but could be dangerous if people are actually willing to believe her. ""If you want to defend abortion, go ahead and defend it. Defend what you're actually doing. Stop denying what is reality,"" Stu said. ""If this is such a great defensible policy, then just come out and defend it, but they never can ... you notice how they can't go to the actual thing they say is so important. They keep defending these other things that aren't true."" Glenn said the pro-choice movement was successful for a long time because most people want the decision to be up to the woman and her doctor and that abortion should be safe, legal, and rare. But when leftists began ""celebrating"" their abortions or calling for ""abortion on demand"" at any point in the pregnancy, that's when they start to lose support.  ""Because they've celebrated abortion and are losing regular people, you can't put that genie back in the bottle. So, what do they have to do now? They have to take the insane step of discrediting medical machines and technology,"" Glenn said. ""This is after two years, by the way, of them claiming the biggest scandal in the world was people suggesting the voting machines were hacked ?? after they previously said that voting machines were hacked in elections they [Democrats] lost,""Stu pointed out. ""Honestly, gang, think this through because this is where life gets very scary. This is where you go to authoritarian rule and you can kill millions of people because you're truly now discrediting things that everyone knows is true,"" Glenn warned.  ""So, if you disagree ... you can say that is an evil magic box that has made up sounds in it to convince people. If they will buy that, you're at the Salem witch trials. 'If she doesn't float, she wasn't a witch.' That's what you're looking at right now ?? and what's frightening is, [Abrams] can say this with a straight face and no one discredits her,""he continued.  ""You don't think that they can convince those people that you are a terrorist because of the way you vote? [...] You don't think they can convince half the country that you should be eliminated, liquidated, put into a camp, whatever authoritarians love to do? ... We are headed towards dangerous, dangerous times. We better wake up and stand together because this is frightening ?? it's hilarious ?? but because people are taking it seriously, it is terrifying,""lenn added.

WRITER  Texas is under threat of a George Soros-backed takeover. Soros-funded RINO judges have been elected in some of the highest courts in Texas. These judges implemented restrictions that have blocked nearly a thousand cases of voter fraud from being investigated or prosecuted from across the ""te. These new restrictions are similar to ones in place in states like George, Arizona, and Wisconsin, leaving Texas more susceptible to election corruption than ever. If Texas falls to corruption, America will lose its largest bastion of conservative electoral power in the nation. Without Texas, Republicans WILL NOT be able to win national elections and liberal corruption will go unchecked across the country.  Fortunately, there is a way to stop this: YOU. If you live in Texas you have a chance to stand up against corruption and to fight back! Starting Tuesday, February 20th, early voting for the primaries begins, where three of these judges are up for election. Go out and vote. If the right people are voted in, there's a good chance the restrictions will be lifted and election fraud can once again be prosecuted.  But remember, you can't just go in and vote for anyone who has an ""R"" next to their name. Sorors knows that a registered Democrat would never stand a chance in Texas, so his lackeys register as Republicans and ride the little ""R"" right into office. So who do you vote for?  Fortunately, Glenn had Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on his show today and Ken gave us his list of judges that he vouches for. His list is as follows:    WRITER  Who is really banning books? For years now, Conservatives have been taking flak from the left for supposed ""book bans."" The left likes to compare these ""bans"" to Nazi book burnings, accusing the right of sweeping authoritarian decrees designed to suppress information. In reality, this is a movement largely motivated by parents, who want to remove inappropriate books from children's libraries.  But if you want to discuss authoritarian book bans, look no further than the White House. As Glenn recently covered, the Biden administration has been pressuring the world's largest bookseller, Amazon, into suppressing books they disagree with. On February 5th, 2024, Ohio Representative Jim Jordan released a slew of subpoenaed documents that exposed pressure placed on Amazon by the Biden Administration. The documents, which Jordan dubbed ""The Amazon Files"" after Elon Musk's ""The Twitter Files,"" revealed an email conversation between Andrew Slavitt, a former White House senior adviser, and Amazon employees. In these emails, Slavitt complained that the top search results for books on ""vaccines"" were ""concerning"" and then requested that Amazon intervene. Amazon initially refused, not out of some altruistic concern for the free exchange of information. They thought any action taken would be ""too visible"" and would further exasperate the ??Harry/Sally narrative,?? referring to the outrage that followed Amazon's removal of Ryan T. Anderson??s book When Harry Became Sally.  Despite this initial refusal, Amazon agreed to meet with the White House a few days later. The number one item on their agenda was""oving books from the website. An Amazon employee even admitted that the reason they even took this meeting was due to the pressure being placed on them by the Biden Administration.  What was the result of this meeting? Amazon caved. They began to implement ways of limiting the outreach of books that challenged the mainstream vaccine narrative and other books the White House might not like. The White House was caught red-handed pressuring the world's largest bookseller to restrict the sale of books they consider in opposition to their narrative, and they have the gall to accuse conservatives of information suppression. This is just ONE of many actions committed by the Biden Administration that are more characteristic of a dictator than a president. What can you do about it? Fortunately, you are not dependent on Amazon and its corrupted algorithm to help you find books.

WRITER   The left-wing media's most recent tirade is accusing Trump of being a dictator. But, as Glenn said, ""Everything they're accusing us of, they're doing."" Since day one, the Biden administration has overstepped the bounds placed on the executive branch set by the Constitution. In Glenn's most recent TV Special, he examined ten times Biden acted like a dictator, NOT a president. Here are 10 of Biden's Dictator Moves, and click HERE to get ALL of the research that went into this week's Glenn TV special:     WRITER   Every day it seems Glenn covers another story revealing how people across the world at all levels of power DESPISE the fact that YOU have rights, and they are actively trying to curtail them. Recently, there has been a string of attacks against the rights outlined in the First Amendment: the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, the freedom of assembly, and the freedom to petition. As a refresher, the First Amendment reads as follows: This is powerful stuff, there is a good reason the Founding Fathers made it the FIRST Amendment. It's also the reason why power-hungry elites are attacking it. These attacks are designed to control the way you think, speak, and believe, vote, what you read, and who holds your representatives responsible. The First Amendment is our strongest weapon against tyrants, and they know it. So what can you do about it? Hope that some wig in Washinton will eventually do something? We know how well that works. The best thing to do is to stay active, engage in the issues you care about, and exercise your rights.  So where to start? Here are a few things YOU can do to protect your First Amendment rights:                                Religion                                   The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is toyou guessed itpractice your faith. Become an active member in your place of worship, go to scripture studies, invite your friends to that late afternoon event, and walk the life. This can impact the way you spend money as well. Shop the businesses and brands that share your values, and don't shop at the ones that scorn them. Keeping the community alive and healthy is the best way to ensure that generations to come will be able to experience the freedom you enjoy.                              Speech                                   Much like religion, the best way to protect your freedom of speech is... to speak. Engage your friends and family in polite, civil conversation. Stand up for what you believe in, and make your case to your peers. Just remember to keep it friendly. No one ever won an argument by shouting down their opponent. The civil exchange of ideas is the cornerstone of our republic, and a dialogue where the participants are well-informed, considerate, compassionate, and open-minded can have permanent impacts on all involved.                              Press                                   Freedom of the Press seems a little tricky at first. Unless you work for the media, what are you supposed to do? Quit your job and go work for the local newspaper? The good news is that exercising this right is not nearly that difficult. In fact, you are currently doing it. The best thing you can do is to read from outlets that produce informative content. Want to know what Glenn consumes to stay informed every day?

Assembly                                    Anna Moneymaker / Staff | Getty ImagesFreedom of assembly is one of the more impactful yet underutilized freedoms in the First Amendment. Peaceably assembling and protesting with like-minded individuals can hugely influence politicians and policies while simultaneously creating community and fellowship between attendees. It's understandable why more people don't turn out. We're all busy people with busy schedules, and flying out to D.C. for the weekend seems like a daunting task to many. Thankfully, you don't have to go out all the way to D.C. to make a difference. Gather some like-minded people in your town and bring awareness to issues that impact your community. Big change starts locally, and exercising your freedom to assemble can be the catalyst to lasting impact.                               Petition                                   If you've been a long-time listener of Glenn, then you will have heard a few of his calls to action where he asks his audience to contact their representatives about a particular piece of policy. There is a good reason Glenn keeps on doing those: they work. Whether it's your local mayor or your senator, a call and an email go a long way. If you really want to make a change, convince your friends and family to reach out as well. The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is to??you guessed it??practice your faith.

BECKNews_74," Glenn Beck has warned that one day, you'll wake up and not recognize your country anymore. Are you there yet?  Governments at every level have been weaponized against Americans. The FBI shows up in full tactical gear at the homes of pro-lifers, terrifying young children and grandmas for the ""crime"" of peacefully protesting abortion. The ATF surprises legal gun owners on their doorsteps, demanding to see their firearms. State governments are trying to sneak in laws that allow the sexual mutilation of children  without the parents consent.  When we become confused as to what the government can and cannot do, we become numb to tyranny and take it on the chin, as we did with the COVID-19 mandates. And when the state comes knocking, we dont know how to deal with it because we havent lived in that kind of country since 1791. Glenn warns were on the same road as every empire that ended in collapse.  But tyrants can only exist when the people they are trying to subjugate forget that there are fundamental rights granted not by the state but by a higher power. And we have the blueprint to stop tyranny dead in its tracks. The founders armed us with the tools  we just need to know how to wield them. So how do peaceful Americans stand up to tyranny that comes in the disguise of law? Glenn and a panel of legal experts, including Sen. Mike Lee, arm you with the answers so you'll know what to do when the government comes knocking on YOUR door next.  This is perhaps the most important special we've ever aired on BlazeTV.

Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy people on the left. The AOC's have taken over, places in the media.And places like this in New York.This is what it is thousand. So there's been one case. One. One in the entire seven years. Where they did this.Where they shut down a company, that had no obvious victims.The case was 1972.And it was a company, relatively small company, that was writing term papers, for college students. Okay.So I want to write my paper.GLENN: I want to break out in God bless America.STU: Capitalism is pretty impressive. Apparently, this didn't go over that well.What they said, there were no obvious victims here. The people bought the term papers. They didn't want to write them. They got the term papers. They said, they were defrauding the education system.GLENN: Which they were.STU: This is the one time. And it's a small tiny company. Let me give you the other times they've done this.Tell me if any of these sound like, hey, I have a good interest rate, on a loan I paid back.Number one, a breast cancer nonprofit was shut down a dozen years ago. For using nearly all its $9 million in donations to pay for director's salaries, perks, and other expenses, instead of funding free mammograms. Okay.So they told everyone, donate money for free. Mammograms. And they just took all the money for themselves.That's number one. Number two, a private equity timber.Faking big investment success, was closed down after stealing millions of dollars from thousands of investors.Okay?You can see.GLENN: Yeah. Got it. But on both of those so far, you have hundreds of thousands of people, you know, I'm sure. That gave -- they're all victims.They gave their money.STU: Yeah. And they didn't get the thing that they want.GLENN: They didn't get the thing they were promised. You have all these people going to the AG. Saying, hey, this is a real problem here. This has to stop. Not here.GLENN: Not here.STU: Another one. Mental health facility, shuttered for looting $4 million from public funds, while neglecting patients.GLENN: Okay. Kind of a big one.STU: Pretty clear. An auto lender that allegedly charged hidden interest rates, got to stay in business last year if it paid a fine and didn't commit fraud in the future.So here's one they didn't shut down.They actually let them go on.They're going after Trump in all of this. In this one, they're like, oh. Sure, they're hidden fees.They're not telling you about them.GLENN: Okay.STU: A judge requested.A judge refused to request to shut down a river rafting company in 2011.After a customer drowned, and the attorney general showed it was repeatedly using unlicensed guides, or none at all.Instead, he ordered only a 50,000-dollar bond and cleanup -- for him to clean up his act.The company is still being run today, under a different name by the same family. Someone died.GLENN: We have thousands of victims.And in this case, somebody who is dead.STU: Is dead!GLENN: Dead!STU: They're like, you guys can stay open -- and then this one is my favorite one. A judge in 2001.Declined to appoint a receiver, to take over a porn site, despite millions of dollars of illegal credit card charges to hundreds of customers.Who thought they were getting a free tour.Now, look, you're -- you want to get the free -- you want to know what you're subscribing for, Glenn. Before you just pulled the trigger on that. So you put your credit card information into a porn site, I think some of these victims need some life changes to be made here.But they put their credit card into a porn site. Expecting a free tour.They instead, get charged and charged and charged and charged.In fact, once the owners of the site were caught, they attempted to move their money overseas, to avoid any penalty.Still, the judge said, appointing a receiver was an extraordinary remedy!That should be used sparingly, and that a preliminary injunction was good enough.Only after all that happened, it they find out, the people running the porn site, were the Gambino crime family.(laughter)I kid you not. The Gambino crime family.GLENN: And they didn't go into receivership.STU: So there you go. Think about that.I mean, it's so obvious, what they're doing. Latitia james talked about it when she ran.Her goal was to take this one individual out.And the New York -- the voters of New York, said, good.Go do it.And now she's doing it.GLENN: Okay. If you are -- if you have business in in New York, if you're in New York, I'm just telling you. You have to do what you have to do.There's no way, I would keep my business in New York.There is no rule of law now. You know it on the streets. But there is no rule of law. If they can get away with this. They can do anything to you.   Elon Musk has announced that the first Neuralink patient can now control a computer mouse by just thinking. But while this technology could help a lot of people, should we proceed with caution? Between AI and this new merger of man and machine, Glenn gives a warning about what the future could hold. Glenn and Stu also review the controversy surrounding Googles Gemini AI, which refused to generate images of white people.     Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: So the website, Down Detector, detected a surge in outage reports from users at AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Customer Cellular, Boost Mobile, US Cellular, and Straight Talk.That the reports of the system being downed or outages, began at 3:45 a.m. Eastern time. The outages have been reported across many major US cities.It looks like, that it is back up. I'm not sure.They say, they don't think this was a cyber attack.But how did all of them go down at the same time?I mean, that's kind of weird.Yesterday, Israel had a cyber attack.It was from Iran. The Israelis say. And it was an attack on their cell phone services.So quite a coincidence. But let's not jump to any conclusions. Let's see what actually happened.Cyber attacks are going to happen. At some point, soon. We will have cyber attacks. And it will leave you vulnerable, if that's what you depend on.We are becoming more and more, a society that is connected in all things, and absolutely incapable of doing any things, without our electronics.We hit a milestone yesterday. This is truly like landing a man on the moon, I think. This is -- this is the first real merging of man and machine, I think. I mean, we've had the electronic. You know, the bionic arms and things like that.But this is in your mind.It's Neuralink. Elon Musk came up with it. And it is really tempting, because this is -- you know, this will be great to some degree. You'll be able to access information, and have the old internet in your head. You want to speak French?Okay. Download it. Got it.I mean, it is really -- isn't that the Matrix?STU: Yeah. The Matrix too. We're turning into The Matrix. That's the theme of the show today. GLENN: So that is now the beginnings of that, happened and was announced yesterday. Elon Musk said, Neuralink is active in the first person, to have one of the chips implanted in their brain. They have seemingly made a full recovery.We -- you know, so far. We don't know what the effects of this are, or will be. But Musk said, the patient can now move the mouse around a screen, just by thinking.So he has Bluetoothed himself to the screen.Crazy. Huh.STU: It's incredible that they can do that. And, you know, also, look at the way Elon Musk does business.This is a lot of what he does. Which is a lot of kind of just -- let's try it. There's a lot of -- hey, let's give it a whirl.GLENN: He said I think yesterday or earlier this week, that he had plans by 2029, to have a million people on Mars.And when I heard that, I thought, there's no -- oh, it's Elon Musk. Maybe.STU: Well, yeah. And this is his goal, with all of this stuff. He has -- I think it's a T-shirt or something. He wears. Like occupy mars.This is the central idea of his life.GLENN: And this is part of it. Neuralink is part of it.He believes that we are on such a dystopian track right now. That because of global warming, but also because of AI.He believes AI is just as dangerous as global warming. He believes we cannot compete with AI.Unless we can merge with it. Okay.Because it will be operating at such high speeds. We don't have the processing capabilities for the speeds.You know, it's kind of like -- kind of like dogs. Dog life. Seven years. One year for us.It's like one year is a thousand years for AI.So it's moving at such a rapid speed, we won't be able to keep up. So he believes that we need to be able to merge with the machine, until we can get off, this planet.I don't think he'll be taking Neuralink with him. Or maybe he just thinks we won't have access to this AI on Mars.But that's really what is -- is driving him. Driving his whole life.STU: It's really, really hard.Because I know, it feels creepy. And there are risks. And all of that.But it's like, it's really, really hard to think about telling someone, who is paralyzed that, no. We could make you move. But we don't want to pursue that technology.Like, I don't know. I mean, it's just -- it's such incredible technology.And for all of the other stuff, that he's done. Which is really impressive. I mean, Elon Musk is an impressive dude.Space travel. You know, the electric car stuff. I don't care about the electric car stuff that much. But it's still really impressive what he's been able to do.Everyone basically said, you couldn't do it. And no other company could be able to do that. He did that. He's done so many incredible things. But if he was able to take people, you know, with disabilities. And all these -- these issues that have been unsolvable throughout all of human history, and somehow figure out a way to -- through Neuralink or something similar, to solve that for people, it would be the greatest thing he has ever accomplished by a long shot.GLENN: So my daughter Mary had brain surgery, about three, four years ago.STU: Yeah. I remember.GLENN: And it was perfect for a long time.All of her seizures went away. Earlier this year, I think it was in the summer, she started to have breakthrough seizures.And they are even on medication now, they are grand mal. They are --STU: Hmm.GLENN: They're just terrifying. And -- and I said to her, this was about four years ago.I said, honey, if you wait. Elon Musk is doing experience with Neuralink.And one of the things that Neuralink will do. Is it will -- you know, patch all of the brain damage.It will take where -- when you have a stroke, it's like a highway.And there's you all these highways running to different parts of your brain. And if you have a stroke, that highway is",,-6,-6

WRITER  Texas is under threat of a George Soros-backed takeover. Soros-funded RINO judges have been elected in some of the highest courts in Texas. These judges implemented restrictions that have blocked nearly a thousand cases of voter fraud from being investigated or prosecuted from across the state. These new restrictions are similar to ones in place in states like George, Arizona, and Wisconsin, leaving Texas more susceptible to election corruption than ever. If Texas falls to corruption, America will lose its largest bastion of conservative electoral power in the nation. Without Texas, Republicans WILL NOT be able to win national elections""d liberal corruption will go unchecked across the country.  Fortunately, there is a way to stop this: YOU. If you live in Texas you have a chance to stand up against corruption and to fight back! Starting Tuesday, February 20th, early voting for the primaries begins, where three of these judges are up for election. Go out and vote. If the right people are voted in, there's a good chance the restrictions will be lifted and election fraud can once again be prosecuted.  But remember, you can't just go in and vote for anyone who has an ""R"" next to their name. Sorors knows that a registered Democrat would never stand a chance in Texas, so his lackeys register as Republicans and ride the little ""R"" right into office. So who do you vote for?  Fortunately, Glenn had Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on his show today and Ken gave us his list of judges that he vouches for. His list is as follows:    WRITER  Who is really banning books? For years now, Conservatives have been taking flak from the left for supposed ""book bans."" The left likes to compare these ""bans"" to Nazi book burnings, accusing the right of sweeping authoritarian decrees designed to suppress information. In reality, this is a movement largely motivated by parents, who want to remove inappropriate books from children's libraries.  But if you want to discuss authoritarian book bans, look no further than the White House. As Glenn recently covered, the Biden administration has been pressuring the world's largest bookseller, Amazon, into suppressing books they disagree with. On February 5th, 2024, Ohio Representative Jim Jordan released a slew of subpoenaed documents that exposed pressure placed on Amazon by the Biden Administration. The documents, which Jordan dubbed ""The Amazon Files"" after Elon Musk's ""The Twitter Files,"" revealed an email conversation between Andrew Slavitt, a former White House senior adviser, and Amazon employees. In these emails, Slavitt complained that the top search results for books on ""vaccines"" were ""concerning"" and then requested that Amazon intervene. Amazon initially refused, not out of some altruistic concern for the free exchange of information. They thought any action taken would be ""too visible"" and would further exasperate the ??Harry/Sally narrative,?? referring to the outrage that followed Amazon's removal of Ryan T. Anderson??s book When Harry Became Sally.  Despite this initial refusal, Amazon agreed to meet with the White House a few days later. The number one item on their agenda was""oving books from the website. An Amazon employee even admitted that the reason they even took this meeting was due to the pressure being placed on them by the Biden Administration.  What was the result of this meeting? Amazon caved. They began to implement ways of limiting the outreach of books that challenged the mainstream vaccine narrative and other books the White House might not like. The White House was caught red-handed pressuring the world's largest bookseller to restrict the sale of books they consider in opposition to their narrative, and they have the gall to accuse conservatives of information suppression. This is just ONE of many actions committed by the Biden Administration that are more characteristic of a dictator than a president. What can you do about it? Fortunately, you are not dependent on Amazon and its corrupted algorithm to help you find books. Every week right here on GlennBeck.com, we highlight books that Glenn is reading or talking about in our ""Glenn's Bookshelf"" series. Here you can find a wide selection of books free from Amazon's filters. Be sure to sign up for Glenn's newsletter to find out about new additions to ""Glenn's Bookshelf"" every week.    WRITER   The left-wing media's most recent tirade is accusing Trump of being a dictator. But, as Glenn said, ""Everything they're accusing us of, they're doing."" Since day one, the Biden administration has overstepped the bounds placed on the executive branch set by the Constitution. In Glenn's most recent TV Special, he examined ten times Biden acted like a dictator, NOT a president. Here are 10 of Biden's Dictator Moves, and click HERE to get ALL of the research that went into this week's Glenn TV special:     WRITER   Every day it seems Glenn covers another story revealing how people across the world at all levels of power DESPISE the fact that YOU have rights, and they are actively trying to curtail them. Recently, there has been a string of attacks against the rights outlined in the First Amendment: the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, the freedom of assembly, and the freedom to petition. As a refresher, the First Amendment reads as follows: This is powerful stuff, there is a good reason the Founding Fathers made it the FIRST Amendment. It's also the reason why power-hungry elites are attacking it. These attacks are designed to control the way you think, speak, and believe, vote, what you read, and who holds your representatives responsible. The First Amendment is our strongest weapon against tyrants, and they know it. So what can you do about it? Hope that some wig in Washinton will eventually do something? We know how well that works. The best thing to do is to stay active, engage in the issues you care about, and exercise your rights.  So where to start? Here are a few things YOU can do to protect your First Amendment rights:                                Religion                                   The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is toyou guessed itpractice your faith. Become an active member in your place of worship, go to scripture studies, invite your friends to that late afternoon event, and walk the life. This can impact the way you spend money as well. Shop the businesses and brands that share your values, and don't shop at the ones that scorn them. Keeping the community alive and healthy is the best way to ensure that generations to come will be able to experience the freedom you enjoy.                              Speech                                   Much like religion, the best way to protect your freedom of speech is... to speak. Engage your friends and family in polite, civil conversation. Stand up for what you believe in, and make your case to your peers. Just remember to keep it friendly. No one ever won an argument by shouting down their opponent. The civil exchange of ideas is the cornerstone of our republic, and a dialogue where the participants are well-informed, considerate, compassionate, and open-minded can have permanent impacts on all involved.                              Press                                   Freedom of the Press seems a little tricky at first. Unless you work for the media, what are you supposed to do? Quit your job and go work for the local newspaper? The good news is that exercising this right is not nearly that difficult. In fact, you are currently doing it.

Assembly                                    Anna Moneymaker / Staff | Getty ImagesFreedom of assembly is one of the more impactful yet underutilized freedoms in the First Amendment. Peaceably assembling and protesting with like-minded individuals can hugely influence politicians and policies while simultaneously creating community and fellowship between attendees. It's understandable why more people don't turn out. We're all busy people with busy schedules, and flying out to D.C. for the weekend seems like a daunting task to many. Thankfully, you don't have to go out all the way to D.C. to make a difference. Gather some like-minded people in your town and bring awareness to issues that impact your community. Big change starts locally, and exercising your freedom to assemble can be the catalyst to lasting impact.                               Petition                                   If you've been a long-time listener of Glenn, then you will have heard a few of his calls to action where he asks his audience to contact their representatives about a particular piece of policy. There is a good reason Glenn keeps on doing those: they work. Whether it's your local mayor or your senator, a call and an email go a long way. If you really want to make a change, convince your friends and family to reach out as well. The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is to??you guessed it??practice your faith. Become an active member in your place of worship, go to scripture studies, invite your friends to that late afternoon event, and walk the life. This can impact the way you spend money as well. Shop the businesses and brands that share your values, and don't shop at the ones that scorn them. Keeping the community alive and healthy is the best way to ensure that generations to come will be able to experience the freedom you enjoy. Much like religion, the best way to protect your freedom of speech is... to speak. Engage your friends and family in polite, civil conversation. Stand up for what you believe in, and make your case to your peers. Just remember to keep it friendly. No one ever won an argument by shouting down their opponent. The civil exchange of ideas is the cornerstone of our republic, and ",,-3,-2
BECKNews_77," Weeks before facing Georgias far-left senator in a debate, Republican candidate Herschel Walker called himself a not that smart country boy during an interview with the Savannah Morning News. Walker predicted his opponent, Senator Raphael Warnock, would show up and embarrass him. But, actually, the OPPOSITE came true. Walker DESTROYED Warnock during the two Senate candidates debate, and in this clip, Glenn plays the video to prove it&      Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: So Herschel walker, he's no man's dummy, he came out a couple of weeks ago and said I'm going to get killed in the debate. I'm going to get killed. This guy is a preacher, he's used to talking all the time. I don't do this.  STU: I'm just a country boy.  GLENN: I'm a country boy. And the country boy taught the city boy a few things, I think. It went shockingly really well for, and I say shockingly because he said I'm going to suck.  STU: Right.  GLENN: He did not suck. I don't think it was a clear knockout.  STU: He did well.  GLENN: He did really well.  STU: There is a way, you have a candidate who's a celebrity who's never done this before, in his firstever debate like this. There's a story that goes unfortunately that ends in his campaign being destroyed where he gets on stage, he doesn't know what he's talking about, he screws up, whatever. That did not happen at all.   OBSERVER: The fact they don't have a potato thing like Dan Quail on this guy's first and only debate is quite a victory.  STU: He did well, he was prepared for the lines of attack that he expected to come from Warnock, which were very predictable. Warnock I think came off as incredibly slimy. That would be the word I would use to describe his performance. he's somewhat polished, right? He is. As Herschel walker pointed out the guy's a preacher he's been speaking publicly his entire life so he way not, it was not like he was   GLENN: It's not hard.  STU: He was stumbling over his own words or he 59 where he lookd flustered all the time, but he went to arguments that were obviously not real. He avoided, he was asked about does he have any restrictions on abortion, and as usual, you even though he was asked be clear, be specific, you know, do you have any restriction on abortion all the way up to the last month did not answer the question, avoided it, and he just filibustered these time. I think the average person en Georgia could look at this and be like this guy just doesn't answer these questions.  GLENN: Let's go through some of the cut. Here is Warnock, cut 13, talking about Black Lives Matter. >> He told me Black Lives Matter. If you think about it, senator, in Atlanta, Georgia, there is more Black babies is aborted than anything. If Black Lives Matter why are you not protecting those babies and instead of aborting those babies why are you not baptizing those babies?  GLENN: What a great line. Probably the best one. Here is on life. >> I said that's a lie lie. I put it in a book. One thing about my life is I've been very transparent, not like the senator. He's hid things. At the same time I said that a lie and on abortion, you know I'm a Christian, I believe in life. I tell people this: Georgia is a state that respects life and I'll be a senator that protects lie. Id that was a lie and I'm not backing down and we have senator Warnock, people that would do anything, say anything for this seat, but I'm not going to back down because this seat is too important to the Georgia people for me to back down right now.  GLENN: Here he is on also not backing down on support of Donald Trump. >> Walker, former President Trump is also considering a run for the white house in 2023. If you could 55 a simple yes or no answer, would you support a Trump 2024 run? >> Yes, I would. President Trump is my friend, it has nothing to do with  I won't leave my allies, which is what Senator Warnock and Joe Biden did.; they left their allies. They left their allies right now on a foreign stage. A lot of these people don't trust us no more. They don't trust us to be strong anymore so they're waiting to see who's going to stand up, who's going to trust, and they have no one to trust right now because as Is President Trump is my friend. He won't stand up with Biden, when yet he's voted with him 96 percent of the time? Let's be real.  STU: It's interesting because he says he doesn't want to stand up with Biden, that comes from a am. In the debate where he would not say just right before this question was asked he would not say whether he would support Joe Biden running in 204. He wouldn't say that he, should he run in 2024. He was like I'm not thinking, I haven't put one moment of thought into 2024. It's 2022 is a few weeks away. It hassen crossed my mind one time. Does anybody believe the senator from Georgia has not thought about the 2024 election? Everyone watching that knew he was lying. And look, you may or may not like Donald Trump, but what you do know when you watch Herschel Walker answer that question is he's not lying. He's just telling you you might not like Trump, he might not be your friend, he might not be your kind of guy, I support him, I'm sticking with him. That's was a I they don't think really powerful part and in talking about how both Warnock and Biden were arguing that everything went well in Afghanistan as we aBannonned all our allies there was a real powerful way of tieing that all together. Again, that not something that a guy who's never inn been in a debate before can usually pull off. GLENN: He did really bewell because it seemed totally natural. Let me go to Cut 4, Herschel Walker. >> I believe in reducing insulin but at the same time you gotta eat right. Unless you have eating right, insulin is doing you no good. So you have to get food prices down and you got a get gas down so they can go get insulin. Yo continue to pat yourself on the back but right now families are starving. Right now families are hurting and they're hurting because of the bills and the laws you're passing right now. GLENN: Do you know that six out of ten Americans are living paycheck to paycheck? They just are barely making it. They've had to cut back on everything. Six out of ten. And the economy is booming?  STU: I bow. This goes to, this is a New York Times article today with an amazing headline, it's democrats spent 2 trilliondollars to save the economy. They don't want to talk about it. Think about this, this is the central accomplishment of the Biden administration and of Warnock's first two years, this $2 trillion in spending and none of them will even mention that it occurred. Warnock avoided it for the entire hour, never talked about this 2 trilliondollars they spent. Shouldn't it be all they're talking about? It's the biggest spending plan any of us have ever seen and he doesn't want to acknowledge it. Really remarkable. GLENN: Here is Herschel Walker on Warnock's church that seems to be throwing people out. >> Because he won't answer that he evicted the people from church. I told him I will pay, I'll pay the salary. You evicting them right now  >> We have time. >> We have not evicted. We have not evicted those  >> I didn't write the article. [LAUGHTER] >> Your  >> Most of the people out there  (Crosstalk). >> Discussion if you start talk overing over here other  >> Can I speak, senator. >> He should take that money and pay it back to the Veterans that he exploited while he  >> You can tell that he's not desperate because if he had read that thing he would have saw that I had nothing to do with that. He is so desperate right now he really want that seat, he's now telling you I didn't event anyone, it is written in the paper. I didn't do this. Well, senator, you did. And it's okay to speak the truth.  GLENN: Wow. Wow. And final, um, Herschel Walker and the police. >> One thing I have not done, I've never pretended to be a police officer and I've never, I've never threatened a shootout with the police. And now I have to respond to that. >> We are moving on, gentlemen. >> I have to respond to that. I am police officers and at the same team. >> Mr. Walker. >> Wait, wait. >> Excuse me, Mr. Walker, please, out of respect, I need you to let you know, Mr. Walker, you are very wellaware of the rules tonight. >> Yes. >> And you have a prop. >> Yes. >> That is not allowed sir. I have ask you to put that prop away. >> This is not a prop. This is real. He says I have a problem with law enforcement. >> Mr. Walker  GLENN: I can't take this. It's definitely not a prop. I have a pen and a piece of paper. If the guy says and you can't even write and then I write down with this pen and paper yes, I can, and hold it up, is the paper a prop? He's sitting there and his badge is in his pocket.  STU: You can see him reach for it.  GLENN: It's not a prop. It's my wallet. Is my wallet a prop? He's saying that I don't have these privileges. Now, I don't know the story behind it but they're now writing its as if it was a prop badge, that he got it from Hollywood. It's not. It is an actual badge. Now, I don't know what that grants him, but that's not a prop. I think he did extraordinarily well.  STU: Yeah. I think needed to prove to the people of Georgia that he was able to do this; right? He was able to run in these circles and talk about Theis these issues and know what he's talking about and where think hefulled that off. That a big step for a candidate who's running his first campaign like this. We have not seen that out of John Fetterman; right?  GLENN: No. STU: Katie Hobbs in Arizona won't even go out on a debate stage with Carrie Lake. Herschel wacker showed himself to be someone to be reckoned with, and that a beg step in a race like this.  GLENN: If you're afraid of your candidate, the run one you're running against, if you're afraid of them, how are you going to stand up to Putin? How are you going to stand up to Biden? How are you going to stand up to Trump? How are you going to stand up? You're showing me you're afraid of a debate, of being exposed. Being exposed for what? For what? Pretending to be a cop? Having an abortion? He wasn't afraid of that. What are you afraid of, your record? Is that what it is? The people that you align yourself with, is that what you're afraid of? Well, then that should tell you something. Maybe you're on the wrong side. If you don't think you're on the wrong side, why don't you have the courage to stand up and defend the things you're for? It's cowardice, cowardice all around. Stand up for what you really believe  The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy people on the left. The AOC's have taken over, places in the media.And places like this in New York.This is what it is thousand. So there's been one case. One. One in the entire seven years. Where they did this.Where they shut down a company, that had no obvious victims.The case was 1972.And it was a company, relatively small company, that was writing term papers, for college students. Okay.So I want to write my paper.GLENN: I want to break out in God bless America.STU: Capitalism is pretty impressive. Apparently, this didn't go over that well.What they said, there were no obvious victims here. The people bought the term papers. They didn't want to write them. They got the term papers. They said, they were defrauding the education system.GLENN: Which they were.STU: This is the one time. And it's a small tiny company. Let me give you the other times they've done this.Tell me if any of these sound like, hey, I have a good interest rate, on a loan I paid back.Number one, a breast cancer nonprofit was shut down a do",,-3,-2
BECKNews_78," Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot lamented the loss of ""respect for the institutions of our democracy"" and ""toxicity in our public discourse"" in the wake of Monday's mass shooting during a Fourth of July parade in Highland Park, Illinois. This is the same Lori Lightfoot who just last week publicly shouted ""F*** Clarence Thomas,"" demonstrating a stunning lack of respect for a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.  ""What it feels like is happening in this moment in our democracy is people are losing respect for the institutions of our democracy,"" Lightfoot said during a news conference on Tuesday. ""The toxicity in our public discourse is a thing I think we should all be concerned about,"" she added.  ""We have got to focus on what brings us together and not what tears us apart, and we've got to get back to respect for each other and respect for community. And that's the thing, I think, that concerns me the most over the arc of the last two years,"" Lightfoot, who in May urged for a ""call to arms,"" had the audacity to suggest.  Last week, however, the definitely-not-toxic Democrat publicly shouted ""F*** Clarence Thomas,"" ripped into anyone who objected to her wanton lack of respect, and later doubled down with a tweet proudly captioned ""I said what I said.""   A tweet provided by Townhall.com put Lightfoot's hypocrisy on full display: Filling in for Glenn Beck on the radio program Wednesday, Pat Gray and Stu Burguiere called out Mayor Lightfoot's glaring hypocrisy and the left's misleading narrative on gun violence in America.

WRITER  Texas is under threat of a George Soros-backed takeover. Soros-funded RINO judges have been elected in some of the highest courts in Texas. These judges implemented restrictions that have blocked nearly a thousand cases of voter fraud from being investigated or prosecuted from across the state. These new restrictions are similar to ones in place in states like George, Arizona, and Wisconsin, leaving Texas more susceptible to election corruption than ever. If Texas falls to corruption, America will lose its largest bastion o""onservative electoral power in the nation. Without Texas, Republicans WILL NOT be able to win national elections and liberal corruption will go unchecked across the country.  Fortunately, there is a way to stop this: YOU. If you live in Texas you have a chance to stand up against corruption and to fight back! Starting Tuesday, February 20th, early voting for the primaries begins, where three of these judges are up for election. Go out and vote. If the right people are voted in, there's a good chance the restrictions will be lifted and election fraud can once again be prosecuted.  But remember, you can't just go in and vote for anyone who has an ""R"" next to their name. Sorors knows that a registered Democrat would never stand a chance in Texas, so his lackeys register as Republicans and ride the little ""R"" right into office. So who do you vote for?  Fortunately, Glenn had Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on his show today and Ken gave us his list of judges that he vouches for. His list is as follows:    WRITER  Who is really banning books? For years now, Conservatives have been taking flak from the left for supposed ""book bans."" The left likes to compare these ""bans"" to Nazi book burnings, accusing the right of sweeping authoritarian decrees designed to suppress information. In reality, this is a movement largely motivated by parents, who want to remove inappropriate books from children's libraries.  But if you want to discuss authoritarian book bans, look no further than the White House. As Glenn recently covered, the Biden administration has been pressuring the world's largest bookseller, Amazon, into suppressing books they disagree with. On February 5th, 2024, Ohio Representative Jim Jordan released a slew of subpoenaed documents that exposed pressure placed on Amazon by the Biden Administration. The documents, which Jordan dubbed ""The Amazon Files"" after Elon Musk's ""The Twitter Files,"" revealed an email conversation between Andrew Slavitt, a former White House senior adviser, and Amazon employees. In these emails, Slavitt complained that the top search results for books on ""vaccines"" were ""concerning"" and then requested that Amazon intervene. Amazon initially refused, not out of some altruistic concern for the free exchange of information. They thought any action taken would be ""too visible"" and would further exasperate the ??Harry/Sally narrative,?? referring to the outrage that followed Amazon's removal of Ryan T. Anderson??s book When Harry Became Sally.  Despite this initial refusal, Amazon agreed to meet with the White House a few days later. The number one item on their agenda was""oving books from the website. An Amazon employee even admitted that the reason they even took this meeting was due to the pressure being placed on them by the Biden Administration.  What was the result of this meeting? Amazon caved. They began to implement ways of limiting the outreach of books that challenged the mainstream vaccine narrative and other books the White House might not like. The White House was caught red-handed pressuring the world's largest bookseller to restrict the sale of books they consider in opposition to their narrative, and they have the gall to accuse conservatives of information suppression. This is just ONE of many actions committed by the Biden Administration that are more characteristic of a dictator than a president. What can you do about it? Fortunately, you are not dependent on Amazon and its corrupted algorithm to help you find books. Every week right here on GlennBeck.com, we highlight books that Glenn is reading or talking about in our ""Glenn's Bookshelf"" series.

WRITER   The left-wing media's most recent tirade is accusing Trump of being a dictator. But, as Glenn said, ""Everything they're accusing us of, they're doing."" Since day one, the Biden administration has overstepped the bounds placed on the executive branch set by the Constitution. In Glenn's most recent TV Special, he examined ten times Biden acted like a dictator, NOT a president. Here are 10 of Biden's Dictator Moves, and click HERE to get ALL of the research that went into this week's Glenn TV special:     WRITER   Every day it seems Glenn covers another story revealing how people across the world at all levels of power DESPISE the fact that YOU have rights, and they are actively trying to curtail them. Recently, there has been a string of attacks against the rights outlined in the First Amendment: the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, the freedom of assembly, and the freedom to petition. As a refresher, the First Amendment reads as follows: This is powerful stuff, there is a good reason the Founding Fathers made it the FIRST Amendment. It's also the reason why power-hungry elites are attacking it. These attacks are designed to control the way you think, speak, and believe, vote, what you read, and who holds your representatives responsible. The First Amendment is our strongest weapon against tyrants, and they know it. So what can you do about it? Hope that some wig in Washinton will eventually do something? We know how well that works. The best thing to do is to stay active, engage in the issues you care about, and exercise your rights.  So where to start? Here are a few things YOU can do to protect your First Amendment rights:                                Religion                                   The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is toyou guessed itpractice your faith. Become an active member in your place of worship, go to scripture studies, invite your friends to that late afternoon event, and walk the life. This can impact the way you spend money as well. Shop the businesses and brands that share your values, and don't shop at the ones that scorn them. Keeping the community alive and healthy is the best way to ensure that generations to come will be able to experience the freedom you enjoy.                              Speech                                   Much like religion, the best way to protect your freedom of speech is... to speak. Engage your friends and family in polite, civil conversation. Stand up for what you believe in, and make your case to your peers. Just remember to keep it friendly. No one ever won an argument by shouting down their opponent. The civil exchange of ideas is the cornerstone of our republic, and a dialogue where the participants are well-informed, considerate, compassionate, and open-minded can have permanent impacts on all involved.                              Press                                   Freedom of the Press seems a little tricky at first. Unless you work for the media, what are you supposed to do? Quit your job and go work for the local newspaper? The good news is that exercising this right is not nearly that difficult. In fact, you are currently doing it. The best thing you can do is to read from outlets that produce informative content. Want to know what Glenn consumes to stay informed every day?

Assembly                                    Anna Moneymaker / Staff | Getty ImagesFreedom of assembly is one of the more impactful yet underutilized freedoms in the First Amendment. Peaceably assembling and protesting with like-minded individuals can hugely influence politicians and policies while simultaneously creating community and fellowship between attendees. It's understandable why more people don't turn out. We're all busy people with busy schedules, and flying out to D.C. for the weekend seems like a daunting task to many. Thankfully, you don't have to go out all the way to D.C. to make a difference. Gather some like-minded people in your town and bring awareness to issues that impact your community. Big change starts locally, and exercising your freedom to assemble can be the catalyst to lasting impact.                               Petition                                   If you've been a long-time listener of Glenn, then you will have heard a few of his calls to action where he asks his audience to contact their representatives about a particular piece of policy. There is a good reason Glenn keeps on doing those: they work. Whether it's your local mayor or your senator, a call and an email go a long way. If you really want to make a change, convince your friends and family to reach out as well. The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is to??you guessed it??practice your faith. Become an active member in your place of worship, go to scripture studies, invite your friends to that late afternoon event, and walk the life. This can impact the way you spend money as well.

BECKNews_79," Failed candidate for governor of Georgia, Stacey Abrams, has a new pro-abortion conspiracy theory: There's no such thing as a fetal heartbeat at 6 weeks! It's ""manufactured"" by men to control women's bodies. Glenn and Stu discuss just how ridiculous this ""misinformation"" is and the dangerous implications it could have if people are willing to believe it: ""If they will buy that, you're at the Salem Witch Trials""    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: So Stacey Abrams says, there's no such thing as a fetal heartbeat at six weeks. That's weird. Because I know there's a fetal heartbeat on the -- on the sixth week. The seventh week. The eighth, ninth, 11th, 12th. All the way, still heartbeat.Even now. I still have a heartbeat. It's weird. It's not fetal. But I still have a heartbeat. So no such thing as a fetal heartbeat in six weeks. Not true, says she.Now, she says that this is a manufactured sound. If you haven't heard, a fetal heartbeat, here's a fetal heartbeat from...Okay. What is that sound? What is that sound? Fetal heartbeat. No. No. That's the sound you hear at a cheap motel. Something is going on in the room up above. Listen to it again. Tell me I'm wrong. Tell me I'm wrong.That's what it is. That's what it is. And we put them into this magic box, okay? Just, we go and we tape from seedy motels. We tape the goings-on in other rooms. We put it in this magic box. And then just because we're trying to get rid of the hand sanitizer that New York had. It's all expired now, that they bought with taxpayer money. We take that hand sanitizer. That's what it is. They say it's a gel. But you just wipe it on a woman's belly. And you take that magic stick. On that magic stick. When you position it right, you hit a switch. And it makes the magic box, play what you recorded at the hotel.STU: That's science for you. That's Stacey Abrams' branded science.GLENN: I'm quoting. Do we have her actually saying this in audio? Here she is.VOICE: There is no such thing as a heartbeat -- it is a manufactured sim designed to convince people, that men have a right to take control of a woman's body.GLENN: Wow. Wow.You know, I thought it was a big deal, that she thought she was the governor, you know. When she wasn't the governor.And then she had this amazing turnaround, where she said she never said that. I thought that was kind of amazing -- this is -- for people who follow the science.Now, I don't know if you follow the science. But for people who follow the science, I'm pretty sure that's not a manufactured sound. I'm pretty sure what that is, is a heartbeat.Now, I'm only saying that because that's what science tells us.STU: Hmm.GLENN: And the evil magic box. I don't know if I trust it anymore.STU: Well, the evil magic box was designed by men. You know, men who wanted to take -- I mean, what was the quote? That men have the -- it was a sound designed to convince people.GLENN: That men have the right to take control of a woman's body. Amen.STU: What a weird -- see, what a strange view of the world. GLENN: Can I just tell you, as a man, as a man, and, you know, let's say a dirtbag man. The worst side of me, as a man. If I'm getting women and children pregnant, and I have no desire to settle down. Yeah, can I drive you there? How can I pay for that abortion? Okay?Guys would be all in for that. That is much better than having a child, with a woman you were just sleeping with and you don't really want to have a relationship. And then that kid comes knocking at your door going, daddy. Men would rather you have an abortion.That's what makes sense to me. Well, how -- I'm trying to understand. I'm trying to understand.STU: You think men, if they designed the machine, would make it sound like nothing. Because they want to get out of whatever weird night they had last nature.GLENN: I could be a cancerous growth. I could be a cancerous growth. I may be a tumor. I may be a tumor. That's what it would say.STU: This is, of course, why so many on the left opposed the policy of having ultrasounds before abortion. Because they know they will hear the heartbeat. They will see if there's -- there's a scan to see. They can see the movement. They can see the baby formed.When people are --GLENN: Yeah. And it's 80 percent. The mother is 80 percent more likely to have the baby, than kill the baby. If she hears the heartbeat.They know this. So that's why she's not discrediting men. She's not just saying -- I mean, she's absolutely wrong about men. We -- we did that, so you would have children?I don't think so. So she's wrong about that. But what is she doing? She's discrediting the machine.I mean, in such a --STU: Yeah.GLENN: A neophyte way.It's almost like, well, I was at this airport. And I just had to tell them, look at how heavy that thing is!That's not going to be able to fly. They're putting you into a hypnosis trap. They're saying they're flying you someplace. You're not actually going anywhere. They're putting a mind trick in, so you think you went into your Cleveland office.STU: This really is, we never went to the moon level conspiracy. You can see -- you can see it on the video. You can see the heartbeat.You can hear it. This is what is going on. It is --GLENN: It's a manufactured sound.STU: If you want to defend abortion. Go ahead and defend it. Defend what you're actually doing. Stop denying what is reality. That's all you have to do. If this is such a great defensible policy, then just come out and defend it.But they never can. You notice after the Dobbs thing, they're not talking about abortion. They're talking about, well, what if you have an ectopic pregnancy. Well, what if a woman has a miscarriage. You can't get it removed. First of all, none of this has anything to do with the laws that you pass on abortion. But secondarily, you notice how they can't go to the thing they say is important. They keep defending these other things that aren't true, and are much totally different process, as we've been talking about. But like, if they really believe, this was so defensible. They might occasionally defend it.GLENN: That's why they were successful for a long time. Because they said, look, you don't want somebody else making decisions for the woman and for the people involved.That's -- let the doctor and the woman figure this out. And we pray, or we hope, that it is rare. But it has to be safe and legal. That's how they talk you into the boat.Because that's how most people feel. Most people are not for abortion, at the very end. They're not -- but if -- if -- most people feel, okay. I don't know exactly when life begins. I mean, I think I do, because the egg is alive and the sperm is alive. So it is life when they join. But you can do argue about this back and forth.Most people feel like, hey. Once it's, you know, kind of identifiably as a baby, then we shouldn't kill it. And they would say, I -- I hope that it doesn't happen. But in cases of incest or rape, or something like that, then, you know, go ahead.But it should be rare. But it should also be safe, and legal.That was winning.Celebrate your abortions. I've had 1800 abortions. And I loved every one. I think it was my -- well, it was my 300th. That's when I will always remember, that it was so great, that I celebrated at the time. I mean, that's where they lose everybody.And because they've celebrated their abortion. And are losing regular people. You can't put that genie back in the bottle. What do they have to do?They now have to take the insane step, of discrediting medical machines and technology.STU: This is after two years, by the way, claiming that the biggest scandal in the world, were people saying the voting machines were hacked, after they had previously said that voting machines were hacked in previous elections they lost.Do a search, real quick. On Twitter. Social media.Is Stacey Abrams -- does she have a warning that this is mis or disinformation? Because this is important medical information. Right?This is important medical information. She's saying that ultrasounds are not real. That the sound of the baby --STU: That's true.GLENN: Is not real.STU: That's really what she's doing. And this is a relatively recent thing from the left. Where they started calling it a flicker instead of a heartbeat. Remember that whole thing? The New York Times called it a flicker instead of -- wait a minute. A flicker. It's been a heartbeat. We know it's a heartbeat. It's one of the most amazing moments of early pregnancy. You're there. Maybe your spouse is with you. You hear a heartbeat for the first time.It's an overwhelming emotional experience. Or it's created by men to control women. Or it's just a mechanical sound of some sort.GLENN: Now, honestly, gang, think this through. Because this is where life gets very scary. This is where you go to authoritarian rule. And you can kill millions of people. Because you're truly, now. Discrediting things that everyone knows is true. Okay?So if you disagree with it. You can do say, that's an evil magic box, that has made-up sounds in it, to convince people.If they will buy that, you're at the Salem witch trials. You're at the Salem witch trials.Well, if she doesn't float, she wasn't a witch. That's what you're looking at, right now. And what's frightening is, she can say this with a straight face, and no one discredits her from her own side. No one is saying today, you know, I was for Stacey Abrams, and then I heard that. And that's just evil magic box stuff. That's witchcraft. What are you talking about? What are you talking about? I can't support her.This is -- this is a woman who is delusional, and has dangerous thinking. You know, we can't put her into a role of any kind of authority. If she thinks this. And she really believes this. And if not, she's just -- she doesn't care about lying. Nobody is saying this. Nobody is saying that on the left. Not a soul.You don't think that they can convince those people, that you are a terrorist? Because of the way you vote?Of course, they can. They're so emboldened right now, she thinks she can get away with saying this, and people in the audience don't laugh at her or stand up in that public setting and go, come on.STU: Every one on the panel, nods in vigorous agreement.GLENN: Nods their head. You don't think they can convince half the country, that you should be eliminated, liquidated. Put into a camp. Whatever authoritarians love to do.I got news for you, I would be saying the same exact thing. If people on the right were doing this.We are headed toward dangerous, dangerous times. We better wake up and stand together. Because this is a frightening -- it's hilarious. But because people are taking it seriously. It is a terrifying statement.   The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships.

New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy people on the left. The AOC's have taken over, places in the media.And places like this in New York.This is what it is thousand. So there's been one case. One. One in the entire seven years. Where they did this.Where they shut down a company, that had no obvious victims.The case was 1972.And it was a company, relatively small company, that was writing term papers, for college students. Okay.So I want to write my paper.GLENN: I want to break out in God bless America.STU: Capitalism is pretty impressive. Apparently, this didn't go over that well.What they said, there were no obvious victims here. The people bought the term papers. They didn't want to write them. They got the term papers. They said, they were defrauding the education system.GLENN: Which they were.STU: This is the one time. And it's a small tiny company. Let me give you the other times they've done this.Tell me if any of these sound like, hey, I have a good interest rate, on a loan I paid back.Number one, a breast cancer nonprofit was shut down a dozen years ago. For using nearly all its $9 million in donations to pay for director's salaries, perks, and other expenses, instead of funding free mammograms. Okay.So they told everyone, donate money for free. Mammograms. And they just took all the money for themselves.That's number one. Number two, a private equity timber.Faking big investment success, was closed down after stealing millions of dollars from thousands of investors.Okay?You can see.GLENN: Yeah. Got it. But on both of those so far, you have hundreds of thousands of people, you know, I'm sure. That gave -- they're all victims.They gave their money.STU: Yeah. And they didn't get the thing that they want.GLENN: They didn't get the thing they were promised. You have all these people going to the AG. Saying, hey, this is a real problem here. This has to stop. Not here.GLENN: Not here.STU: Another one. Mental health facility, shuttered for looting $4 million from public funds, while neglecting patients.GLENN: Okay. Kind of a big one.STU: Pretty clear. An auto lender that allegedly charged hidden interest rates, got to stay in business last year if it paid a fine and didn't commit fraud in the future.So here's one they didn't shut down.They actually let them go on.They're going after Trump in all of this. In this one, they're like, oh. Sure, they're hidden fees.They're not telling you about them.GLENN: Okay.STU: A judge requested.A judge refused to request to shut down a river rafting company in 2011.After a customer drowned, and the attorney general showed it was repeatedly using unlicensed guides, or none at all.Instead, he ordered only a 50,000-",,-2,-4
BECKNews_80," GLENN: The satanic temple has filed a complaint against Idaho on Friday, after filing a similar one in Indiana.The lawsuits, the temple is arguing that each state's ban violates the rights of people, who took contraception, and still became pregnant. Listen to this. Quoting, denying the right of an involuntary pregnant woman, to engage in the Satanic abortion ritual. This is not the Bee. This is not a parody.This is actually happening.  By the way, they're also suing Boston, because they want to give an invocation before city council meetings, just like all other religions. Yeah, going to say a big negatory on that one, Satan.     The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years.

Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO.

That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy people on the left. The AOC's have taken over, places in the media.And places like this in New York.This is what it is thousand. So there's been one case. One. One in the entire seven years. Where they did this.Where they shut down a company, that had no obvious victims.The case was 1972.And it was a company, relatively small company, that was writing term papers, for college students. Okay.So I want to write my paper.GLENN: I want to break out in God bless America.STU: Capitalism is pretty impressive. Apparently, this didn't go over that well.What they said, there were no obvious victims here. The people bought the term papers. They didn't want to write them. They got the term papers. They said, they were defrauding the education system.GLENN: Which they were.STU: This is the one time. And it's a small tiny company. Let me give you the other times they've done this.Tell me if any of these sound like, hey, I have a good interest rate, on a loan I paid back.Number one, a breast cancer nonprofit was shut down a dozen years ago. For using nearly all its $9 million in donations to pay for director's salaries, perks, and other expenses, instead of funding free mammograms. Okay.So they told everyone, donate money for free. Mammograms. And they just took all the money for themselves.That's number one. Number two, a private equity timber.Faking big investment success, was closed down after stealing millions of dollars from thousands of investors.Okay?You can see.GLENN: Yeah. Got it. But on both of those so far, you have hundreds of thousands of people, you know, I'm sure. That gave -- they're all victims.They gave their money.STU: Yeah. And they didn't get the thing that they want.GLENN: They didn't get the thing they were promised. You have all these people going to the AG. Saying, hey, this is a real problem here. This has to stop. Not here.GLENN: Not here.STU: Another one. Mental health facility, shuttered for looting $4 million from public funds, while neglecting patients.GLENN: Okay. Kind of a big one.STU: Pretty clear. An auto lender that allegedly charged hidden interest rates, got to stay in business last year if it paid a fine and didn't commit fraud in the future.So here's one they didn't shut down.They actually let them go on.They're going after Trump in all of this. In this one, they're like, oh. Sure, they're hidden fees.They're not telling you about them.GLENN: Okay.STU: A judge requested.A judge refused to request to shut down a river rafting company in 2011.After a customer drowned, and the attorney general showed it was repeatedly using unlicensed guides, or none at all.Instead, he ordered only a 50,000-dollar bond and cleanup -- for him to clean up his act.The company is still being run today, under a different name by the same family. Someone died.GLENN: We have thousands of victims.And in this case, somebody who is dead.STU: Is dead!GLENN: Dead!STU: They're like, you guys can stay open -- and then this one is my favorite one. A judge in 2001.Declined to appoint a receiver, to take over a porn site, despite millions of dollars of illegal credit card charges to hundreds of customers.Who thought they were getting a free tour.Now, look, you're -- you want to get the free -- you want to know what you're subscribing for, Glenn. Before you just pulled the trigger on that. So you put your credit card information into a porn site, I think some of these victims need some life changes to be made here.But they put their credit card into a porn site. Expecting a free tour.They instead, get charged and charged and charged and charged.In fact, once the owners of the site were caught, they attempted to move their money overseas, to avoid any penalty.Still, the judge said, appointing a receiver was an extraordinary remedy!That should be used sparingly, and that a preliminary injunction was good enough.Only after all that happened, it they find out, the people running the porn site, were the Gambino crime family.(laughter)I kid you not. The Gambino crime family.GLENN: And they didn't go into receivership.STU: So there you go. Think about that.I mean, it's so obvious, what they're doing. Latitia james talked about it when she ran.Her goal was to take this one individual out.And the New York -- the voters of New York, said, good.Go do it.And now she's doing it.GLENN: Okay. If you are -- if you have business in in New York, if you're in New York, I'm just telling you. You have to do what you have to do.There's no way, I would keep my business in New York.There is no rule of law now. You know it on the streets. But there is no rule of law. If they can get away with this. They can do anything to you.   Elon Musk has announced that the first Neuralink patient can now control a computer mouse by just thinking. But while this technology could help a lot of people, should we proceed with caution? Between AI and this new merger of man and machine, Glenn gives a warning about what the future could hold. Glenn and Stu also review the controversy surrounding Googles Gemini AI, which refused to generate images of white people.     Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: So the website, Down Detector, detected a surge in outage reports from users at AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Customer Cellular, Boost Mobile, US Cellular, and Straight Talk.That the reports of the system being downed or outages, began at 3:45 a.m. Eastern time. The outages have been reported across many major US cities.It looks like, that it is back up. I'm not sure.They say, they don't think this was a cyber attack.But how did all of them go down at the same time?I mean, that's kind of weird.Yesterday, Israel had a cyber attack.It was from Iran. The Israelis say. And it was an attack on their cell phone services.So quite a coincidence. But let's not jump to any conclusions. Let's see what actually happened.Cyber attacks are going to happen. At some point, soon. We will have cyber attacks. And it will leave you vulnerable, if that's what you depend on.We are becoming more and more, a society that is connected in all things, and absolutely incapable of doing any things, without our electronics.We hit a milestone yesterday. This is truly like landing a man on the moon, I think. This is -- this is the first real merging of man and machine, I think. I mean, we've had the electronic. You know, the bionic arms and things like that.But this is in your mind.It's Neuralink. Elon Musk came up with it. And it is really tempting, because this is -- you know, this will be great to some degree. You'll be able to access information, and have the old internet in your head. You want to speak French?Okay. Download it. Got it.I mean, it is really -- isn't that the Matrix?STU: Yeah. The Matrix too. We're turning into The Matrix. That's the theme of the show today. GLENN: So that is now the beginnings of that, happened and was announced yesterday. Elon Musk said, Neuralink is active in the first person, to have one of the chips implanted in their brain. They have seemingly made a full recovery.We -- you know, so far. We don't know what the effects of this are, or will be. But Musk said, the patient can now move the mouse around a screen, just by thinking.So he has Bluetoothed himself to the screen.Crazy. Huh.STU: It's incredible that they can do that. And, you know, also, look at the way Elon Musk does business.This is a lot of what he does. Which is a lot of kind of just -- let's try it. There's a lot of -- hey, let's give it a whirl.GLENN: He said I think yesterday or earlier this week, that he had plans by 2029, to have a million people on Mars.And when I heard that, I thought, there's no -- oh, it's Elon Musk. Maybe.STU: Well, yeah. And this is his goal, with all of this stuff. He has -- I think it's a T-shirt or something. He wears. Like occupy mars.This is the central idea of his life.GLENN: And this is part of it. Neuralink is part of it.He believes that we are on such a dystopian track right now. That because of global warming, but also because of AI.He believes AI is just as dangerous as global warming. He believes we cannot compete with AI.Unless we can merge with it. Okay.Because it will be operating at such high speeds. We don't have the processing capabilities for the speeds.You know, it's kind of like -- kind of like dogs. Dog life. Seven years. One year for us.It's like one year is a thousand years for AI.So it's moving at such a rapid speed, we won't be able to keep up. So he believes that we need to be able to merge with the machine, until we can get off, this planet.I don't think he'll be taking Neuralink with him. Or maybe he just thinks we won't have access to this AI on Mars.But that's really what is -- is driving him. Driving his whole life.STU: It's really, really hard.Because I know, it feels creepy. And there are risks. And all of that.But it's like, it's really, really hard to think about telling someone, who is paralyzed that, no. We could make you move. But we don't want to pursue that technology.Like, I don't know. I mean, it's just -- it's such incredible technology.And for all of the other stuff, that he's done. Which is really impressive. I mean, Elon Musk is an impressive dude.Space travel. You know, the electric car stuff. I don't care about the electric car stuff that much. But it's still really impressive what he's been able to do.Everyone basically said, you couldn't do it. And no other company could be able to do that. He did that. He's done so many incredible things. But if he was able to take people, you know, with disabilities. And all these -- these issues that have been unsolvable throughout all of human history, and somehow figure out a way to -- through Neuralink or something similar, to solve that for people, it would be the greatest thing he has ever accomplished by a long shot.GLENN: So my daughter Mary had brain surgery, about three, four years ago.STU: Yeah. I remember.GLENN: And it was perfect for a long time.All of her seizures went away. Earlier this year, I think it was in the summer, she started to have breakthrough seizures.And they are even on medication now, they are grand mal. They are --STU: Hmm.GLENN: They're just terrifying. And -- and I said to her, this was about four years ago.I said, honey, if you wait. Elon Musk is doing experience with Neuralink.And one of the things that Neuralink will do. Is it will -- you know, patch all of the brain damage.It will take where -- when you have a stroke, it's like a highway.And there's you all these highways running to different parts of your brain. And if you have a stroke, that highway is cut.So there are other paths to get to where it's going, but it makes it much slower. And sometimes it can't just get to where it's supposed to go.STU: You can't get there from here.GLENN: You can't get there from here.So Neuralink will connect the different parts of the brain, back to each other.And it doesn't need roadway. It's just Bluetooth to all the different parts of the brain, it needs.In effect --STU: Incredible.GLENN: Yeah. Incredible. Absolutely incredible.You know what she said to me.Dad, I think I'll wait.Because I know the savior will heal me, even if it's just in the afterlife.STU: Jeez.GLENN: What a giant.STU: Raised a good kid there, jeez.GLENN: I had nothing to do with it. Nothing to do with it.STU: That's incredible.GLENN: So we have this now. We have what I've been talking about, the singularity, the merging of man and machine. And also, what I've been talking -- I've been talking about this particular category for 30 years, plus. And I said, there's going to come a time, merging man and machine. There's also going to come a time, where you cannot believe your eyes or your ears. We're there now. Did you hear about -- what was her name.Bobbi Althoff. Did you read about this? Bobbi Althoff, apparently, a very sexually explicit video of -- she's a podcast perso",,0,0
BECKNews_81," In further efforts to curb speech, Democrat Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee recently introduced a new bill (the Leading Against White Supremacy Act of 2023) that is one of the most unconstitutional and radical pieces of legislation proposed in I dont know how many years, Glenn says. In this clip, Glenn explains the bill, which aims to prevent and prosecute acts of white supremacy (without really defining what white supremacy actually is). Then, Glenn shows how this bill relates to similar moves throughout history that ultimately have NOT ended well&    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: So let's -- let's start here, shall we? College kids now are learning to snitch on each other, through secret tip lines.This is Germany, West -- I'm sorry. East Germany, under the Soviets. They had the Stasi.And they would -- they -- they got people to snitch on each other.That is the one thing that people have always said about America. They'll come over, and they'll say, Americans are so nice.And they're so trusting. Well, it's not that we were that trusting. It's that Europe wasn't trusting. Nobody trusted each other.Because for centuries, they've turned each other in, for one reason or another. So keep it to yourself. Keep it to your family. What do they say is if we're open. Because we've never had that kind of thing. So when George Bush first promoted, hey, you see something, say something. Call the White House snitch line if you see something that your neighbor is doing.No. I mean, if I see my neighbor, and he's, you know, obviously something is wrong.I'll call the local police.Hey, can you just check this out?But I'm not watching my neighbor, and snitching on my neighbor.And that's what's happening right now. People are -- in college. This door room number, and this dorm room. Had a sign that said all solicitors must be able to define the word woman, and then the campus PC police come. Seventy-nine complaints at the University of Connecticut. There's a bathroom that is being identified based on gender.Oh, my gosh. No.Oh. There was some verbal remarks, directed at certain race. And gender identity at this comedian, that was on campus.Really?In Illinois, a student was reported for saying that there were only two genders, and reportingly not wanting to live with a roommate, who just makes stuff up in his head. That's no longer acceptable.Meanwhile, to further curb speech, Sheila Jackson Lee, has introduced the leading against white supremacy act of 2023.It is one of the most unconstitutional and radical pieces of legislation, proposed in -- I don't know how many years.The leading against white supremacy act, it aims to prevent and prosecute white supremacy inspired hate crime, and conspiracy to commit white supremacy inspired hate crime. Blah, blah, blah.So if you engage in what is described as white supremacy hate, and you inspire a hate crime, well, if it was used in the planning, development, preparation, or perpetration of any of the crime, you're responsible.And you go to prison. But they don't define exactly what white supremacy is. And white supremacy crimes are.Okay?Now, seems like a problem. You know, maybe.Especially when you say, there is no definition in the law of white supremacy ideology.And then, you know, the conspiracy provision. It's -- it makes it illegal to publish material, that inspires a crime.So if I publish something and somebody read it, some lunatic, and they were like, oh, my gosh. I've got to take this into my own hands. I'm going to go shoot down that Chinese weather balloon myself. This government would probably say, that was a crime.And if they were white, and they're like, yeah. And white power!I could be prosecuted. You could be prosecuted. It doesn't matter if they're mentally ill or not. This is kind of a -- a problem. Kind of a problem, for millions of Americans.Now, this is all happened before. All of this has happened before. There is nothing new under the sun. The question is: Are we going to learn from history and recognize the -- the problems and recognize the -- did -- what did -- historically, what did people do? Did it work, or did it not work? Did they do something or not do something?You can't just expect utopia to happen. Because utopia. You know what utopia -- is -- I mean, in a better world, it would be a coloring book. And it would be at best, fiction. The word utopia actually comes from the 16th century. And it was kind of a joke.Utopia, it came -- you know, it was written by Thomas Moore. And he took the Greek prefix for not or no, and the suffix for place. No place.That's what -- that's what utopia means. No place, or nowhere. Get it?So I think the book by Thomas Moore is a prediction of communism. It takes place on a fictional island called Utopia. It's an island of slavery, where poverty is cured by harmony. Crime is solved by equity. Private property, money, been abolished. Social classes have been unmasked, for what they really are.Conspiracy of the rich.And utopia, the island nowhere, achieved a complete equality of goods.Now, equality of goods. What they did was they just destroyed the meaning of all goods.Because everyone shares in a utopia. And to devalue currency, precious objects are treated like trash. People give diamonds to children, instead of marbles. They have chamber pots or toilets, made of gold. And even the chains on the slaves are made of gold, and traditional institutions mean nothing.Euthanasia is common on the island of Utopia.Because nobody really cares about the value of anything, including human life.Utopians always claim to be humanist. I just want to do what's best for all humans. And they offer that utopian view. And, again, it is the basis of Marxism and communism. And really, it's just all a lie.But it's a diversion. It's a delay tactic. Because people don't realize, this is a lie, until usually it's too late.Because it's a slow boil.Think of how -- you are accepting things now, that you wouldn't have accepted, 15 years ago. Ten years ago.Ten years ago, if I said, men could have babies too. Every liberal would have said, not possible.What are you talking about?Well, that's what you're going to tell me in about ten years. No, I'm not. That's ridiculous.You are not parroting and saying things that you know are nonsense.I'm speaking to America in general.And people are saying, right now, give me the power, so I can make you powerful.Yeah. And the choice is always, it's going to be Armageddon.It's going to be -- he's worse than Hitler.NASA -- he's worse than Trump. And Trump was worse than Hitler. Oh, wow. And what was Mitt Romney again?I mean, it's always a choice between utopia, we can't really define it. But we'll know it when we get there.And we can't tell you how we'll pay for it. But it will all be sugar plumb fairies and lollipops.It's wonderful.Or. Go ahead. You can roast in the fires of hell, with Satan and Armageddon. Go ahead.And they convince us, that the power of a nation should not belong to you. Everything belongs to you.Everything in your life, all of your thoughts, your actions, they belong to you.The things you have earned through merit, belong to you. And if you've, quote, earned something without merit, if you've just inherited it, you don't really own it.You really -- something becomes yours, when you've earned it. But all that goes out the window. The power of a nation doesn't belong to people. It's stuff.It should all belong to the state. So people, one by one, historically speaking, hand all of their power over to the state.And then the state decides what people should be. What they can say. What they can watch. What they can listen to.They define hate. You and I both know hate. We know hate when we see hate. We know love when we see love.I can tell you the difference between love and sex. There's a big difference.Love always wins. Sex doesn't always win. Utopians take the state, and turn it into the brain of society.And it controls everything.Now, think of this. This is from the 1600s. Think of this.The state becomes the brain of society. With AI and all of the technology we have today, they are literally trying to be the brain of society.And control everything and hold all of the power. It will do the thinking and deciding for everyone.In America, the first utopian, was Woodrow Wilson, really.The one with real power, he used centralization, and bureaucracy, to make a collectivism that Americans had never seen before.And then he spread it in all the universities. He convinced Congress, to give, hand them their power, so he could use war and surveillance to make a war safe for democracy. FDR took the step even further.He said, it would get rid of war altogether, with a little help from Josef Stalin.I -- we've seen all of these things before, and America turned. Just in time.Will we this time?Because there's -- there's one more example, that we should learn from. And it is from China.But remember, China is the new model, according to all the global leaders. All of the big capitalist leaders.And all the leaders of the -- the world, including Joe Biden.China is the new model. Well, let me tell you how they got there.In a minute. Sponsored by preborn. You know, every once in a while, I get to give you good news. And here's some good news. You know how many babies you have saved? How many babies have been born, just because of this audience?It's over, I think 55- or 60,000 babies, in the last 12 months, were saved because of you.Because somebody, if it wasn't you, somebody, you know, maybe in the car next to you, or the cubicle next to you, somebody was listening to this program. They were like, I'm going to donate 28 bucks. That bought an ultrasound for a woman who had come into a clinic, 55,000 of them, assuming there's no twins.And they walk in, and they say, I think I'm going to have an abortion.They saw the ultrasound, that cost 28 bucks. They didn't have to pay for it.And that made mom go, I'm going to -- that's a baby. I'm going to keep my baby.That's what you have done. And you can do it, for 28 bucks.I think it's 140 bucks. And what do you get? Six.I mean -- you really can save a bunch of baby's lives. Do it once a month, $28.Be a hero. Dial #250, and say the key word baby.That's #250.Key word baby. Or go to preborn.com/Glenn. Find out all the information.Preborn.com/Glenn.Go there now. Ten-second station ID.(music)GLENN: All right. I want to talk to you about the great cultural revolution here.Like every group utopian, Mao started with ideas. I got ideas.Slogans, basically, that sound good. But don't really mean anything. See if any of these sound familiar to you.Before long, the slogans are true.This is how he made every aspect of life, political. That way, anyone who disagreed with him, was conspiring against China. The great utopia.They weren't his opponents. They were the enemies of the people.This is why utopians always combine academia with the military. The academics dream up the new utopias, and the military forces people into those utopias. And Mao is really clever about this. He convinced people how they had a role in how things work. Your lives are political for a reason.This is how he got students to snitch on one another. Then get kids to betray their own parents, all in the names of the state.This is how you create a whole society of vigilantes. For Woodrow Wilson, he had the four-minutemen.That was his good news. For Mao. The red guards. Young activists, who served as his unofficial enforcers. In colleges, I just told you what the snitchers were. And they think they are doing good, just like these others did. The tech world, isn't that really the enforcer of the government now?One of the first utopians. One of the first utopians of the modern age, really was Mao.He was the most prolific at death. They take power to destroy history. That's the first thing.They say the world as we know it, China as we know it, has to be replanned. Reset.Because everything you know is old, dusty, and no longer any good.At the start of the cultural revolution, the red guard led a campaign to eradicate the four Olds.I want you to listen. Pesky. Four Olds.The four Olds. That they had to get rid of.The old customs.Christmas means nothing, Thanksgiving is a celebration of slavery, Fourth of July is a celebration. Get rid of the old customs.The -- the old culture.You needed new habits, and new ideas.The old history, had to be swept away.The old guard had to be swept away.They started, believe it or not, by tearing down statues, and changing the names of streets.Then they attacked anyone who tried to stop them. They destroyed people's homes. They publicly humiliated their opponents. And no one could stop them. Because people had already given Mao all their power.Before long, the Red Guard was destroying cemeteries and factories and libraries and museums and temples. Wow, they were burning down their own cities. What happens is, the same story over and over again. They want to reform the big institutions of society.But in the end, they only destroy the small institutions. Family, church, private property.And they always start with the idea, that you have a duty to the state. And the group is more important than the individual. And if that individual is speaking out, they have to be shut down.That was only the first installment of Mao's genocidal reign.    The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechani",,-6,-7
BECKNews_82," No logical person possibly could listen to President Bidens State of the Union and understand it, Glenn says, because it was completely full of LIES. In this clip, Glenn gives his thoughts on Bidens SOTU speech, explaining why it was one of the most bizarre things I have ever seen. Plus, Glenn reminds us  and, most importantly, Joe Biden  of one the most important aspects of the presidency: 'Perhaps you need a reminder of that oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.'     Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Last night was one of the most bizarre things I have ever seen. I -- our president was laughed at.Our president was lost and bewildered. I -- I -- there were parts of the speech, I literally could not understand.I've never seen anything like it. He introduced spending and control. That it's way beyond anything the United States of America has ever done.No mention of why we've spent $100 billion on Ukraine.You know, no answer on why we're doing it. What exactly we're doing. Just that we're committed from here until the end. I don't know what that means. About half of it, I felt like, he was saying, Trump was right. I mean, all of a sudden, he was America first. It was bizarre.China our greatest national security adversary, he used to laugh at that.Police, need more funding, not less.We have to have that funding, so we can attract the best cops and provide the best training.Wait. What? Social media platforms like TikTok are a danger to our children, and anything coming from China, should be banned. Wait?What? Buy American, and American first, now apparently, correct and moral.The US debt is too high, and has to be reduced to take the burden off our children.Now he's also talking about at the same time, the most spending programs in our history. And he then introduces that we're going to tax the rich some more for that.Because there's tax cheats out there. Uh-huh.Is that going to pay for all of this?He also said, now, I want you to really think -- think on this.He said, that from now on, 100 percent of building materials used in infrastructure and government construction projects, need to come from America.Okay.If that were true, we would have to open an estimated 400 new coal, copper, and iron ore mines.One hundred new steel mills. One hundred new aluminum refineries. We would have to cut down almost every tree in America.By the way, part of our US carbon emissions. The reason why they're 80 percent lower, than they were in 1995, is because we outsourced all of that stuff.So now you want to bring it here in America, while reducing our carbon emissions to zero.Not going to happen. Check out the cobalt mines in Africa. The copper mines in South America. We outsourced all of our steel refinement, to China, lumber to Canada and South America.What would requiring 100 percent of 2 trillion dollars of infrastructure spending, due to our goal of reaching 0 percent carbon by 2050?There's no answer there. There's no answer. It's delusional thinking.What would it just do if to -- the prices of stuff at Home Depot.If the United States of America decided to buy $2 trillion a year, of -- of all American product. You wouldn't have a chance of buying an American product.You know, I wondered after he was making promos after promise, what the Supreme Court justices thought. You know, there were four of them that didn't show up last night. I mean, just sitting there. And you were at all constitutionally based. You're like, well, that won't stand up, over and over again.A wealth tax, and a billionaire's only tax, unconstitutional. Forcing non-profitable corporations to pay 15 percent of income.Not profits, income. That's unconstitutional.Setting the price at which items can be sold. No matter the manufacturing, and business costs. No way. Just setting the price. Unconstitutional.And then he was laughed at.Look, I understand. I'm not going to shut down all the oil and gas here in America.And people are saying that.And that's not true. Because we are going to need oil and gas, I'm quoting, for another ten years.Another ten years! You just doomed half the world to a slow and painful death, from starvation. This was the most embarrassing moment, I've ever seen in a State of the Union address.The world is facing massive energy shortages. America is one of the largest energy producers in the world, due to coal, oil, and natural gas.Russia's oil and gas production, are supposedly off the market, for the next ten to 15 years.So the developing world, can't get it from Russia. Can't get it from us.They'll die off without any energy and food production.So to blind, you know, everybody. He's delusional. He's so incredibly -- I mean, I don't even know how a logical person can even look at that speech, and understand it, other than there's something wrong here.No notion. No notion.He says, the radical environmentalism, which he's pursuing. He says, it's an existential threat, that we have to take care of.No notion of how we're going to produce food and heat for the next, you know, eight balloon people.What you saw last night was states-sponsored religion. That's what you saw.He was the high priest. He came to the altar. And expected you to bow down and worship, at that altar. The first ever American state-sponsored religion. Because there's no logic to it. You just have to believe.I was also a little disappointed by Sarah Huckabee Sander's rebuttal speech. I mean, it's good. She told a story, setting Trump up for 2024.Giving an impassioned plea for what makes America great, but it was not a rebuttal.She didn't review anything. Any of the major points or policies in his speech. It was as if she wasn't watching the speech.And I think that is a huge mistake. You can't pre-write everything.I mean, I really -- I really like Sarah. I do.But the stump speech response from Republicans is just not enough. Imagine if we would have just deconstructed. You could have had ChatGPT doing it.Imagine if we could have deconstructed what Biden actually said. Some of the biggest applause lines. His biggest promises.Let me just throw a couple of these out at you.Imagine if she would have said something like, you know, Mr. President, you keep saying, let's finish the job. We would like to know what job it is you're trying to finish.Because we don't see the benefits happening to the United States of America.It is almost as if you're trying to finish the job of the fundamental transformation and destruction of America.But let's take you at your word.What you're suggesting we do as a nation, via our government, I'm not sure you understand what your job even is.Based on what you just demanded tonight. That are all the things that our government should do.That's not your job. Here's what an intelligent person, would have heard, in your speech.Let's finish the job.Of violating the Second Amendment, by disarming Americans. Preventing them from being able to defend themselves. Their families, and their homes.I don't want to finish that job. Let's finish the job, of violating the First Amendment. By continuing to follow our first ever state-sponsored religion of radical environmentalism.Destroying our energy industry. Ultimately, massively depopulating the planet. Dooming mankind to return, really, to the Middle Ages. Let's finish the job.Of violating the ninth and tenth amendments. By going on government spending sprees, including free health care for all.Free in-home disability care.Free college for all.A guaranteed job for anyone who wants one.Which would lead to catastrophic hyperinflation.Runaway debt. It would destroy everything. By the way, by the way, none of that is in our Constitution. Every single one of those was in the Soviet Constitution, however.Let's finish the job. Of what? Violating the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause by asking the top one percent of tax earners, who already pay more than 40 percent of all taxes to pay even more?Ensuring only that they're going to migrate out of the US to countries that ask them to actually pay their fair share.It would destroy our tax base.Or is that why you were trying to finish the job, overseas, and convince every western nation, that we all had to lock our tax rates together.Let's finish the job, in, what?Ukraine?Violating article, you, section eight. Which grants Congress the sole power. That's a quote. To declare war.Let's continue to fight 100-plus billion dollar per year proxy wars against Russia. In the Middle East.In Africa.Let's continue to drum up support for the next war, against, what?China?Let's finish the job of lying to our children. That the goal of American life is and must be equity of outcomes.Instead of teaching them about individual responsibility. Merit-based rewards for hard work or personal achievement. No, no, no. Let's finish the job.Let's finish the job of further depopulating the planet.By teaching young children, that abortion is the answer to pregnancy, if that is her or him -- his whims.According to the equal rights of the unborn child, as if killing a 5-year-old is the answer to the inconvenience of being a parent, or food shortages.Let's finish the job of, what? Turning Americans into a socialist, Soviet state. I refer you back to the Soviet Constitution.Where the government sets all the prices, takes over businesses, or you can go to the fascistic look, where it's a public/private partnership. Their words. The fascist words, not mine.But strangely yours. Where they come in, or they either take over the business, or they partner with the industries, to achieve social goals, demanding they produce drugs or hearing aids or music. And then must sell them at a price, if the government demands or decides is fair.I don't want to finish that job. Mr. President, I don't think you understand what finishing your job really means.Because it seems like you don't even know what your job is. And it's weird, because you've taken the oath of office, several times.And your job, the job of the American government, is to ensure and protect the liberty and freedom of each individual men, every man, woman, and child.What is it from the Declaration of Independence? Oh.And government are his instituted among men, to protect these rights.That's why in America, we even have a government.When you became a senator and then vice president and now president, you took an oath of office.There was no mention of jobs for all, free college, free health care, destroying our industries to follow your party's chosen scientist's whim on energy policy.Perhaps you need a reminder of that oath. To protect and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.By the way, the reason why you have a veto, is because you believe it to be unconstitutional.Not because you don't like it, but because you believe it is unconstitutional.But how many presidents even remember that? On both sides of the aisle?Let me ask you, Mr. President. When you stated your man. And your mission, do you not see it clearly violates the precepts and the texts of the Constitution. And what does that mean to you? However, to give credit, you know, where credit was due, you were right about one thing. We still do have a job to do.Except, I think we should finish the job our Founders started. To ensure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.That, sir, is the job!That is the job that is still left undone. Because it will never be totally finished ever.It's through human freedom and liberty, and meritocracy. That we will cure cancer.We will protect the environment.Lower health care costs.Plus, we'll improve the economy, and confront our enemies. As they arise.Because that's what Americans do, and every time there's a public/private partnership or government gets involved, it destroys the freedom.You know, it's the people, not higher taxes on a few people.Not through government controls of energy -- industries or price controls or wage and job guarantees.That enslave the few for the benefit of the many. That's not capitalism, sir.Although, you said twice last night, you're a capitalist. I don't think you even know what that means. It's another Z-word, constitutionalist, capitalist. That's socialism.That's Marx, Mao, Hitler, Putin, Xi. They each believed, well-intended for their people, but the path to hell.Your job as a public servant. It's singular and simple. To defend and protect the Constitution.So in the spirit of bipartisanships. Suck it up. Let's all hold hands.Let's finish that job. That's what should have been said last night.   The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechani",,-1,-2
BECKNews_83," Churches, people of faith, and religious institutions are under attack from all directions: the media, street activists, and perversions within the church itself. But now, Christians are fending off a government openly hostile to them for practicing the First Amendment.  The FBI is making moves on pro-life activists ?? at GUNPOINT ?? even though the non-violent cases are over a year old. Meanwhile, where are the FBI arrests for the violent pro-abortion members of Jane??s Revenge? Where are the FBI indictments for the over 170 attacks on Catholic targets since May 2020? There is a sinister left-wing agenda at play, and Glenn Beck exposes it and the false prophets leading the way on Wednesday night's episode of ""nn TV."" ??Church and state?? has been warped into ""ate VERSUS the church,?? and all signs point to continued escalation. Glenn explains why the government is intent on making extremists out of peaceful pro-lifers, like Paul Vaughn ?? another Christian ??extremist?? arrested by lethal force with his children watching. Paul faces up to 11 years in prison but tells Glenn why he won??t back down from his faith. Watch the full episode of "" TV"" below:   To enjoy more of Glenn??s masterful storytelling, thought-provoking analysis, and uncanny ability to make sense of the chaos, subscribe to BlazeTV ?? the largest multi-platform network of voices who love America, defend the Constitution, and live the American dream.  WRITER  Texas is under threat of a George Soros-backed takeover. Soros-funded RINO judges have been elected in some of the highest courts in Texas. These judges implemented restrictions that have block""nearly a thousand cases of voter fraud from being investigated or prosecuted from across the state. These new restrictions are similar to ones in place in states like George, Arizona, and Wisconsin, leaving Texas more susceptible to election corruption than ever. If Texas falls to corruption, America will lose its largest bastion of conservative electoral power in the nation. Without Texas, Republicans WILL NOT be able to win national elections and liberal corruption will go unchecked across the country.  Fortunately, there is a way to stop this: YOU. If you live in Texas you have a chance to stand up against corruption and to fight back! Starting Tuesday, February 20th, early voting for the primaries begins, where three of these judges are up for election. Go out and vote. If the right people are voted in, there's a good chance the restrictions will be lifted and election fraud can once again be prosecuted.  But remember, you can't just go in and vote for anyone who has an ""R"" next to their name. Sorors knows that a registered Democrat would never stand a chance in Texas, so his lackeys register as Republicans and ride the little ""R"" right into office. So who do you vote for?  Fortunately, Glenn had Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on his show today and Ken gave us his list of judges that he vouches for. His list is as follows:    WRITER  Who is really banning books? For years now, Conservatives have been taking flak from the left for supposed ""book bans."" The left likes to compare these ""bans"" to Nazi book burnings, accusing the right of sweeping authoritarian decrees designed to suppress information. In reality, this is a movement largely motivated by parents, who want to remove inappropriate books from children's libraries.  But if you want to discuss authoritarian book bans, look no further than the White House. As Glenn recently covered, the Biden administration has been pressuring the world's largest bookseller, Amazon, into suppressing books they disagree with. On February 5th, 2024, Ohio Representative Jim Jordan released a slew of subpoenaed documents that exposed pressure placed on Amazon by the Biden Administration. The documents, which Jordan dubbed ""The Amazon Files"" after Elon Musk's ""The Twitter Files,"" revealed an email conversation between Andrew Slavitt, a former White House senior adviser, and Amazon employees. In these emails, Slavitt complained that the top search results for books on ""vaccines"" were ""concerning"" and then requested that Amazon intervene. Amazon initially refused, not out of some altruistic concern for the free exchange of information. They thought any action taken would be ""too visible"" and would further exasperate the ??Harry/Sally narrative,?? referring to the outrage that followed Amazon's removal of Ryan T. Anderson??s book When Harry Became Sally.  Despite this initial refusal, Amazon agreed to meet with the White House a few days later. The number one item on their agenda was""oving books from the website. An Amazon employee even admitted that the reason they even took this meeting was due to the pressure being placed on them by the Biden Administration.  What was the result of this meeting? Amazon caved. They began to implement ways of limiting the outreach of books that challenged the mainstream vaccine narrative and other books the White House might not like. The White House was caught red-handed pressuring the world's largest bookseller to restrict the sale of books they consider in opposition to their narrative, and they have the gall to accuse conservatives of information suppression. This is just ONE of many actions committed by the Biden Administration that are more characteristic of a dictator than a president. What can you do about it? Fortunately, you are not dependent on Amazon and its corrupted algorithm to help you find books. Every week right here on GlennBeck.com, we highlight books that Glenn is reading or talking about in our ""Glenn's Bookshelf"" series.

WRITER   The left-wing media's most recent tirade is accusing Trump of being a dictator. But, as Glenn said, ""Everything they're accusing us of, they're doing."" Since day one, the Biden administration has overstepped the bounds placed on the executive branch set by the Constitution. In Glenn's most recent TV Special, he examined ten times Biden acted like a dictator, NOT a president. Here are 10 of Biden's Dictator Moves, and click HERE to get ALL of the research that went into this week's Glenn TV special:     WRITER   Every day it seems Glenn covers another story revealing how people across the world at all levels of power DESPISE the fact that YOU have rights, and they are actively trying to curtail them. Recently, there has been a string of attacks against the rights outlined in the First Amendment: the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, the freedom of assembly, and the freedom to petition. As a refresher, the First Amendment reads as follows: This is powerful stuff, there is a good reason the Founding Fathers made it the FIRST Amendment. It's also the reason why power-hungry elites are attacking it. These attacks are designed to control the way you think, speak, and believe, vote, what you read, and who holds your representatives responsible. The First Amendment is our strongest weapon against tyrants, and they know it. So what can you do about it? Hope that some wig in Washinton will eventually do something? We know how well that works. The best thing to do is to stay active, engage in the issues you care about, and exercise your rights.  So where to start? Here are a few things YOU can do to protect your First Amendment rights:                                Religion                                   The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is toyou guessed itpractice your faith. Become an active member in your place of worship, go to scripture studies, invite your friends to that late afternoon event, and walk the life. This can impact the way you spend money as well. Shop the businesses and brands that share your values, and don't shop at the ones that scorn them. Keeping the community alive and healthy is the best way to ensure that generations to come will be able to experience the freedom you enjoy.                              Speech                                   Much like religion, the best way to protect your freedom of speech is... to speak. Engage your friends and family in polite, civil conversation. Stand up for what you believe in, and make your case to your peers. Just remember to keep it friendly. No one ever won an argument by shouting down their opponent. The civil exchange of ideas is the cornerstone of our republic, and a dialogue where the participants are well-informed, considerate, compassionate, and open-minded can have permanent impacts on all involved.                              Press                                   Freedom of the Press seems a little tricky at first. Unless you work for the media, what are you supposed to do? Quit your job and go work for the local newspaper? The good news is that exercising this right is not nearly that difficult. In fact, you are currently doing it. The best thing you can do is to read from outlets that produce informative content. Want to know what Glenn consumes to stay informed every day?

Assembly                                    Anna Moneymaker / Staff | Getty ImagesFreedom of assembly is one of the more impactful yet underutilized freedoms in the First Amendment. Peaceably assembling and protesting with like-minded individuals can hugely influence politicians and policies while simultaneously creating community and fellowship between attendees. It's understandable why more people don't turn out. We're all busy people with busy schedules, and flying out to D.C. for the weekend seems like a daunting task to many. Thankfully, you don't have to go out all the way to D.C. to make a difference. Gather some like-minded people in your town and bring awareness to issues that impact your community. Big change starts locally, and exercising your freedom to assemble can be the catalyst to lasting impact.                               Petition                                   If you've been a long-time listener of Glenn, then you will have heard a few of his calls to action where he asks his audience to contact their representatives about a particular piece of policy. There is a good reason Glenn keeps on doing those: they work. Whether it's your local mayor or your senator, a call and an email go a long way. If you really want to make a change, convince your friends and family to reach out as well. The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is to??you guessed it??practice your faith. Become an active member in your place of worship, go to scripture studies, invite your friends to that late afternoon event, and walk the life. This can impact the way you spend money as well.

BECKNews_84," The far-left TRULY has lost all sense of reality, and UC Berkeley law professor Khiara Bridges just proved it. During a U.S. Senate hearing this week called Abortion Access and The Law, Bridges made some OUTLANDISH claims about Sen. Josh Hawley during his questioning. But Glenn and the guys discuss how the worst part of the exchange is Bridges' arrogance throughout it all  which, Glenn explains, actually may be the lefts flaw that ultimately causes their defeat&    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Did you guys hear the testimony yesterday, on -- on, you know, who can give birth. Abortion testimony, from -- from -- holy cow. Let me see -- yeah. We have it?PAT: Uh-huh.GLENN: This is from yesterday's -- yesterday's hearing. It's a law professor, from UC Berkeley. And she's talking to Josh Hawley, and he's -- he's asking about, can men get pregnant? Listen to this.VOICE: You've referred to people with a capacity for pregnancy. Would that be women?VOICE: Many women, cis women have the capacity for pregnancy. Many cis women do not have the capacity for pregnancy. There are also trans men who are capable of pregnancy, as well as nonbinary who are capable of pregnancy.VOICE: So this isn't really a women's rights issue.VOICE: We can recognize that this impacts women, while also recognizing that it impacts other groups. Those things are not mutually exclusive, Senator Hawley.VOICE: All right. So your view is that the core of this -- this right then is about, what?VOICE: So I want to recognize that your line of questioning is transphobic, and it opens up trans people to violence, by not recognizing that --VOICE: I'm opening people up to violence, by asking whether or not women are the folks who can have pregnancies?VOICE: So I want to note that one out of five trans gender persons have attempted suicide. So I think it's important --VOICE: Because of my line of questioning? So we can't talk about it?VOICE: Because denying that trans people do exist, and pretending not to know they exist.VOICE: I'm denying that trans people exist by asking you if you're talking about --VOICE: Are you? Are you?VOICE: -- women having pregnancies.STU: Oh, my God.PAT: That's agonizing.STU: It's like a religious detection to being stupid.PAT: Yeah. It is. Yeah, it is.STU: I wish they would be dedicated to something some other pursuit. What is this?We all know, what we're talking about. She's acting as if Josh Hawley asking if this is a woman's rights issue is causing suicides. It's insanity.PAT: So ridiculous.STU: No person -- no human being could possibly believe that. Yet, there she is, blurting it out. And acting super confident, like she's got a big Twitter zinger she's about to post. It's amazing.PAT: They have completely abandoned reality.GLENN: You know what is crazy is, absolutely abandoned reality. And they plant their flag in that invisible universe.And they're standing on no ground whatsoever. And they're like, yeah. That's right. People can fly.People can't fly. Are you saying that people who just jump off of buildings, can't fly. You know, people are committing suicide, because of your denial that people can fly. What are you talking about?STU: No. The suicide is that they keep jumping off of buildings. That's the problem.GLENN: Yeah. Right. She went on. Here she is. On the value of an unborn baby.VOICE: You think a baby that is delivered alive, has value?VOICE: Yes.VOICE: Do you think a a baby that is not yet born, has value?VOICE: I believe that a person with a capacity for pregnancy, has value. They have intelligence. They have agency. They have abilities.VOICE: You said the baby.VOICE: And I'm talking about the person with the capacity --VOICE: I'm answering a more interesting question to me.STU: That's not how this works, dear.VOICE: You think a baby who is not yet born, let's say a day before this mother delivers. Do you think that baby has value?VOICE: I think that the person with the capacity for pregnancy has value, and they have the -- they should have the ability to control what happens to their lives.PAT: Wow. Unreal.GLENN: Can you imagine? Can you even mangle, in her -- in her classroom, if you wrote a paper. And you said, and they said, you know, I want it to be about abortion, whatever.And you talked about giraffes. And they -- you turned the paper, and it's all about giraffes. And she would say, well, that's not the topic, that we were talking about. I know. But this is a more interesting paper.Do you think -- do you think they would accept that?STU: This person is convinced that she's about 100 times smarter than she is, that's what's fascinating to me about that clip more than anything. Because she's so arrogant. Super confident. And it's interesting, we played -- look, we do this all the time. Right? We play clips of liberals looking stupid, and answering questions in dumb ways, and getting caught in their ridiculous logic. We do that all the time. It's a fun part of the show. What's interesting about this clip in particular though, it's going -- it's going viral on the left too, as if she won.Like as if this was a good moment.PAT: My gosh.STU: For her. As it -- because she's so confident.PAT: Are you kidding me?STU: And going back at those -- those.GLENN: On the right, who aren't acknowledging trans people or whatever they're saying. Like, no person who is connected to reality, could possibly think she won these arguments. She's just completely. She's talking around it with, like, language tricks, to try to deny the reality of the situation. When it's so plainly obvious to any person who has ever lived on this earth, that he's right. But we're still going to act like she's right, because she said it with confidence.GLENN: So you don't -- you don't come out and say things like this, and be this arrogant your first time. You know, your first time, and you're like, hey. Women and children can -- men can be pregnant as well.The first time that was ever uttered, outside of university, it was most likely uttered like, now hear me out. Hear me out. These people are in their own circles. So tight, where there is no dissent. That it gives her the arrogance to look down her nose, at anyone who thinks differently. And they all -- I can guarantee you, she left that hearing, and the people around her went, you killed them. You killed them.STU: Uh-huh.GLENN: Because all of the people around her, are of groupthink.Nobody is looking, did you advance the ball at all?Did you convince anyone?No. I just told them off. Because they're too stupid.STU: Yeah. And, Glenn, what you described there, I would argue is our greatest hope.The fact that they are so far in in these circles. And are so convinced they're right, of just nonsense. That any average person can decipher and think is insane, is the best thing that's happened in conservatism, in 50 years.PAT: And if Republicans use this, in November, they will win.They will -- I would use this --STU: It's the only way to beat this. They have all the institutions. They have all the power. They have the media. They have all these things. But the fact that they're so confident. And so overstepping reality, is the only thing, we have on our side. The only thing we have is the truth.GLENN: So do you remember when we would gather every morning, when we were in New York, and we would get down on our knees, and we would pray every day. And we were so worried about things. And we prayed and prayed on, okay.Can you throw us a lifeline here? Where are we going? And do you remember the answer? Do you remember the answer I got? In their arrogance.PAT: Uh-huh.GLENN: They will fail. And they weren't arrogant at that point. And that's why I tried to kind of goad them. Remember I went on the -- and I said, they want to tell you. They want to tell you that they're Marxists. They can't wait to tell you.PAT: Right.GLENN: I was hoping to goad them into that. It didn't work. But look at -- look at where they are.PAT: Yeah.GLENN: We're doing a special tonight. Yeah. We're doing a special tonight on the -- on the planning that is going on now. The Women's March training that is going on right now. We have behind the scenes video of it.We had somebody go in, and take the training with them.And it's pretty powerful. But we're looking at all the people, who are behind all of the things that you are seeing.It's no longer hard to find. You know -- it used to be, well, that person was in the room, with this person. And this person is a communist.And so it was always at least 1 degree of separation. Now it is full-on. Full-on. I think we have video tonight, showing you the -- Ocasio-Cortez, being handled at a rally by the Communist Party.PAT: Jeez.GLENN: I mean, they don't care anymore. They just don't care.PAT: No.GLENN: And I -- I don't think Americans are down with all of this. I just don't. Again, for the third time, already this morning. Maybe it's just me.   The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy people on the left. The AOC's have taken over, places in the media.And places like this in New York.This is what it is thousand. So there's been one case. One. One in the entire seven years. Where they did this.Where they shut down a company, that had no obvious victims.The case was 1972.And it was a company, relatively small company, that was writing term papers, for college students. Okay.So I want to write my paper.GLENN: I want to break out in God bless America.STU: Capitalism is pretty impressive. Apparently, this didn't go over that well.What they said, there were no obvious victims here. The people bought the term papers. They didn't want to write them. They got the term papers. They said, they were defrauding the education system.GLENN: Which they were.STU: This is the one time. And it's a small tiny company. Let me give you the other times they've done this.Tell me if any of these sound like, hey, I have a good interest rate, on a loan I paid back.Number one, a breast cancer nonprofit was shut down a dozen years ago. For using nearly all its $9 million in donations to pay for director's salaries, perks, and other expenses, instead of funding free mammograms. Okay.So they told everyone, donate money for free. Mammograms. And they just took all the money for themselves.That's number one. Number two, a private equity timber.Faking big investment success, was closed down after stealing millions of dollars from thousands of investors.Okay?You can see.GLENN: Yeah. Got it. But on both of those so far, you have hundreds of thousands of people, you know, I'm sure. That gave -- they're all victims.They gave their money.STU: Yeah. And they didn't get the thing that they want.GLENN: They didn't get the thing they were promised. You have all these people going to the AG. Saying, hey, this is a real problem here. This has to stop. Not here.GLENN: Not here.STU: Another one. Mental health facility, shuttered for looting $4 million from public funds, while neglecting patients.GLENN: Okay. Kind of a big one.STU: Pretty clear. An auto lender that allegedly charged hidden interest rates, got to stay in business last year if it paid a fine and didn't commit fraud in the future.So here's one they didn't shut down.They actually let them go on.They're going after Trump in all of this. In this one, they're like, oh. Sure, they're hidden fees.They're not telling you about them.GLENN: Okay.STU: A judge requested.A judge refused to request to shut down a river rafting company in 2011.After a customer drowned, and the attorney general showed it was repeatedly using unlicensed guides, or none at all.Instead, he ordered only a 50,000-dollar bond and cleanup -- for him to clean up his act.The company is still being run today, under a different name by the same family. Someone died.GLENN: We have thousands of victims.And in this case, somebody who is dead.STU: Is dead!GLENN: Dead!STU: They're like, you guys can stay open -- and then this one is my favorite one.

BECKNews_85," With the midterms now less than four weeks away, Glenn Beck reveals what the polls aren??t telling you. Is there a silent voter base that will totally disrupt the outcome of the election and stun Democrats again?  President Biden??s White House seems to have a massive blind spot. The administration has prioritized pardoning everyone convicted of marijuana possession, abortion on demand, canceling student loan debt, and promoting sex-change surgeries for children. It??s like Democrats are governing some virtual reality game version of America.  BlazeTV hosts Stu Burguiere and Steve Deace join in cutting through the Democrat and media noise to explain the issues that could unleash a red wave, and Matthew Peterson of Firebrand PAC has a challenge for Americans who think the republic is too lost and the GOP is too feeble for their vote to make a difference come November 8.   Watch the full episode of ""nn TV"" below:   To enjoy more of Glenn??s masterful storytelling, thought-provoking analysis, and uncanny ability to make sense of the chaos, subscribe to BlazeTV ?? the largest multi-platform network of voices who love America, defend the Constitution, and live the American dream. WRITER  Texas is under threat of a George Soros-backed takeover. Soros-funded RINO judges have been elected in some of the highest courts in Texas. These judges implemented restrictions that have block""nearly a thousand cases of voter fraud from being investigated or prosecuted from across the state. These new restrictions are similar to ones in place in states like George, Arizona, and Wisconsin, leaving Texas more susceptible to election corruption than ever. If Texas falls to corruption, America will lose its largest bastion of conservative electoral power in the nation. Without Texas, Republicans WILL NOT be able to win national elections and liberal corruption will go unchecked across the country.  Fortunately, there is a way to stop this: YOU. If you live in Texas you have a chance to stand up against corruption and to fight back! Starting Tuesday, February 20th, early voting for the primaries begins, where three of these judges are up for election. Go out and vote. If the right people are voted in, there's a good chance the restrictions will be lifted and election fraud can once again be prosecuted.  But remember, you can't just go in and vote for anyone who has an ""R"" next to their name. Sorors knows that a registered Democrat would never stand a chance in Texas, so his lackeys register as Republicans and ride the little ""R"" right into office. So who do you vote for?  Fortunately, Glenn had Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on his show today and Ken gave us his list of judges that he vouches for. His list is as follows:    WRITER  Who is really banning books? For years now, Conservatives have been taking flak from the left for supposed ""book bans."" The left likes to compare these ""bans"" to Nazi book burnings, accusing the right of sweeping authoritarian decrees designed to suppress information. In reality, this is a movement largely motivated by parents, who want to remove inappropriate books from children's libraries.  But if you want to discuss authoritarian book bans, look no further than the White House. As Glenn recently covered, the Biden administration has been pressuring the world's largest bookseller, Amazon, into suppressing books they disagree with. On February 5th, 2024, Ohio Representative Jim Jordan released a slew of subpoenaed documents that exposed pressure placed on Amazon by the Biden Administration. The documents, which Jordan dubbed ""The Amazon Files"" after Elon Musk's ""The Twitter Files,"" revealed an email conversation between Andrew Slavitt, a former White House senior adviser, and Amazon employees. In these emails, Slavitt complained that the top search results for books on ""vaccines"" were ""concerning"" and then requested that Amazon intervene. Amazon initially refused, not out of some altruistic concern for the free exchange of information.

Anderson??s book When Harry Became Sally.  Despite this initial refusal, Amazon agreed to meet with the White House a few days later. The number one item on their agenda was""oving books from the website. An Amazon employee even admitted that the reason they even took this meeting was due to the pressure being placed on them by the Biden Administration.  What was the result of this meeting? Amazon caved. They began to implement ways of limiting the outreach of books that challenged the mainstream vaccine narrative and other books the White House might not like. The White House was caught red-handed pressuring the world's largest bookseller to restrict the sale of books they consider in opposition to their narrative, and they have the gall to accuse conservatives of information suppression.

WRITER   The left-wing media's most recent tirade is accusing Trump of being a dictator. But, as Glenn said, ""Everything they're accusing us of, they're doing."" Since day one, the Biden administration has overstepped the bounds placed on the executive branch set by the Constitution. In Glenn's most recent TV Special, he examined ten times Biden acted like a dictator, NOT a president.

Recently, there has been a string of attacks against the rights outlined in the First Amendment: the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, the freedom of assembly, and the freedom to petition. As a refresher, the First Amendment reads as follows: This is powerful stuff, there is a good reason the Founding Fathers made it the FIRST Amendment. It's also the reason why power-hungry elites are attacking it. These attacks are designed to control the way you think, speak, and believe, vote, what you read, and who holds your representatives responsible. The First Amendment is our strongest weapon against tyrants, and they know it. So what can you do about it? Hope that some wig in Washinton will eventually do something? We know how well that works. The best thing to do is to stay active, engage in the issues you care about, and exercise your rights.  So where to start? Here are a few things YOU can do to protect your First Amendment rights:                                Religion                                   The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is toyou guessed itpractice your faith.

Speech                                   Much like religion, the best way to protect your freedom of speech is... to speak. Engage your friends and family in polite, civil conversation. Stand up for what you believe in, and make your case to your peers. Just remember to keep it friendly. No one ever won an argument by shouting down their opponent. The civil exchange of ideas is the cornerstone of our republic, and a dialogue where the participants are well-informed, considerate, compassionate, and open-minded can have permanent impacts on all involved.

BECKNews_86,"  	As the left continues to fall apart in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, a few notable celebrities, such as Green Day singer Billie Joe Armstrong and liberal filmmaker Michael Moore have threatened to give up their U.S. citizenship in protest of restrictive abortion laws in conservative states. Too bad they have obviously never bothered to educate themselves about what abortion laws actually look like in other countries before exposing their own embarrassing ignorance to the world.   	""I cannot in good conscience continue to receive the privileges of ??full citizenship?? in this land when all of its women and girls have now been, by Court decree, declared official second-class citizens with no rights to their own bodies and conscripted to a life of Forced Birth should they fall pregnant and not want to be,""oore declared on Monday.   	From the reactions on Twitter, it doesn't look like Moore's threat had the intended effect.   	Filling in for Glenn Beck on the radio program Tuesday, Pat Gray and Stu Burguiere went over some of the most ridiculous celebrity reactions to overturning Roe v. Wade and exposed the truth about how restrictive abortion laws really are in other countries.    	Watch the video clip below. Can't watch? Download the podcast here.

WRITER  Texas is under threat of a George Soros-backed takeover. Soros-funded RINO judges have been elected in some of the highest courts in Texas. These judges implemented restrictions that have blocked nearly a thousand cases of voter fraud from being investigated or prosecuted from across the state. These new restrictions are similar to ones in place in states like George, Arizona, and Wisconsin, leaving Texas more susceptible to election corruption than ever. If Texas falls to corruption, America will lose its largest bastion of conservative electoral power in the nation. Without Texas, Republicans WILL NOT be able to win national ele""ons and liberal corruption will go unchecked across the country.  Fortunately, there is a way to stop this: YOU. If you live in Texas you have a chance to stand up against corruption and to fight back! Starting Tuesday, February 20th, early voting for the primaries begins, where three of these judges are up for election. Go out and vote. If the right people are voted in, there's a good chance the restrictions will be lifted and election fraud can once again be prosecuted.  But remember, you can't just go in and vote for anyone who has an ""R"" next to their name. Sorors knows that a registered Democrat would never stand a chance in Texas, so his lackeys register as Republicans and ride the little ""R"" right into office. So who do you vote for?  Fortunately, Glenn had Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on his show today and Ken gave us his list of judges that he vouches for. His list is as follows:    WRITER  Who is really banning books? For years now, Conservatives have been taking flak from the left for supposed ""book bans."" The left likes to compare these ""bans"" to Nazi book burnings, accusing the right of sweeping authoritarian decrees designed to suppress information. In reality, this is a movement largely motivated by parents, who want to remove inappropriate books from children's libraries.  But if you want to discuss authoritarian book bans, look no further than the White House. As Glenn recently covered, the Biden administration has been pressuring the world's largest bookseller, Amazon, into suppressing books they disagree with. On February 5th, 2024, Ohio Representative Jim Jordan released a slew of subpoenaed documents that exposed pressure placed on Amazon by the Biden Administration. The documents, which Jordan dubbed ""The Amazon Files"" after Elon Musk's ""The Twitter Files,"" revealed an email conversation between Andrew Slavitt, a former White House senior adviser, and Amazon employees. In these emails, Slavitt complained that the top search results for books on ""vaccines"" were ""concerning"" and then requested that Amazon intervene. Amazon initially refused, not out of some altruistic concern for the free exchange of information. They thought any action taken would be ""too visible"" and would further exasperate the ??Harry/Sally narrative,?? referring to the outrage that followed Amazon's removal of Ryan T. Anderson??s book When Harry Became Sally.  Despite this initial refusal, Amazon agreed to meet with the White House a few days later.

BECKNews_87," For Bill OReilly, the biggest story of the week is President Biden causing panic and unhappiness with his eerie warning during a Thursday speech of a possible Armageddon. Joe warned the world that America is as close to nuclear war as we were during the 1960s Cuban Missile Crisis. But OReilly tells Glenn that the presidents words will only EMPOWER Putin  who OReilly says is mentally ill  even further. So, where does this place the United States, Russia, and the possibility of future war? In this clip, Glenn and Bill discuss it all&    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Mr. Bill O'Reilly.The biggest story of the week, sir.BILL: I think Biden saying that Armageddon may be -- yeah.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.BILL: I think that's kind of big, right?GLENN: Yeah. I think that's kind of big.BILL: That would be big if Armageddon.GLENN: Yeah. Kind of huge. Kind of huge.BILL: Yes. I think I'm going to buy that Ferrari over the weekend.GLENN: Don't have to worry about paying for it, for long.BILL: Yeah. You know, 60 years ago, Beck, I know you're a student of history, John F. Kennedy was telling the nation, to build fallout shelters. You might want to dig a hole in the backyard, so you and the fam can get in there, after the big one hits.And Kennedy was dead serious, because that thing was hurling out of control, as the Soviet Union, Nikita Khrushchev wanted to move intercontinental missiles to Havana. And then, you know, we said, no. That's not going to happen. And so the confrontation on the high seas was in motion. And the Soviet Union pulled back.GLENN: Okay. So wait. Wait. Let me compare that. And ask you a specific comparison question. I believe Khrushchev was bluffing. He wouldn't have pushed the button. And Kennedy didn't want him to push the button, but if there was a war, each of them would have fought it. But they didn't want to fight that war, so it was just right up to the brink, which one is going to blink.BILL: Yeah. And that's what Khrushchev did.GLENN: Right. Do you believe the same can be said about Biden and Putin?BILL: No. Because I think Putin is mentally ill. So Khrushchev, I was a ruthless dictator, but there was no evidence, he was mentally ill. I think Putin is mentally ill. And that's the wild card here. But it does no good, for anyone, to have the president of the United States going, well, you know, on Thursday, it might be Armageddon.That doesn't do anyone any good. All right. It creates panic, unhappiness. Angst, whatever word you want to use. And it empowers Putin. Oh, look at this, I got them all scared over there.That's what goes through that little jerk's mind.GLENN: So, you know, Kennedy. Kennedy said, you might want to start building some fall out shelters. And everyone was aware of how high the steaks were. I don't think we are -- I don't think that people believe that the steaks are this high. That we are in this position. Even though the government -- I don't know if you saw this. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did a press release. They purchased $300 million of an acute radiation sickness medication. This is not iodine pills.This is -- these are, you know, bags of medicine for IV, that have to be kept in refrigeration. And they expire in 18 months.We just bought, for the very first time, 300 million dollars' worth of these IV bags. They expire in 18 months.What do you think that is?BILL: I saw that. Okay. That's a little preventive medicine.We're not going to get it. By the way, Beck, you and me. We're not getting it. I mean, those would be for the favored few.But you have to look at this as a geopolitical chess game. And so Biden by saying Armageddon empowers Putin. That's not what you want to do.You don't want to do anything here. You want to let Putin go down. He is. He is going down. All right.And you don't want to be -- inject yourself into his demise.Now, is there a chance that Putin would launch a low-level nuke in Ukraine?Yeah. There's a chance. It's ain't good chance. Because I believe, that his Army, would overthrow him.GLENN: Yes.BILL: If he tried to do that. And what people don't understand is, that U.S. intelligence, we're talking to those Russian generals now. All right. We -- we have good Intel out of Russia. And if you've read Killing the Killers, my book, I explain how -- if -- these guys do this in secret.So Vlad gets up one moment and says, okay. We're going to launch a nuke at Kiev. He can't just do that. There's a series of steps that have to be taken. And the U.S. would know that almost immediately.GLENN: Yeah. And they're -- they're. If I'm not mistaken. And, Bill, you might know this. I don't know. But if I'm not mistaken, their missile-launching system, is much more complicated than ours.It -- it -- you know, the president and one person, I think, at the White House, has to -- or the -- the head of the Defense Department. Or something. Has to okay it.And then they can flip it. But they, I believe, have to go through generals. Do they not?BILL: Yeah. Look, I'm not an expert of internal Soviet military matters. But I do know through the research of Killing the Killers. That in order to do that kind of an offensive gesture. Use a nuclear weapon.There are a number of steps that you have to take.I mean, he would have to consult with the Duma. Okay?I mean, you just can't do it.So what Biden and the mistake that Biden always makes is. He does he doesn't understand the big picture.He just doesn't. And he blurts stuff out. I can't imagine Klain or Rice telling him, hey. Why don't you just spook everybody, and say Armageddon might happen? I can't imagine that, all right?Because it doesn't fit any positive for the Democratic Party to do that. So probably, he heard something somewhere in a briefing. This is Biden. Because he gets an Intel briefing every morning.Sometimes he sleeps through it, doesn't get up in time. But it's scheduled, where the Intel people come in. And they're telling him, what's happening in Russia, and what's happening in Ukraine. And he probably heard something, and then just blurts it out. This is just educated speculation on my part, but I don't think I'm wrong.GLENN: So are we headed there? Or not?BILL: No. You can't do that. Headed there? You're dealing with an emotionally disturbed individual, Putin, who does have power. Okay?That's true. But Putin is constrained by China. You think China wants a nuke launched?You think China is going to play into that. No.GLENN: No. But you could make the case, that if Russia and America destroyed themselves, they could be there for the rebuild.BILL: Well, whatever it is, if there's a nuke launched, the whole world economic crashes. Okay? Everybody knows that.GLENN: Yeah. True.BILL: And, you know, Putin signs his death warrant, if he would ever do that. Then, you know, the USA and China could ban together and assassinate the man. I mean, that would happen. You just can't -- you know, it's not just going to happen. You can't just do that with no blowback.And Putin, as mentally ill, I believe he is. He doesn't want to die.He doesn't have a death wish. All right?He still has enough toys and stuff, to keep him occupied. But the big story, when you ask -- what's the big story of the week, is that the reaction from Biden is not smart.Is anybody surprised?GLENN: No. All right. So let me switch subjects. Because I agree with you. That's the big story of the week. The second biggest, I think is the attack of the FBI.Where the FBI is going after pro-lifers now.Oh. And also, that the HHS. Has just funneled 750,000 dollars, to an abortion activist group. So our tax dollars are now going to support abortion activists, while the government is rounding up, you know, 84-year-old grandmas. And threatening them with 11 years in prison.BILL: You know, this story is ill-defined for me.There are federal laws, as you know, that you cannot do certain things in front of abortion clinics. These people clearly broke the law.GLENN: No. No. They had a misdemeanor.It was just --BILL: All right. Whether it's the misdemeanor, or whatever it may be. I'm not there. I don't know.I haven't seen a complaint. Is it an overreaction? Of course, it is. And it's an overreaction to put the abortion issue in front of the American people again, before the midterm elections.That's why these things happen. That's why the raid on Mar-a-Lago. That's why the abortion thing. It's all about politics.Democrats believe that they will get waxed, and they will. And so what do we have? We have Trump. We have abortion. We don't have anything else. Here's the best stat of the week, I can give you. And Stu. Is Stu there, or is he asleep?STU: I'm both here, and asleep.BILL: Okay. There are hundreds of Democrats running for national office, this November. Hundreds.Not one has asked Joe Biden to campaign for him or her. Can I use those pronouns? Okay. Not one.That -- that is beyond stunning. You think somewhere, Silicon Valley. LA. The mayor of LA running. You think somewhere, Joe. Could you just stop by and say a few kind words about me?No. No one.What does that tell you?GLENN: He's not popular. He's not popular.BILL: Radioactive, pardon the pun.GLENN: Yeah.BILL: Radioactive.So the Democratic Party knows -- I love Nancy Pelosi going on Colbert. I think Colbert is her adopted son, by the way.I don't know if you know that.GLENN: Is anyone even watching Colbert anymore?BILL: Nobody watches. But it gets out on the internet. And Nancy.We'll hold the house. And then I'll go and get that little Dorothy and Toto. And he's just sitting there going, no, you're not.You -- and that's it for I, Nancy, baby. That's it. You're through. You won't run again. You'll go back to San Francisco and lie in the gutter with all the other people.GLENN: At you see that Biden, again, trying to buy votes. He pardoned everybody in federal prison. Who -- who, you know, was caught with -- with --BILL: Marijuana. Yeah.GLENN: But they're -- there's nobody in federal prison for that. Nobody.BILL: Nobody. But there are 6,000 people over the past 50 years, who were convicted of possession, in a federal court. Six thousand over 50 years. Okay. Now, why would those people, were they just smoking pot behind the shed?No. They plead it down. They were dealers. And they pleaded down to possession. Okay. This is if people don't know this.So if Biden goes, you know, I'm just going to pardon all of them. Well, I don't care. You know, fine. Pardon them.It doesn't matter to me. It doesn't matter to the country.GLENN: There's nobody there to pardon. There's nobody there to pardon.BILL: It doesn't matter. Joe thinks he's doing something noble.GLENN: No. I think Joe is trying to buy voters. And dupe voters.This is not his idea. Somebody came up and said this to him, so he can look like he's actually helping some people in prison, when it's not going to affect a soul in prison.GLENN: No. This is a younger voter play, the stoners. Out there, oh. I'll vote for Biden. He likes pot.   The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy people on the left. The AOC's have taken over, places in the media.And places like this in New York.This is what it is thousand. So there's been one case. One. One in the entire seven years. Where they did this.Where they shut down a company, that had no obvious victims.The case was 1972.And it was a company, relatively small company, that was writing term papers, for college students. Okay.So I want to write my paper.GLENN: I want to break out in God bless America.STU: Capitalism is pretty impressive. Apparently, this didn't go over that well.What they said, there were no obvious victims here. The people bought the term papers. They didn't want to write them. They got the term papers. They said, they were defrauding the education system.GLENN: Which they were.STU: This is the one time. And it's a small tiny company. Let me give you the other times they've done this.Tell me if any of these sound like, hey, I have a good interest rate, on a loan I paid back.Number one, a breast cancer nonprofit was shut down a do",,-6,-6
BECKNews_88," The U.S. Supreme Court is preparing to hear arguments in a new First Amendment case involving a Christian graphic artist who does not want to be forced to design wedding websites for same-sex couples. This case  coming from Colorado  marks the second time in five years that SCOTUS will grapple with religious business owners vs. gay weddings. But the far-lefts goal in this case seems to be much more sinister than hoping the two sides can conduct business peacefully. Rather, Glenn predicts, this case is about forced compliance: Its about forcing everyone to do exactly what they say, when they say it, and [to] have you profess a belief that you dont have.     Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: So does the First Amendment even exist anymore? We have a White House telling us, no. Will we have the Supreme Court telling us no, as well?I want to play a couple of things that happened in the Supreme Court, and outside, concerning the court case now, that is involving this web designer, who says she cannot make a website, you know, with gay marriage announcements and everything else, because she's a Christian.Well, let's start here. This is the Colorado attorney general that is insisting on television here, that even if you have moral objections, you have to do the work.Listen to this, cut three.VOICE: You talk about -- it's the slippery slope argument. If this happens, what is the next argument to fall. There are 29 states, including Colorado, that have nondiscrimination laws. What is the impact? If the court sides with Smith, what is the impact for, you know, makeup artists, hair stylists? You know, people in this sort of -- considering themselves having expressive professions? What is the actual big implication here, if this case doesn't go your way as you see it?VOICE: Well, first off, we're going to have to figure out where to draw that line. If someone makes specialized lattes, do they have an expressive interest in saying, I'm sorry. I don't want to serve Mormons, because I don't believe in the Mormon religion? That set of hypotheticals could become reality if we lose this case.GLENN: Hmm.Now, hang on just a second. Isn't this what cancel culture is doing?Aren't these businesses that disagree with your political view, not a status as a human being. But your political view, aren't they canceling you?So aren't they already having the right to do it, you are just trying to take away the religious right?Because I don't want to cancel anyone. But I'm not going to work for MSNBC.You know they're never going to hire me. But I'm not going to go work for them. I don't do that. I don't want to do that.I don't want to say those things. If I worked at MSNBC, well, then I had made a choice to take that job.Because that's what they do. Do I have a right to get on MSNBC and do the exact opposite? Don't I have a -- a right to my own conscience, and what I deeply believe. Especially when it comes to faith.Now, listen to Ketanji Brown.She got a lot of heat on this. She was talking about It's a Wonderful Life from the stand yesterday.VOICE: Public business. I'm a photographer, my belief is that I'm doing it's a wonderful life scenes. That's what I'm offering. I want to do video depictions of It's a Wonderful Life. And knowing that movie very well, I want to be authentic, and so only white children and families can be customers for that particular product. Everybody else can -- I'll give to everybody else, I'll sell them anything they want, just not the It's a Wonderful Life depictions. I'm expressing something, right? For your purposes, that's speech.GLENN: Okay. Ketanji Brown Jackson, sit down. You're a moron. You're a moron. First of all, yes. I am making It's a Wonderful Life scenes. That is clearly a vision that we've seen. We can put the standard side by side.So if I'm creating that scene, yeah. I can discriminate and say, no. I need white people in this. Because I'm re-creating that scene.Now, if I'm updating that scene, if I'm showing It's a Wonderful Life in today's America, well, then, I could include and should include everyone. I don't even know what she's talking about here. First of all, It's a Wonderful Life is not a religious objection. If I have a religious objection, I can't change what I believe, just like you can't change your skin color. I cannot change a deeply held religious belief.STU: But in -- it's true, first of all. But it's also, an additional thing. Right?Like, the religious part of this gives you additional protection, beyond what is already there. You can't compel someone to say something.That is like really a bright line in our country. You can't -- take it to this example.If -- if -- if Kanye West opened up -- decided to open up a website that said, hey, I will customize birthday songs for you.Which, by the way, given his career arc, may be a real possibility very, very soon. GLENN: He's working on the pancake recipe now.STU: Right. And let's just say, hey, I will customize your Happy Birthday rap, just give me your name. And then someone decides, hey, in fact, how about do my bar mitzvah instead? Does he have to do that?The answer to that is no. You can't ask -- despite his anti-Semitic views being abhorrent to most, you cannot force him to sing a positive song about a bar mitzvah because that would be compelling his artistic expression. You cannot do that.That's already there. Whether it's a religious belief or not. Just because he does --GLENN: And in his case, it is both. In his case, it is both.STU: You can argue, I guess the black Israelite -- maybe that's where it is. Even if it's just not about religion at all, you still can't make somebody do that. Add on to that, the religious protection. It's a whole 'nother layer. I mean, really a lot of this case has been less about religion and more about the idea whether you can compel speech. There was a famous case that happened recently, where it was a religious institution. I can't remember which one it was. But was saying, hey, there's a new state law that says, if you're going to counsel people on pregnancy, you have to post a poster that says, abortion is an option and here's how you can get one if you want to. And the Supreme Court said, no. You can't a religious organization, who doesn't believe in abortion, to post that. You can't compel them to speech. And that speech was defined as posting a poster.This has been a bright line forever!And hopefully, this Supreme Court will actually have the balls to cast a very broad net here, to make sure this is protected for everyone.You should never be forced to say or express something you don't believe.GLENN: So here's what Barrett said, yesterday. She said, Canada's designer declined to serve a Catholic club because they disagreed with their views on marriage.The -- the -- the Colorado attorney respond, yes.Because that's not status-based discrimination.Wait. Hang on just a second. She went in and said, wait. But the designer can't decline to do a same-sex marriage design.Yes! Because same-sex marriage is inextricably intertwined with status. And religion isn't.Hold on just a second. Hold on just a second.There is a -- a whole right that was defined as a very bright line, as Stu just said. So it's not like we're looking and trying to read in, well, we've got to have freedom of speech. And does freedom of religion fall into that?No. Freedom of religion is entirely separate. Entirely separate. And so it is protected, clearly. There is no trouble so my comma in this one. It is clearly protected. But if you want to argue that you have the right for a designer, a web designer to discriminate against a Catholic church. Which they do have that right. I don't want to do your design. Great. I'm glad you told me, that you hate us, because I don't want you designing our website. I don't think you'll do a good job. If I can decline the church, why is it the church, that has a deeply held religious belief. I mean, my church was founded on the family. And the sacredness of men and women and gender. Gender is ordained by God, before birth. There is no confusion. That's like 40 years old in my church.Wait. I have to change now? No. Because I can't change because the government tells me I have to change. This is something I believe to the core. And I either believe it, or I don't. Now, you think that I can just change my belief, because you're right. No. No.I believe God has set these standards. Not man. Not you. Not me.I can't change the standards. Neither can you. And as long as I'm consistent in that, I have a right to assert my religious exemption, from your little rule.I'm sorry. I -- my faith tells me, I cannot go there.If you have a religious object injection to war, and you are a pacifist, and it's a religious exemption, you don't have to go fight in war.Because you're a Quaker. And it is a deeply held religious exemption.And it's a deeply held relief. Or belief.STU: That's a great example too. Like, we have come. Think of what that particular exemption is. We are saying, our country is under attack. Our nation may fall. It's the literal most important thing, that a government can do, right?GLENN: Without your nation. Without people fighting this war, we could fall to the Nazis, and you won't have your right to your religion. That's the argument against.STU: Right. And even with that scenario, we say to the Quakers, you know what, you don't have to do it. Your religion is more important than the war. Your religion is more important than the entire country falling or not.GLENN: Because we don't have the right.STU: Because we don't have the right.GLENN: To get between you and God.STU: And here we have an argument about lattes?GLENN: Yes.STU: We're acting as if wedding sites. Are they even a thing? I guess I got married too early. Wedding websites, we're acting as if that's as important?We've said the actual defense of our to Nazis is not important enough to overwhelm this right. And we're talking about lattes and photographers and cupcakes. This is completely ridiculous. And then you add on the free speech element of this. Which is what this case seems to be surrounding more than anything else.Whether the government can say you must say two plus two equals five.With this -- with the way they're describing this right, the government could tell anyone to say anything.GLENN: Yes.STU: And either one of these rights, is clearly defined. Either one of them overwhelms the left's case on this, and they have both of them working in conjunction here. This is not a close call.GLENN: This is a freedom-breaking decision.If they decide in favor of Colorado, this is a freedom-breaking -- you have no right anymore. You'll have no right.And this done in conjunction with what they just passed, the Defense of Marriage Act, or interracial act. This is what they're hoping for.This is what they're shooting for. To be able to shut down anyone that objects. It's not about living together and tolerating one another.It is about forcing everyone to do exactly what they say, when they say it. And have you accept and profess a belief you don't have.That's a dictatorship. That is Naziism. Communism.It -- it is a religion. We are headed towards a -- a theocratic autocracy.Their religion is just a Gaia. And Baal. And whatever it is that worships the earth in slaughter and perversion of children.   The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy people on the left. The AOC's have taken over, places in the media.And places like this in New York.This is what it is thousand. So there's been one case. One. One in the entire seven years. Where they did this.Where they shut down a company, that had no obvious victims.The case was 1972.And it was a company, relatively small company, that was writing term papers, for college students. Okay.So I want to write my paper.GLENN: I want to break out in God bless America.STU: Capitalism is pretty impressive. Apparently, this didn't go over that well.What they said, there were no obvious victims here. The people bought the term papers. They didn't want to write them. They got the term papers. They said, they were defrauding the education system.GLENN: Which they were.STU: This is the one time. And it's a small tiny company. Let me give you the other times they've done this.Tell me if any of these sound like, hey, I have a good interest rate, on a loan I paid back.Number one, a breast cancer nonprofit was shut down a do",,-5,-6

BECKNews_90," Peaceful, pro-life Americans continued to be targeted by the FBI. Many of them were arrested for praying inside or near abortion clinics, which the federal government says is a violation of the FACE Act. But, Glenn and Stu argue, this NEVER should have become an issue for the FBI or the federal government to begin with. In this clip, Glenn exposes the FBI's current 'agenda,' which could be coming directly from the White House. Plus, Glenn plays a related political ad from Eric Swalwell that's SO outrageous, he can't even watch the whole thing...    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Tonight, I mean, this is, so you know; I wrote the book what was it? It was the second, the Eye of Moloch, and it came out on a Tuesday, and either Monday or Wednesday was the day that Snowden came out and said the CIA was spying on you. Do you remember that?  STU: I don't remember that.  GLENN: Tonight I'm doing a special and I'm going to show you how there is a net or a noose that is being readied and it is well-coordinated, and it is closer than you think. Tonight I'm going to show you how churches, religion, religious institutions, are directly under attack, not just by this administration. Religion is being hit methodically from multiple different directions; the media, street activists, perversions within the church itself, as well as directly from this government and it's all happening right now. I'm going to show you how a group of house democrats are looking to weaponize the IRS directly at Christian leaders that have been staples of the American religion community for decades. Oh those IRS are just going after rich people, well, and pastors. At the same time, the left is creating their own religious networks and their own religious experts that let's just say have questionable opinions. I want to show you the opinion from the new president of the evangelical network, a group called Equal Justice USA, to sounds like the church I want to go to. His name is Sam Heath. Here he is recently on a podcast talking about, you know, people of trouble. Here it is. >> There may need to be a season of separation without harm for an individuals someone may need to be removed from a situation, a person, or from society, but the goal of that is ultimately to have that person reintegrated back into community. We already believe this as Christians; right? If we did church discipline in the right way, that's exactly what it is rn we approach someone, if that's rebuffed we approach as a group. We bring it before the church and that person is removed. Ex communication is never meant to be this permanent lasting puss punishment, it is meant to be this thing done for the safety of the community because harm is always communal, and it is a fact, and it is done with an invitation to return. It is done always with a handout of welcome, of return to this healings offered to you. If you can't pursue that in order to pro tech this community, we might need to remove someone for a season.   GLENN: For a season. I mean, that wouldn't be bad. Feel like summer camp.  STU: Right.  GLENN: Like summer camp.  STU: A camp.  GLENN: Okay. Now, let me just ask you, this is a guy who is let's just say, all he's talking about is abolishing all prisons, and the church is just like hey you know what, for a season, I gotta have you en a time out. But what is illegal right 93? What are we really talking about? Because I've heard, I've heard people on MSNBC right now talking about what are we going to do with these people that voted for Trump? What are we going to do with these people? First, if this was a Christian talking on a podcast about the sanctity of human life, they would have been labeled white Christian Nationalist. So we did some digging around because this guy, you know, he hasn't been labeled anything but good. So his group, Equal Justice USA, has received seven-figure fund from George Soros's open society. Religion is a left wing weapon now. It is under attack. Leftest agendas are being poured into doctrine, and at churches all over the country. You need to be aware of it, but you also need to be aware that the government is going to do whatever they can as well. Abuse of power is what the FBI is doing right now. They are using the FACe Act. Howmany times have you seen a swat team or an FBI guy kicking down the door of somebody's house? I is seen now more and it's on an Act I haven't ever even heard about. I mean when it was passed, I thought that was reasonable, don't block people they should be able to pray and say hey, please don't go in. But don't block somebody from entering. Okay. All right. Well, now the Biden administration has taken another political target, those who believe in the right for life. The guy who's involved on this one, 25 year old Herb Geraghty, with -- he was charged with a conspiracy against rights and FACE Act offenses. Wow, a conspiracy. Yes. Yes. It's a conspiracy. He's going to be on with me in just about an hour. He can't talk about some things. you know who this guy is? This is the guy who helped find, remember they found all of the fetuses, all the little babies in Washington D.C., and then it just kind of disappeared, that story? Remember?  STU: Loosely.  GLENN: You'll remember it en the next hour.  STU: Going to have to be more specific when you talk about one of these abortion clinics or situations that turned out really ugly.  GLENN: Yeah.  STU: Because there's been a lot of them.  GLENN: He's now facing 11 years in prison. He will tell you in a little while. He found out about it on Twitter. That, that they were coming for him. That's how he found out about it. He has since said I'm willing to turn myself in, but they're not, you know y don't have a word from them yet. I hope they don't bust down my door because I'm welcoming -- I have the feeling he kind of welcomes a trial. This is the world we're headed in if we don't stop the FBI. A whistleblower on the FBI just came out. He blew the whistle on the agency because they're not -- I'm quoting -- they're not following their own rules. The way they are using, quote, excessive tactics ensures that the process is the punishment, even if the suspect is innocent. That's what's happening. You think that 86 year old woman is going to prison? I don't think so.  STU: No. But the process is the punishment in and of itself. I think to make a quick distinction, Glenn, you mentioned the FACE Act being rational as far as we don't want to block people from going into clinics. You shouldn't be able to do that. It is rare irrational in the United States, however, for that to be a federal crime. There's no reason that comes from the federal government.  GLENN: No reason.  STU: Local, states, communities.  GLENN: These things are always local.  STU: That's how you  GLENN: Always local. The problem is the local police are not doing it. They're not arresting -- because they'll arrest them, charge them with a misdemeanor, and they'll say look, guys, you can't do that. They'll arrest them with a misdemeanor. And that's it. This particular Act happened two and a half years ago and the FBI is just on it now.  STU: Right. And that the problem. When you say the problem is that they're not, local police aren't doing enough they're just charging them with a misdemeanor. That not a problem. That's how it should occur. That's correct.  GLENN: Correct.  STU: What's going on now is they found this rule and they're utilizing it as a weapon to go after people they don't like.  GLENN: Exactly right.  STU: And we're seeing it over and over again across the country. This is why, even a sensible law, should not be in the hands of the federal government. This is why you keep it close to him in your local community. There is no reason why a federal law needs to be because people in Pocatello, Idaho are being blocked walking into a clinic. That's an Idaho situation, not a Washington D.C. situation.  GLENN: I was leading something the other day unrelated to this and it said and it is true on page 23897, 23,897 of the federal code, it states, and where thought -- oh. Oh, it's just that easy, it's right there.  STU: Why didn't we know?  GLENN: Now here's the craziest part of this thing. We are living in a time we are living in a time that has been lived in before where the two sides don't see the same thing at all. We're not seeing the same thing at all. We're seeing FBI come in and bust down the doors of people who were praying, praying. Bust their doors down, and then everybody else who steals, kills people, they're just released, it's no big deal. Now we're also seeing this happen because people were praying at abortion clinics. Here is a new ad from Swalwell.  STU: Eric Swalwell, the congressman?  GLENN: Yeah. It's a new campaign ad. I'm going to describe it. It's a couple having dinner in their house with their children. They're having dinner and all of a sudden you see the blue and red lights through their window. Listen.  >> You're weird.  >> He is weird, but cute.  GLENN: Aw, look at this.  >> Grows. (knock on door) > > Mary Anderson?  >> Yes.  >> I have a warrant for your arrest.  >> Arrest for what?  >> Penal code 243 violation, unlawful termination of a pregnancy.  >> You gotta be kidding me.  >> That's my personal business.  >> That's for the courts to decide, ma'am. Your medical records have been subpoenaed and Dr. Landry is already in custody.  GLENN: This is unbelievable June can't just --  >> You will have to submit to a physical examination.  >> What? By who? >> Don't touch her. My wife -- (baby crying).  GLENN: This is -- >> Put your hands behind your back.  GLENN: Okay. Stop. I can't watch anymore. You know why this is crazy is, first of all, it's local police.  STU: Yeah.  GLENN: It's local police, and they're not knocking, they're pounding open up, FBI. STU: Light.  GLENN: And if you don't open, they will come in. But they come in with rifles pointed at people. 87 year old ladies.  STU: This is really happening against the pro-life movement. It is not happening agents women who have had abortions. By the way, none of the laws passed  GLENN: Would allow that.  STU: Would let a woman being prosecuted.  GLENN: I would stand against it. We have got to heal hearts not throw people in prison. On this, now doctors are maybe a different thing.  STU: That where the law usually hits, is it's illegal to do it and the 'S the one that gets punished not the woman. I honestly don't think there's one law in the entire country that does that.  GLENN: No. Would you stand against it?  STU: Regardless. I mean, well, I don't think that the certainly the right approach for today. GLENN: Correct.  STU: At some point, it would be interesting if we actually do believe that this is taking a life, that the person  GLENN: No, I know that. That is not where are.  STU: Exactly.  GLENN: We're not there.  STU: The point here is that this is a mythical thing. You know what it reminded me of, Glenn? Cory Gardner banned birth control.  GLENN: Oh I know.  STU: Remember that whole thing where Cory Gardner the former senator from Colorado, they tried to beat him initially and they ran these ads where he was going to delete birth control from availability. It's like, well, you know; that's not at all, that's not at all what happened, the guy's already left office. They're still warning people that birth control is going to go away just around the corner. It never happens. They never have to honor this fan fiction they put out there in election season.  GLENN: Correct. So now the FBI is moving at gun point, not like, not like I almost said Cory Gardner, not like Eric Swawell is saying, the exact opposite of that. There are cases now that are at least two years old, no violence, and the FBI is trying to put these people in jail for eleven years. May I ask, where is the FBI with Jane's revenge? Where is the FBI in the over 170 attacks on Catholic targets since May of 2020. Where are you on that one, FBI? There is an agenda, and I will show you it to you tonight at 9:00 p.m., you don't want to miss it.  The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy people on the left. The AOC's have taken over, places in the media.And places like this in New York.This is what it is thousand. So there's been one case. One. One in the entire seven years. Where they did this.Where they shut down a company, that had no obvious victims.The case was 1972.And it was a company, relatively small company, that was writing term papers, for college students. Okay.So I want to write my paper.GLENN: I want to break out in God bless America.STU: Capitalism is pretty impressive. Apparently, this didn't go over that well.What they said, there were no obvious victims here. The people bought the term papers. They didn't want to write them. They got the term papers. They said, they were defrauding the education system.GLENN: Which they were.STU: This is the one time. And it's a small tiny company. Let me give you the other times they've done this.Tell me if any of these sound like, hey, I have a good interest rate, on a loan I paid back.Number one, a breast cancer nonprofit was shut down a do",,-3,-3

BECKNews_92," The FBI recently sent more than a dozen armed agents to the home of well-known pro-life activist Mark Houck to arrest him for allegedly violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances or FACE Act. Now the father of seven faces up to 11 years in prison over claims that he blocked a man from entering an abortion clinic and shoved him when he wouldn't stop verbally harassing Mark's 12-year-old son. Now, if that doesn't sound insane enough, this all happened after local authorities dropped the case. So, what's the full story here?  Attorney Peter Breen joined Glenn Beck on the radio program Tuesday to tell the family's side of the story, including how the case was already ""won"" three years ago, and how, after receiving a target letter from the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Mark's legal team agreed to cooperate fully, only to hear nothing back until the day the FBI showed up on Mark's doorstep.  Breen also explained how the FBI has tried to downplay ""abuse of power"" claims, accusing Mark's wife of making ""inaccurate claims"" about the terrifying experience. ""Ryan-Marie, who is Mark's wife, she thought she saw 25 [FBI agents.] The FBI came back and said it wasn't 25, it was no more than 15 or 20 heavily armed federal agents. And she had called them a 'SWAT team' because she's a lay person. I don't know the difference between a SWAT team and a bunch of heavily armed, armored, and shield-bearing federal agents,"" Breen said.   According to Fox News, a senior FBI source said: ""So, yeah, they had guns drawn and pointed at Mark in front of his wife and their children. And that whole show of force was done against a man who was not a drug lord, not a mafia boss, but instead, a law-abiding pillar of the community whose attorney said, 'we'll bring him in if you decide to charge, even though you have no case.'"" Breen went on to assert that he believes Congress ""needs to"" hold Attorney General Merrick Garland accountable for the arrest. ""I can't imagine that those 20 federal agents were excited about being called out to a peaceful man's home, guns drawn,"" he said. In the video clip below, Breen goes on the explain what he believes should happen next, and why Houck's arrest ""should frighten all of us."" Can't watch? Download the podcast here.

WRITER  Texas is under threat of a George Soros-backed takeover. Soros-funded RINO judges have been elected in some of the highest courts in Texas. These judges implemented restrictions that have blocked nearly a thousand cases of vot""fraud from being investigated or prosecuted from across the state. These new restrictions are similar to ones in place in states like George, Arizona, and Wisconsin, leaving Texas more susceptible to election corruption than ever. If Texas falls to corruption, America will lose its largest bastion of conservative electoral power in the nation. Without Texas, Republicans WILL NOT be able to win national elections and liberal corruption will go unchecked across the country.  Fortunately, there is a way to stop this: YOU. If you live in Texas you have a chance to stand up against corruption and to fight back! Starting Tuesday, February 20th, early voting for the primaries begins, where three of these judges are up for election. Go out and vote. If the right people are voted in, there's a good chance the restrictions will be lifted and election fraud can once again be prosecuted.  But remember, you can't just go in and vote for anyone who has an ""R"" next to their name. Sorors knows that a registered Democrat would never stand a chance in Texas, so his lackeys register as Republicans and ride the little ""R"" right into office. So who do you vote for?  Fortunately, Glenn had Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on his show today and Ken gave us his list of judges that he vouches for. His list is as follows:    WRITER  Who is really banning books? For years now, Conservatives have been taking flak from the left for supposed ""book bans."" The left likes to compare these ""bans"" to Nazi book burnings, accusing the right of sweeping authoritarian decrees designed to suppress information. In reality, this is a movement largely motivated by parents, who want to remove inappropriate books from children's libraries.  But if you want to discuss authoritarian book bans, look no further than the White House. As Glenn recently covered, the Biden administration has been pressuring the world's largest bookseller, Amazon, into suppressing books they disagree with. On February 5th, 2024, Ohio Representative Jim Jordan released a slew of subpoenaed documents that exposed pressure placed on Amazon by the Biden Administration. The documents, which Jordan dubbed ""The Amazon Files"" after Elon Musk's ""The Twitter Files,"" revealed an email conversation between Andrew Slavitt, a former White House senior adviser, and Amazon employees. In these emails, Slavitt complained that the top search results for books on ""vaccines"" were ""concerning"" and then requested that Amazon intervene. Amazon initially refused, not out of some altruistic concern for the free exchange of information. They thought any action taken would be ""too visible"" and would further exasperate the ??Harry/Sally narrative,?? referring to the outrage that followed Amazon's removal of Ryan T. Anderson??s book When Harry Became Sally.  Despite this initial refusal, Amazon agreed to meet with the White House a few days later. The number one item on their agenda was""oving books from the website. An Amazon employee even admitted that the reason they even took this meeting was due to the pressure being placed on them by the Biden Administration.  What was the result of this meeting? Amazon caved. They began to implement ways of limiting the outreach of books that challenged the mainstream vaccine narrative and other books the White House might not like. The White House was caught red-handed pressuring the world's largest bookseller to restrict the sale of books they consider in opposition to their narrative, and they have the gall to accuse conservatives of information suppression. This is just ONE of many actions committed by the Biden Administration that are more characteristic of a dictator than a president. What can you do about it? Fortunately, you are not dependent on Amazon and its corrupted algorithm to help you find books.

WRITER   The left-wing media's most recent tirade is accusing Trump of being a dictator. But, as Glenn said, ""Everything they're accusing us of, they're doing."" Since day one, the Biden administration has overstepped the bounds placed on the executive branch set by the Constitution. In Glenn's most recent TV Special, he examined ten times Biden acted like a dictator, NOT a president. Here are 10 of Biden's Dictator Moves, and click HERE to get ALL of the research that went into this week's Glenn TV special:     WRITER   Every day it seems Glenn covers another story revealing how people across the world at all levels of power DESPISE the fact that YOU have rights, and they are actively trying to curtail them. Recently, there has been a string of attacks against the rights outlined in the First Amendment: the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, the freedom of assembly, and the freedom to petition. As a refresher, the First Amendment reads as follows: This is powerful stuff, there is a good reason the Founding Fathers made it the FIRST Amendment. It's also the reason why power-hungry elites are attacking it. These attacks are designed to control the way you think, speak, and believe, vote, what you read, and who holds your representatives responsible. The First Amendment is our strongest weapon against tyrants, and they know it. So what can you do about it? Hope that some wig in Washinton will eventually do something? We know how well that works. The best thing to do is to stay active, engage in the issues you care about, and exercise your rights.  So where to start? Here are a few things YOU can do to protect your First Amendment rights:                                Religion                                   The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is toyou guessed itpractice your faith. Become an active member in your place of worship, go to scripture studies, invite your friends to that late afternoon event, and walk the life. This can impact the way you spend money as well. Shop the businesses and brands that share your values, and don't shop at the ones that scorn them. Keeping the community alive and healthy is the best way to ensure that generations to come will be able to experience the freedom you enjoy.                              Speech                                   Much like religion, the best way to protect your freedom of speech is... to speak. Engage your friends and family in polite, civil conversation. Stand up for what you believe in, and make your case to your peers. Just remember to keep it friendly. No one ever won an argument by shouting down their opponent. The civil exchange of ideas is the cornerstone of our republic, and a dialogue where the participants are well-informed, considerate, compassionate, and open-minded can have permanent impacts on all involved.                              Press                                   Freedom of the Press seems a little tricky at first. Unless you work for the media, what are you supposed to do? Quit your job and go work for the local newspaper? The good news is that exercising this right is not nearly that difficult. In fact, you are currently doing it. The best thing you can do is to read from outlets that produce informative content. Want to know what Glenn consumes to stay informed every day?

Assembly                                    Anna Moneymaker / Staff | Getty ImagesFreedom of assembly is one of the more impactful yet underutilized freedoms in the First Amendment. Peaceably assembling and protesting with like-minded individuals can hugely influence politicians and policies while simultaneously creating community and fellowship between attendees. It's understandable why more people don't turn out. We're all busy people with busy schedules, and flying out to D.C. for the weekend seems like a daunting task to many. Thankfully, you don't have to go out all the way to D.C. to make a difference. Gather some like-minded people in your town and bring awareness to issues that impact your community. Big change starts locally, and exercising your freedom to assemble can be the catalyst to lasting impact.                               Petition                                   If you've been a long-time listener of Glenn, then you will have heard a few of his calls to action where he asks his audience to contact their representatives about a particular piece of policy. There is a good reason Glenn keeps on doing those: they work. Whether it's your local mayor or your senator, a call and an email go a long way. If you really want to make a change, convince your friends and family to reach out as well. The best way to flex your Freedom of Religion is to??you guessed it??practice your faith. Become an active member in your place of worship, go to scripture studies, invite your friends to that late afternoon event, and walk the life. This can impact the way you spend money as well.

BECKNews_93," Hobby Lobby CEO and Founder David Green recently joined Glenn in-studio to discuss his new book, Leadership Not By The Book. During their discussion, Green details to Glenn the direction book his family decided to follow while building their business. He explains why its the best way to run a business, and he dives into several, important leadership lessons hes learned along the way&    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN:So there's a new book out, it is called Leadership Not by the Book by David green and bill high from Hobby Lobby. Welcome, David, how are you sir? DAVID: Thank you. It's good to be here. GLENN: It's good to see you again. First of all, I did a special last night about how the FBI and the federal agencies and the media are weaponizing against Christians as individuals and as business. You were, your fine was how much? DAVID: Well, they were going to fine me $1.3 millions a day. GLENN: A day. DAVID: If I didn't follow their instructions. We got that number by the number of employees we had. It's like a thousand dollars a day per employee. That was a lot of money. 1.3 was what we were looking at.  GLENN: And all you had to do was just offer birth control or abortion; right? DAVID: They were for pills and prescriptions that we could not provide because we knew it was after the fact that we were taking life and we knew we just could not do that. We had to have that when we signed our next insurance policy and so this was what the government was asking us to.We knew we couldn't do it. As you said earlier there are some things you just can't do. You can't go against your conscious.They were asking us to go against our conscious. GLENN: You won that case. DAVID: We did win that case. GLENN: Thank God you won that case. DAVID: Right. GLENN: And that changed the course I think the first real big win for America as we have known it then past. DAVID: It sure helped us. GLENN: It did. DAVID: We didn't know what we were going to do. People would ask me, what are you going to do if you lose this case? I said I don't know what we are going to do, but I do know we're not going to pi for someone's abortive pill. That is what we had decided as a family. In fact we came together as a family. We call ourselves gen 1 and our kids gen 2 and we had all of them in a meeting do you see this any different gen 3, the younger people in our family, and all of us stood the ground and said we're not going to take life for the sake of making profit at Hobby Lobby stores. GLENN: Let's talk about, by the way I think what you went through and I'd love to hear your opinion on this, it almost seems like the good old days compared to what we're facing now. DAVID: Things have gone pretty much south on a daily basis here. I can't even imagine what the government's asking us to do and how they're coming against us if you want to be a Christian. So some how or another today we're seen as the haters and yet we have the greatest story in the world about Christ who died for us while we're yet sins. So we're not the haters. We're the ones that got the best and the ""reatest love story in the world. GLENN: I have to tell you. I've met so many Christians that will come up to me and say what are we going to do? And I'm like there there's only one thing left to do and it's what everybody dismisses but if we don't turn to God and ask him for forgiveness and help we're not going to survive. He's the only answer at this point. People are like yeah, yeah, yeah, but what are we going to really do? I'm like do you not believe? Do you not believe that the guy who rose from dead, harder trick than fixing our country is not -- people of faith, I'm not sure that a lot of them really truly have faith that when it comes down to it, yeah. Whatever happens it's in his hands. DAVID: Yeah, but I think there's something we have to do. I think you'll see us, our family, with a lot of other families coming on the program. You're going to see it at the Super Bowl, he gets us. We're wanting to say ""we"" being a lot of different people that he gets us. He understands all of us. He hates who, he loves who we hate so I think we have to let the public know and create a movement, really. GLENN: That a different movement. I agree with you on that. There's lot we have to do. But that's one of the most important movements I've heard, if that what the movement you're doing. He loves those who hate us. DAVID: Right. GLENN: We have to find a way to love -- it doesn't mean don't stand against it. DAVID: Right. GLENN: You've got to be firm and clear on your stance and I'm not moving but I can't hate them. DAVID: That's right. We have to present the only answer to this, and it's not politics. you've already said it's him, Jesus who died for us, loves us, and until we accept him and know him and his scriptures and his book that he's given us we can settle the problems we have. GLENN: So you have written a book leadership not by the book. You're the founder of Hobby Lobby which started out, I love the way you began. You started out making frames with your family in the garage. DAVID: Exact.My boys made seven cents a piece. Today we do 8 billion-dollars so we've come a long ways. GLENN: I think so, from seven cents. DAVID: Yeah. GLENN: You have 12 principles in here and I've highlight ad foo of them, but I want you to just kind of give the overview of the book. DAVID: Okay. I think people ask me why I write the book and I thing one of the greatest reasons I wrote it is for us to understand we don't own what we have not because I say so, but because the scriptures and the old testament as well as the new testament says that God owns everything. I think as we see what we have is owned by him we're nothing but servants. When I say nothing but, I would rather be to serve and to be, to take care of what God has given us. Wealth is a curse and how do you handle the curse. That is to be someone that takes what god has given us and know how to handle it. GLENN: I think we used to understand that concept a lot more. We were country that had great welt. We helped, we helped each other, wear always the first on the scene. And now, I mean, it's, that's kind of like government does that. We just have this, we're just not the same people. DAVID: The government's done too much and that why sometimes we've backed off where we should not have backed off. We want to make sure what we do with our profits really make as difference. GLENN: Let's go through some of the principles that I'd like to talk to you about.Build for the next 150 years, not just the next generation. I don't think there's people, I think there's lots of people that are just building for tomorrow, not even the next generation. This is more Chinese in your thinking, explain. DAVID: I think it's also thinking about what we're doing in our lifetime. What are we doing that doesn't matter a hundred years from now. If you get to thinking and drilling down on that you want your life to be something that eternal and not just temporal. That's what we're doing there. We're making sure that our children come along and serve the Lord and also have the same priorities you do. That is to have Hobby Lobby going on forever if possible and being ministry to those that are in need. GLENN: How do you go from a framing place to everything you sell with that? I think there's a lot of people, they separate I want to talk about family too because you talk about this separation. They separate God and their faith from their business. They'll come up with all kinds of excuses that, you know, I gotta do what I gotta do. We gotta do business. DAVID: Right. I don't know had you do it without trying to find the book. This book is called Leadership Not by the Book, but hopefully is by The Book. I really don't know how you do it without following The Book. Because it gives us so much -- our creator has given us a book that really will help us. GLENN: What are some of the business decisions that you had to make that, you know, on the surface were nuts that regular business people go now but you just had assurance, I know this is what He want me to do and it will work out?  DAVID: I think one of those things is how we treat our employees. I sense the Lord just gave me a; the holy spirit, you're in Changer of these people. I'm putting you in charge of these people. Now you're saying what does that look like? It looks like they need to go to church on Sunday you gotta close on Sunday. It looks like you gotta open 66 hours a week maybe your minimum wage at to be 18-dollars an hour. Maybe you ought to have 7 different chaplains to help the people in need that have different problems. I think it looks like that lin of these things by the way are biblical but it's also good for business. We are very, very profitable, we have no debt -- GLENN: People would say, because I know you write about it in the book, people say how can we get to, you know, 16-dollars an how and you're like we're getting up to 18.50 an hour, what are you talking about? And everybody will say, as I know, I've been around business my whole life, people will make the argument you can't overpay. You can't, you can't make your hourly wage that high because you won't be able to afford it. It will jack prices up. DAVID: When we first started we just tried to survive so you need to understand that. It was just surviving. As we tried to follow The Book, which there is what ebb other book do you want to guide your life by, there's only one book that of God, the rest of them are man, there's only one and he's given us a book, a direction book. When you follow it I can't tell you a better way to run a business than following the book and following things I think would be pleasing to our Lord. GLENN: Tell me how, faith is one thing, but talk to somebody who doesn't necessarily have the faith just about how the principle of paying your employees, doing all of the things that you do, how do they convince somebody who doesn't necessarily may have faith but not your kind of faith. DAVID: Yeah, my kind of faith believes that God's word is where we're going to be best in our life and everything we do. He's given us a direction. Our creator gave us a direction book. If you don't have faith, why doesn't it look good to take care of your people and they take care of yours if you don't have faith at all? How does that not look good? How is what we're being told in God's book, how does it look wrong? He seems to make common sense and that to care for people if you really want them to care for you. So people know by the way who Hobby Lobby is before they knock on the door for an application and because of that I think we get the very; very best people that are out there. People that have a work ethic, people that have integrity. I think that one of the secret sauces is just to have great, great people. GLENN: It is, it's weird too, as somebody who is a conservative and a religious person, that I was, I can't remember what city I was in but I think there was a Michael's and I didn't know there was a Hobby Lobby. We go into the Michael's, it was just not good. We were like we gotta find Hobby Lobby. It was like this little island respite like I know things are safe here. I know things are the people are going to be nice, nobody's judging, I don't have to have any kind of stupid societal rules. It's nice. It's nice. DAVID: You know who you are when you're in our stores. You hear beautiful Christian music, every department has something that glorifies our Lord. If you come in, in front of the store and there's Bibles and good Christian books. We have a miniature Christian bookstore in the front of out stores. GLENN: You are breaking every rule of business. DAVID: Right, right. GLENN: You know? DAVID: It's okay. GLENN: No. I know. If you were just a business person I think you would us a booking and in say you're going to be a nice niche store you'll never be Hobby Lobby. And it's just amazing. DAVID: Yeah. We're proud of what God has given us. By the way, I give the glory to a lot of great, great people. We have just a lot of great people. Our officers, by the way, average over 25 years. We have people that stay with us, they love it, they love it because they know they're doing something other than just doing something to make the owners rich because that's not what they're doing.  The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy people on the left. The AOC's have taken over, places in the media.And places like this in New York.This is what it is thousand. So there's been ",,-3,-3

BECKNews_96," Glenn has HAD ENOUGH with the morons currently making decisions throughout America today. In this clip, he reveals 6 recent examples of moronic decisions from the last week  from a Pentagon decision regarding healthcare to Georgetown students walking out of a speech  and he explains how they ALL relate.     Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I told you about the protesters that unleashed the bees on the sherriff., told you about the protesters that glued themselves to the floor and they were upset because Volkswagen wouldn't give them a bucket to poop and pee in. It sucks to be you. Let me give you , let me give you a couple of others and maybe, I don't know, maybe it's too soon. Maybe it's too soon. But Ethan cline said on his pod cast, they give it to anybody now, I guess, he said that --  STU: That is how podcasts work you can give them to anybody.  GLENN: I know. Ben Shapiro, I hope if there's another holocaust, Ben Shapiro gets gassed first.  STU: That's funny.  GLENN: That's funny.  STU: It's funny to say, to joke about Jews being gassed.  GLENN: It is, especially if you're Jewish. It is so great. He says I know I'm going to be gassed too if that happens but there would be some satisfaction if Ben Shapiro was first you're a moron. Let me give you another moron. Georgetown students walked out during a Mike Pence speech.   STU: No. No, now they script that intention when they first walked in; right?  GLENN: They thought he was a reasonable man, they were going to hear some political talk. They had no intention of leaving and screaming hate has no home here in the middle of the speech by the way, I hear people chant hate has no home here, I don't even look to the stage. Could be Adolf Hitler, but I don't even look to the stage because you have, you is so corrupted hate, bigotry, everything else, that's everything. He only had, he had my name in a Manila folder. That is, isn't Manila in the Philippines? Why is he oppressing people from Manila in their folders? I mean, shut up.  STU: When you do that, I at least assume you have no argument.  GLENN: Me too.  STU: I assume you're saying tat because you don't have a logical argument because that would be a much better approach.  GLENN: Another thing I want to talk to you about, New York City officials unveiled the living conditions at the new migrant facility. This is for single adult males. The illegal immigrant camp, remember, New York cannot afford this. They need a billion dollars to build this camp. Okay. Your tax dollars are going to help not jug the tent but big screen TVs, X Box gaming systems, a laundry service, 24 hour snack bar and culturally appropriate cuisine. I'm going to lose my mind. Going to lose my mind. By the way, good news, let me just calm down a little bit. You know Elizabeth Warren, remember her? Yeah. Is that right? Did I culturally appropriate --  STU: No, because you're more Native American than she is.  GLENN: I'm double. Anyway, so the appeals court have found that the consumers bureau funding, and that the thing that was her baby, totally unconstitutional. STU: I wish that meant something. It certainly doesn't seem to when it comes to the loan situation.  GLENN: The loan situation, they deemed that was okay.  STU: They just can't find standing to sue. They keep throwing these things out of court because they can't find anyone with standing or at least they have not proved --  GLENN: I have standing. You have standing. It's our money.  STU: They've said, they've ruled in court that justing because you're a taxpayer that does not mean you have standing.  GLENN: Bull crap.  STU: That's what they said.  GLENN: I know.  STU: I agree with you, it's bull crap.  GLENN: Also, you know, you say it doesn't have any meaning, New Jersey legislatures have now advanced a bill for guns. They are going to make sure that they are one at law in the spirit of the second amendment, protecting gun owners while also trampling everybody's rights to own a gun. It's a really, it's a cute, a really cute law. Where, you know, you have to be of good moral character. What's that mean? It's a requirement. You have to prove that you're of good moral character. Oh okay. And that going to be based on at least four character references, an in-person interview and statements made on social media along with any other information that licensing officials deem relevant.  STU: There's never been a moral post on social media, that's never occurred.  GLENN: And gee, I wonder if you ever said anything bad about BLM you're going to get that gun.  STU: Of course not.  GLENN: By the way, again, I think I have standing here, do you remember the good old days when they said not one penny of taxpayer dollars are going to go to fund abortions. Yeah. We decided to go the extra mile now. The pentagon is going to pay service members travel costs for abortions, too. So if you're on a base and you can't get your abortion, don't worry, the pentagon will pay for your flight out to California.  STU: What? Those are your military theres being spent?  GLENN: Military dollars. I'd rather pay for a 600-dollar toilet seat. Biden has also, you know, he's, I mean, he's such a compassionate guy. He has dropped English and U.S. history testing for mentally challenged immigrant. Okay. They have disability so great they can't learn basic English or pass a U.S. Civics test. Okay. Well, all right, but can we, can we define that a little bit? Are they with their parents? I don't want anybody coming in to be a U.S. citizen and you're coming in as a family, but is this border crossers that are just claiming that they have mental disability -- what is this? What is this? And why all of a sudden is there a, because I haven't heard the outcry for that bill. One more story, college enrollment is now nowhere near pre-pandemic levels. Down another 7% this year. That's fantastic.  STU: That system has to die eventually.  GLENN: It has to die.  STU: It's not to say you should not further your education.  GLENN: No.  STU: That system is junk.  GLENN: It's dead.  STU: It really is. >> RICHARD SHORTLE: It's not just junk, it's poison.  STU: It is. It's obviously the terrible things it does to your kids aside, just the idea that like hey, we live in a situation are basically every piece of information is free; right? You can go on the internet and find everything. Yet they're going to thank you 50, 60, 70,000-dollars a year to go to a college and then just to add insult to injury, Changer you two, three, 400-dollars per book that you need a book, really? In this -- really? 2 or 300-dollars per textbook to act, just to be able to go to the class to learn the things you can probably learn for free otherwise.  GLENN: And the text books are all bull crap because they're all written by professors that's why they cost 200-dollars per book because that's a way to kick back to the professor.  STU: Totally.  GLENN: That's all that is. I mean, it is a scam, and it is poison. But here's some good news, at least, at least we don't have a parliamentary system.  STU: Thank you.  GLENN: Yes.  STU: I can't take this. Look, I don't care what Great Britain doesn't own -- you can, you can do what you need to do, but I would say the same thing to a heroin user, it's time for an intervention we need to step in and help our friends in Britain. This system is completely ridiculous.  GLENN: Wait, wait, wait. I wanted to, I want to defend one part that I've always made fun of.  STU: Okay.  GLENN: Order, order.  STU: Yeah.  GLENN: And they're all yelling a each other all the time.  STU: That's fine.  GLENN: At least they're still debating on the floor.  STU: It's just a stand-up comedy show they all just have one-liners.  OBSERVER: I love it.  STU: It's entertaining to watch.  GLENN: It's fun to watch.  STU: Liz Truss comes into office off a weird sort of side scandal there was no reason to remove Boris Johnson but all the tabloids decided they wanted it so it just happens and then they put in Liz Truss, she propose his maniacal tax cuts. We went over the details of these weeks ago. She only lasted 44 days.  GLENN: But she is the first woman to only last 44 days.  STU: There you go. Very important.  GLENN: Yes.  STU: She was lowering middle class tax rates by 1%, 1%. This is already pre-planned, already going to happen, she moved up the date it was going to happen and her big crime apparently was lowering rates on the highest bracket from 45 to 40. Now she abandoned that almost immediately but that was in her initial proposal. Yeah, the markets went nuts, but the markets are going nuts all over the world. So she's out now after 44 days and now they're saying that Boris Johnson may just come back in. They just gave him a month and a half off to go to the Caribbean. You think I'm joking but he's literally currently in the Caribbean. That is, that where he is. He is now flying back to Great Britain so that he can apparently run again for the job he just lost six weeks ago. This is insanity. I know we are screwed up here. I got it. Likes our country does not operate at peak efficiency. But, like  GLENN: Is that how you describe it? Not operating at peak efficiency.  STU: Watching the res of the world, yeah, that's how I describe it because I don't think ehave this thing figured out here, but it's certainly a helluva lot better than what they're doing there and seemingly everywhere else.  GLENN: Order, order.  STU: Order. This is crazy, Glenn what is --  GLENN: I don't know. It's, the Israel is like that too.  STU: Israel, same thing. Every two days another election.  GLENN: I know.  STU: Stop it with this. Plan your elections in advance. Is that too much to ask? Put it on a calendar and --  GLENN: I like the fact, I like the fact that the prime minister has to be invited by the queen to form a government. Every time there's a prime minister election, the prime minister says I'm out and then they'll have their little, you know, insider election, and then queen has to invite and say I'd like you to form a government in my name. Oh, yes, your majesty.  STU: It is very weird.  GLENN: It's weird.  STU: Not to mention, whenever they get good polls like hey we're up by egg points in the polls, there's a new election next week. When you call for a new election week, that's really what happens. I get this is a, I'm speaking from a place in which half the country believes the election was stolen until the other side wins then the other half of the country thinks the election is stolen. I'm not saying we're doing a great job here. I'm just saying, at least we know when our elections occur. We know -  GLENN: Let me just throw in, let me just tell you, as you were ranting on this, and saying you know I know we have problems, I look up to the monitors in the room and they say, the under the president who's speaking live said three trillion dollars of debt is.  STU: responsible and the -- wait.  STU: What? This is your --  GLENN: Him coming out now and saying you can't elect the Republicans because they're going to deliver tax cut -- exactly what happened. Exactly what happened. In England, because they will have tax cuts -- STU: They are so desperate.  GLENN: Oh, my gosh.  STU: This is what they're doing.  GLENN: It's crazy.  STU: You know what? They saw saw that Liz Truss was taken down they're like let's try approach number 14.  GLENN: But this one has the same kind of ending the last one does. When the Republican, mark my words, when the Republicans get in, you will see a crack doing anything. Because the central banks are in on it. That's that why 1% crash things because the central bank said whoa, wait a minute, what's happening with the retirement funds, retirement funds started to crash, and it was all blamed on a 1% tax cut. Watch, it's going to happen and he'll blame the Republicans.  The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy peo",,-4,-5

BECKNews_98," Rep. Dan Crenshaw certainly has a ""very weird approach"" trying to convince his more conservative colleagues to vote for Kevin McCarthy as House Speaker, Glenn says. In fact, his divisive stance likely will only harm America more. Now is a time the Republican Party MUST unite on principles, and demeaning Freedom Caucus members (or worse, potentially choosing a Democrat Speaker of the House instead) will not help. In this clip, Glenn provides 6 reasons why we NEED principled Republicans leading the House of Representatives today. Because if GOP leadership continues to follow the status quo, not only will we NEVER receive vital answers about recent, political events, but some of the far-left's darkest players will continue to escape with their crimes...    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I don't know if you know this, but Dan Crenshaw slammed the 20-house Republicans that oppose Kevin McCarthy. He said, I'm tired of your stupid platitudes, that some consultant told you to say on the campaign trail. Behind closed doors, just tell us what you actually want, or shut the F up.Huh. So he thinks the people in the --STU: Weird approach.GLENN: Very weird approach. He thinks people in the Freedom Caucus are being told, this is what you have to say to win. Really?STU: Oh, yeah.GLENN: He said, they need to be men and adults, who say, what they want, instead of playing these little games. That's what we're asking. That's what I've asked them. Some of them are my friends. Stop saying platitudes like Washington is broken. That's not a platitude. That's the truth. We can't do the status quo. That, again, not a platitude. That's the truth. And I love how he says, behind closed doors, tell us what you really want. Is that what you do, Dan?He said, that they are now showing themselves to be unbelievably serious. They're now just choosing random people. They don't have a plan. They're acting like terrorists.Oh. Wow. Acting like terrorists.STU: Well, you remember the 9/11 attacks, were initially chosen because they -- well, it was really about voting. And they didn't have a plan on which candidate they wanted to come around. That's when Matamata had to do that.GLENN: Really? Is that what that was about? STU: If I remember correct. GLENN: And he was just saying, hey, we should operate under the constitutional norms?STU: That was the big demand from what I remember. They were very concerned about it. Okay. Look, it's a thing. I get it. It's a figure of speech.Still, it's still silly.GLENN: Yeah. I'm so tired of -- look, I am -- I am to a place. And maybe I'm wrong on this.I'm to a place, to where I am not -- I do not want to banish anyone to the outer regions. You believe in God?You believe in the Constitution?But we disagree on how to exactly -- exactly how to worship him. Or, you know, what church we go to. Or, you know, we don't agree on all of the policies.Do you believe in the God of Abram, Isaac, or Jacob? Yep. Okay.Do you believe in the Bill of Rights. Yep. Do you believe in the Constitution. That we are a constitutional republic.And that's the problem. We're not operating anymore under the Constitution and Bill of Rights. Yep.Good. I'm fine.STU: Yeah. You're asking for more than I am. I think I would take half agreement on one of those things. That's about what I would want at this point.GLENN: Yeah. Do you believe in the God of Isaac?What about Jacob?STU: No. I don't worry about Jacob. Jacob was off the reservation. We don't know.But it is kind of. It's a difficult thing, right?I understand trying to come up with someone who will please these 218. To get to 218 is not going to be easy, right? If you put up someone who is more conservative, likely one of the more annoying moderates is going to say no. And they will bail on it.GLENN: Sure. STU: You know, you're at the point now, where you start to wonder, whether Kevin McCarthy is going to start going to Democrats and say, hey. We only need 5 of you.GLENN: Oh, I think, I believe that they will go to Democrats. They -- I believe they would even go for Hakeem Jeffries over a Freedom Caucus person.STU: It's not completely out of the question. First of all, you have a very incompetent group of people, right? So it's highly possible a bunch of them forget to show up one day, and Jeffries just wins. I mean, because of the way this vote works, it's not out of the question.GLENN: Well, no. You have to have 218.STU: You have to have the majority of the people voting. So if you vote present or you don't show up to vote, that threshold lowers. He's getting 212. Jeffries is getting 212 each time. I don't think that's out of the question. I don't think it's out of the question, that they try to pull some stunt. One of the things they're talking about doing, is changing the rules.GLENN: Oh, that's always good. Always good. I loved that. It worked out well in 2020. Didn't it? For the Democrats. Worked out well. Just changed the rules.STU: If you changed the rules. Normally, you would have the majority of people voting. They can change the rules, to say, actually, now it's a plurality. Now in their mind, what would happen, McCarthy would win 216. No. Basically, the idea there would be to put a gun to the head of the Freedom Caucus and say, it's going to be either McCarthy or Jeffries.GLENN: I would not doubt for one second, for one second, that they do that.STU: And what happens?GLENN: They like the Democrats, and would rather deal with the Democrats than anyone who believes in the Constitution.STU: And there is a bubbling theory in Washington, in these circles. That, you know what, we'll not be able to get anything done anyway. We're not going to get anything passed. Because everything we pass is going to go to the Senate and die.GLENN: If they do this.STU: Why not just let Jeffries have it?GLENN: If they do this, the Republican Party should be over.STU: This is really being talked about in Washington. Where they're saying, look, let Jeffries win this thing. We still will be able to vote on the bills he brings up. We'll shoot him all down. We'll still block everything. And then they'll get all the blame. Because they'll still have the control, and 2024, we can come in and win. I'm telling you, this is actually bubbling around.GLENN: Wow, so that is -- let me just see if I have this strategy. At least we're not the Democrats 2.0.STU: Yeah.GLENN: That's all that is. And it was such a winning strategy last time.STU: Yeah, they want to run it back, this time.GLENN: I have to tell you, there is -- this is so important.First of all, Dan Crenshaw, you want to call people like me a terrorist. That's fine. I'm not going to return the charge to you.I deeply disagree with you on many things.But I'm not going to call you names.Because we all have to come together.If we are going to stop the evil that we are all fighting against.We not only need the people we agree with. We need the people we disagree with as well.The left -- evil has found out a way to cobble together a huge coalition. They've convinced themselves. The Marxists have convinced themselves, yeah, well, the statists. We'll get rid of all the big business people when we get in charge, and the big businesspeople are like, we'll get rid of all the Marxists when we're in charge.They're going to eat each other. They're going to eat each other. But first, they will feast on us. So what do you say, we come together? And we look for principles.What the Freedom Caucus is standing for, are principles.I don't know -- I don't need a consultant. And, in fact, I think any -- any politician that is hiring these consultants.I -- I think you're an idiot.I think you're an idiot, the consultants are the ones who got us here.The consultants -- you know, who is actually feeling what's going on? Because it's really clear what's going on.Why do we need the Republicans to be strong, have a spine, and not be part of the swamp?Let me just give you a couple of things.Let's see. SCOTUS. Remember somebody leaked the -- leaked the abortion bill early?And the verdict, they were like, yeah.STU: I do remember that.GLENN: It's been eight months, nothing.That's not true. People in the Supreme Court know who leaked it. I can guarantee it. I can guarantee it.They know who leaked it.They won't say. Because John Roberts thinks it will damage the court, and the justices.Well, you're doing more damage there. And, you know what, if you're not willing to find out, who put people's lives in danger, well, then, we need an agency, that will.We need a group of people who say, this was wrong. And cannot be tolerated. Because it is a terroristic act.STU: Do you want to give us who -- who -- who leaked it --GLENN: No. I might. I might.Not today. But I might.We have General Milley. We now know he hid the nuclear codes from Donald Trump.And talked to Nancy Pelosi, and said, don't worry, I've made two phone calls. To the Chinese. I told him, if he tries to do anything. And I got the nuclear codes. He's not going to be able to do it.What do you -- is that even true? And then he goes on, a couple of months later, and he's responsible for Afghanistan. And the guy hasn't been asked a single question about it.That doesn't seem right. How about this?The ex-capital police boss says that he wasn't informed on all of the Intel that was being given to Nancy Pelosi.He said, we didn't get it. You think I'm the head of the capital police. But the head of the capital police, is actually a bunch of politicians. And for some reason, they didn't tell me. And when I finally heard about some threats, not the amount of threats, that they -- we now know knew, he said, I think we need to have a national guard. And they said, we don't like the optics of that.I don't know. I think we should probably get down to what really happened on January 6th, with this speaker's office.By the way, the FBI has raised the reward for that darn pipe bomber. That was just so coincidentalThe way that happened. It was amazing. And they have him on tape and everything. But they just can't find him.So they just said, we're going to raise it up at half a million dollar reward, if you can find this guy.How about this one? Hunter Biden. Can we just find out?Can we just find out, who in the FBI was protecting? Who in the FBI was going in, trying to silence people, who was it?You know, because he's still doing it. Hunter Biden. The child support now. You know, with his hooker mama or whatever. She's like, he's got money. And he's crying poor mouth to the judge. I want to see the records of the art.They're selling for $500,000 a piece. Well, shouldn't his -- I don't know, son or daughter, you know, have some child support from this guy. Absolutely.STU: Yeah.GLENN: Absolutely.STU: Incredible that they're not even going after him for that.GLENN: Yeah. Well, you know, there's another thing that really is interesting.The ethics watchdog protect the public's trust, is now calling for an investigation of Biden officials in the connection to Sam Bankman-Fried.Apparently, there were some slack channels, between him and the White House.And as this thing started to fall apart, one of the guys, who has now been arrested, pulled all of the slack channels, and they're trying to make sure, that the White House didn't delete and erase all of that. Which they most likely did.What was going on?This guy stole millions of dollars to people, and then gave it to the Democratic Party.I don't know. Maybe we should find out a little bit about that. How about the border?Do you think maybe we should have a Congress, that is just actually doing something about the border?Or should they do a study on it. And talk about it.And say, next time, when we have the power, we're going to do something. But comprehensively.How about -- how about getting some people who don't agree we should go to war, with Russia?We are now close to sending armored weaponry to the Ukraine.Can we get Congress to give us answers?Is the CIA actually providing targets in Russia, that has been reported?Is that true? Can we get somebody on that?People are leaving. They're leaving New York, California. For Texas. And Florida.In record numbers. Why? I'm going to give you the plan, that the G.O.P. should use, to win.These are the reasons why the Freedom Caucus is standing up and saying, enough is enough.And I believe the G.O.P. anybody who votes for a Republican, I'm not a Republican. But I generally vote for Republicans.I'm done. I'm done.If they can't do anything, I'm done.Why would I fight for them a second longer?   The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy people on the left. The AOC's have taken over, places in the media.And places like this in New York.This is what it is thousand. So there's been one case. One. One in the entire seven years. Where they did this.Where they shut down a company, that had no obvious victims.The case was 1972.And it was a company, relatively small company, that was writing term papers, for college students.

BECKNews_99," Do you want to live in a country thats codifying hatred? Thats what this election is about, Glenn says, because our country is becoming more divided by the second. In this clip, Glenn shares several stories  from a political debate gone wrong to recent comments made by Hillary Clinton  that show how much danger currently faces our republic...    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN:So do you want to live in a country, because this is what this election is all about. Do you want to live in a country, where we're furthering the hatred of one another? And we're codifying it?We're making it part of our law. It's part of the mantra. You know, people didn't like Donald Trump, because they said he was going to cause violence. Violence is already happening. You may not know it, if you just listened or watched the mainstream media. But it's already happening. You can look at what happened over -- over last week. 18-year-old kid, run over by a car. Because the guy say maniac. Most likely an alcoholic. They were having a political argument. He gets into the car. He leaves. All in a handcuff. He sees the boy. Calls somebody. He immediately thinks, he's a Republican extremist. And he's calling to get his extremist friends to come kill me. So he runs him over. And then calls the police himself. He leaves the scene of the crime, and he calls the police himself.And says, I just -- I just hit, and possibly killed an extremist Republican. Is this the kind of country you want to live in?There was an 83-year-old woman, going door-to-door, passing out pamphlets. And talking about proposition three in Michigan. Which seeks to enshrine abortion rights in the state's Constitution. She was shot. Eighty-three years old. She was in a conversation, I guess a heated conversation at a residence in her neighborhood. The man who shot her was not involved in the conversation. The victim doesn't know his identity or motive, but she had to drive herself to the hospital.She had to drive herself -- she's an 83-year-old woman. She leaves your door. Somebody in your neighborhood shoots her. And there's no one to take her to the hospital.She has to take herself? Is this -- I don't care who that is. I don't care who comes to your door. You don't shoot people. Let alone an 83-year-old woman. Is this the America you want?Hillary Clinton, this weekend, compared Trump supporters to Nazis. If we didn't have such a bad school system, there's a reason why they've buried the Nazis. They buried them, in education. Because we brought a lot of Nazis over here, after the war, we brought all the top scientists over. Oh, well, we -- we're afraid of Nazis. But not that afraid of Nazis. And they made Nazis into the big bogeyman, because the left prefers communism.But it's the same thing. Except, one is a public/private partnership, which is exactly what the World Economic Forum and Joe Biden are pushing for. When they say democracy, democracy is at stake. They mean democracy.They don't mean the republic. They want one man, one vote. And that's the way fascism always starts. You can vote. And they'll vote in who they want, and then there's no more vote. That's why we have a republic. I wish people -- I pray that people will wake up. I pray that people will do their own homework. People are rediscovering the Constitution and the Declaration. And that's a really good thing.Rediscover your faith to really know what's true. You really have to start at the beginning. And if you don't have a faith, I urge you to find one. But if it's just not for you, okay. What were the things that your parents or your grandparents taught you, that you know to be true?Just behave that way. Just the things that we all used to know were true. Do that. The next right thing.   The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy people on the left. The AOC's have taken over, places in the media.And places like this in New York.This is what it is thousand. So there's been one case. One. One in the entire seven years. Where they did this.Where they shut down a company, that had no obvious victims.The case was 1972.And it was a company, relatively small company, that was writing term papers, for college students. Okay.So I want to write my paper.GLENN: I want to break out in God bless America.STU: Capitalism is pretty impressive. Apparently, this didn't go over that well.What they said, there were no obvious victims here. The people bought the term papers. They didn't want to write them. They got the term papers. They said, they were defrauding the education system.GLENN: Which they were.STU: This is the one time. And it's a small tiny company. Let me give you the other times they've done this.Tell me if any of these sound like, hey, I have a good interest rate, on a loan I paid back.Number one, a breast cancer nonprofit was shut down a dozen years ago. For using nearly all its $9 million in donations to pay for director's salaries, perks, and other expenses, instead of funding free mammograms. Okay.So they told everyone, donate money for free. Mammograms. And they just took all the money for themselves.That's number one. Number two, a private equity timber.Faking big investment success, was closed down after stealing millions of dollars from thousands of investors.Okay?You can see.GLENN: Yeah. Got it. But on both of those so far, you have hundreds of thousands of people, you know, I'm sure. That gave -- they're all victims.They gave their money.STU: Yeah. And they didn't get the thing that they want.GLENN: They didn't get the thing they were promised. You have all these people going to the AG. Saying, hey, this is a real problem here. This has to stop. Not here.GLENN: Not here.STU: Another one. Mental health facility, shuttered for looting $4 million from public funds, while neglecting patients.GLENN: Okay. Kind of a big one.STU: Pretty clear. An auto lender that allegedly charged hidden interest rates, got to stay in business last year if it paid a fine and didn't commit fraud in the future.So here's one they didn't shut down.They actually let them go on.They're going after Trump in all of this. In this one, they're like, oh. Sure, they're hidden fees.They're not telling you about them.GLENN: Okay.STU: A judge requested.A judge refused to request to shut down a river rafting company in 2011.After a customer drowned, and the attorney general showed it was repeatedly using unlicensed guides, or none at all.Instead, he ordered only a 50,000-dollar bond and cleanup -- for him to clean up his act.The company is still being run today, under a different name by the same family. Someone died.GLENN: We have thousands of victims.And in this case, somebody who is dead.STU: Is dead!GLENN: Dead!STU: They're like, you guys can stay open -- and then this one is my favorite one. A judge in 2001.Declined to appoint a receiver, to take over a porn site, despite millions of dollars of illegal credit card charges to hundreds of customers.Who thought they were getting a free tour.Now, look, you're -- you want to get the free -- you want to know what you're subscribing for, Glenn. Before you just pulled the trigger on that. So you put your credit card information into a porn site, I think some of these victims need some life changes to be made here.But they put their credit card into a porn site. Expecting a free tour.They instead, get charged and charged and charged and charged.In fact, once the owners of the site were caught, they attempted to move their money overseas, to avoid any penalty.Still, the judge said, appointing a receiver was an extraordinary remedy!That should be used sparingly, and that a preliminary injunction was good enough.Only after all that happened, it they find out, the people running the porn site, were the Gambino crime family.(laughter)I kid you not. The Gambino crime family.GLENN: And they didn't go into receivership.STU: So there you go. Think about that.I mean, it's so obvious, what they're doing. Latitia james talked about it when she ran.Her goal was to take this one individual out.And the New York -- the voters of New York, said, good.Go do it.And now she's doing it.GLENN: Okay. If you are -- if you have business in in New York, if you're in New York, I'm just telling you. You have to do what you have to do.There's no way, I would keep my business in New York.There is no rule of law now. You know it on the streets. But there is no rule of law. If they can get away with this. They can do anything to you.   Elon Musk has announced that the first Neuralink patient can now control a computer mouse by just thinking. But while this technology could help a lot of people, should we proceed with caution? Between AI and this new merger of man and machine, Glenn gives a warning about what the future could hold. Glenn and Stu also review the controversy surrounding Googles Gemini AI, which refused to generate images of white people.     Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: So the website, Down Detector, detected a surge in outage reports from users at AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Customer Cellular, Boost Mobile, US Cellular, and Straight Talk.That the reports of the system being downed or outages, began at 3:45 a.m. Eastern time. The outages have been reported across many major US cities.It looks like, that it is back up. I'm not sure.They say, they don't think this was a cyber attack.But how did all of them go down at the same time?I mean, that's kind of weird.Yesterday, Israel had a cyber attack.It was from Iran. The Israelis say. And it was an attack on their cell phone services.So quite a coincidence. But let's not jump to any conclusions. Let's see what actually happened.Cyber attacks are going to happen. At some point, soon. We will have cyber attacks. And it will leave you vulnerable, if that's what you depend on.We are becoming more and more, a society that is connected in all things, and absolutely incapable of doing any things, without our electronics.We hit a milestone yesterday. This is truly like landing a man on the moon, I think. This is -- this is the first real merging of man and machine, I think. I mean, we've had the electronic. You know, the bionic arms and things like that.But this is in your mind.It's Neuralink. Elon Musk came up with it. And it is really tempting, because this is -- you know, this will be great to some degree. You'll be able to access information, and have the old internet in your head. You want to speak French?Okay. Download it. Got it.I mean, it is really -- isn't that the Matrix?STU: Yeah. The Matrix too. We're turning into The Matrix. That's the theme of the show today. GLENN: So that is now the beginnings of that, happened and was announced yesterday. Elon Musk said, Neuralink is active in the first person, to have one of the chips implanted in their brain. They have seemingly made a full recovery.We -- you know, so far. We don't know what the effects of this are, or will be. But Musk said, the patient can now move the mouse around a screen, just by thinking.So he has Bluetoothed himself to the screen.Crazy. Huh.STU: It's incredible that they can do that. And, you know, also, look at the way Elon Musk does business.This is a lot of what he does. Which is a lot of kind of just -- let's try it. There's a lot of -- hey, let's give it a whirl.GLENN: He said I think yesterday or earlier this week, that he had plans by 2029, to have a million people on Mars.And when I heard that, I thought, there's no -- oh, it's Elon Musk. Maybe.STU: Well, yeah. And this is his goal, with all of this stuff. He has -- I think it's a T-shirt or something. He wears. Like occupy",,-4,-5
BECKNews_100," Mark Houck, pro-life author and father of seven, was arrested in Philadelphia last year for allegedly shoving a pro-choice protester away from his young son. The charges were dropped, which makes his recent arrest story that much more terrifying. In this clip, Glenn details the shocking way Houck recently was taken into custody by the FBI for supposed FACE Act violations. But whether or not you agree with Houcks pro-life stance, Glenn explains, this story has HUGE implications for every single American: Is this the America you want? Glenn asks. Because once YOU get out of line, youll be the one finishing the poem: When they came for me, there was no one left.      Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN:  Mark Hock, along with Ryan Marie Hock. Seven children. Mark's a well-known pro-life author, sidewalk counselor, father of seven. And thank goodness the S.W.A.T. team came into his house. Yes. Yes. Came into his house. Broke the door down.Scared the hell out of the family, and he is in jail today!Apparently, he violated the Face Act. Now, I wanted to understand exactly what the face act is. So I looked it up. Let me see if I can find it here. Face act. No. It was moved.That's helpful. So the Face Act, basically what the Face Act is. I don't know where it was moved to. But basically the Face Act is something that the local governments and even the federal government, can bring up charges on, if you are trying to block somebody from going into an abortion clinic.STU: Freedom of access to clinic entrances.GLENN: Okay. Thank you. Thank you.Freedom, yeah. What is -- can we stop naming them stupid names?STU: Are we so dumb, that we need to summarize --GLENN: We are. Okay. So you can't block somebody from having access. Well, he didn't block anybody from having access. There was another street performer, somebody else who was screaming at the other side.And he and his son were there, and they were praying. And this activist, who was not going into the Planned Parenthood.Wasn't escorting anybody. He starts screaming at mark and his son. And not sure exactly, what happened.But it got to a place, where this guy had cornered Mark's son. And Mark said, back off. Back off. The guy doesn't back off, so he shoves Mark.Now, word is, this guy is -- what do they call him, a tumbler? I think.He's a guy who, if you touch him, he falls down. Oh. Oh, my gosh --STU: A flopper. A flopper. He's like the Lebron James of the abortion clinics.GLENN: Apparently. Apparently.STU: Allegedly.GLENN: Allegedly. Okay. Thank you. So the police come, and they arrest the father of seven, for pushing this man to the ground. Planned Parenthood has got it all on tape. They got it on tape. So it goes to trial. And the case is dismissed.Wait a minute.I haven't heard that part of the story. The case was dismissed. I thought the FBI. Oh. Oh, yeah. The Justice Department, heard about this case. And thought it was so egregious, that if the local police and state police won't do anything about it, we certainly will.So they went in, kicking and screaming, into this house, of this family.They -- 25 or 30 FBI agents swarmed the property, 15 vehicles. It's 7 o'clock in the morning. They surround the house with rifles, in firing position. And they start pounding on the door, yelling for the family to open up the door. And he approaches. Now, the kids are upstairs. Everybody is screaming and crying. And he's telling them to calm down, and he's trying to calm the FBI down as well. He says, please, I am going to open the door. But please, my children are in the home. I have seven babies in the house. And they just kept pounding and screaming. The FBI did. When he opened the door, according to him, they had big, huge rifles, pointed at him and pointed at mom. And then they went into the house, and were pointing them throughout the house.When they came in, they ordered the kids to stay upstairs. The staircase is open. So the kids were all at the top of the stairs, which faces the front door. I was on the stairs as well, coming down. Kids were all just screaming. It was very scary and traumatic. After asking why they were at the house, the agents said, they had to have been there to arrest Mark. When mom asked for their warrant. They said they were going to take him, whether they had a warrant or not.When she said, that's kidnapping. You can't just come into a person's house and kidnap them at gun point, they agreed to get the warrant from -- for her, from one of the vehicles. Oh. Good. At this point, Mark asked her to get him a sweatshirt, and his rosary beads. When she returned, they had already loaded him up into the vehicle.Now, what did this guy do again, that warranted this?Our friends, who voted for Democrats, is this the America that you want? Any friend who votes differently, any American citizen that votes differently, do you want a guy getting his door kicked in, after the charges were dismissed in court? Do you want the FBI kicking down his door for pushing a guy, who was yelling at his son. Pushing him down for the ground?I'm not for violence. He's not for violence. He's reason been violent before.It was a dad responding. The court dismisses it. Is this the America that you want?Because once you get out of line, once you decide, if we don't all stand together now, you're not going to make it. You'll be the one finishing the poem, when they came for me, there was no one left. You will be the one finishing the poem. You have to stand up now. We have to stand up together. And say, the Department of Justice. And the FBI is completely out of control.I don't think the Postal Service, should be spying on American people.Another whistle-blower has come out from the FBI. To warn about the politicalization of the FBI. Saying, the bureau is spying on law-abiding citizens and that many of its domestic counterterrorism cases are tantamount to entrapment. Another FBI agent is coming out and saying this now. This is an interview with the Washington Times. Quote, my team was deployed 20 or 25 different high profile national terrorist organizations. Investigating what I saw, is the -- the counterterrorism and investigations. Is always and unequivocally morally equivalent to entrapment, even if there's legal definition that allows them to skirt that. They are using every tool.Isn't this what people did to Martin Luther King?Isn't this what people did when the government was completely out of control in the past? And isn't this exactly what others did to their political enemies in every country that has ever been run by thugs?I still believe in America. I still believe in my neighbor. I still believe in the neighbor that votes differently than me.I -- I think that there are a lot of people, that are feeling it now. But they don't know what to do. And they don't know if they want to lose all their friends. Their status. Because they're not really sure. Reassure them, that you're not the crazy one. Reassure them. Don't try to change their mind.Just ask them questions. Are you really -- are you really for the transgender -- you're really okay with hospitals mutilating young children, when there is no scientific proof that this is good? In fact, if you're trying to stop suicides, this makes suicides worse. You really -- I don't understand. And even if you're for that. Help me out on the trans library parties. I'm not for banning books. I don't want to ban books at libraries. Books where, in the children's section at a school. Yeah. There are books. I'm not going to put a Playboy there. You wouldn't put a Playboy there. Then why would you put this? It's much more explicit than a Playboy. And it's showing kids how to engage in all kinds of different sex. For first grade, third grade. Really? You're for that now?Wake your friends up. Wake them up. Because first they came for the January 6 protesters. Even the peaceful ones. And they charged them with parading. And I didn't speak out. Then they came for the gun rights supporters, and I didn't speak out. Because I wasn't a gun owner. Then they came for the pro-life activists, and I didn't speak out or stand up because, yeah, I'm pro-life. But I'm not an activist. Now they come for people who voted for Trump, but I didn't vote for Trump. I got news for you, that's 50 percent of the nation. You add in the hatred of white people, Asians. Cisgender, and gays that don't support trans, shown in libraries, that's an awful lot of people.Who will be left to defend you?   The mainstream media is collapsing as Vice Media and CBS News announce major changes. But now, progressives have talk radio in their sights. Glenn reviews the latest changes to the world of radio that could dismantle the entire system and crush free speech: George Soros is on the verge of taking control of Audacy, the second largest broadcaster in America; An investor based in Singapore is trying to take over Cumulus Media, the third largest broadcaster; And the FCC is forcing all broadcasters to start posting a race and gender scorecard on the demographics of their workforce. This is all an attempt to crush one of the last bastions of free speech, Glenn says.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: I want to give a mile-marker. I feel that part of my job is to inform you.What direction are we going in? And how fast are we going?Let me give you a couple of stories that are gravely, gravely concerning.I told you, last week, the Soros fund management, you know, run by billionaire George Soros and his son. Have now taken control or are on the verge of taking control of Audacy.Audacy is the second largest broadcaster in America. Only iHeartRadio owns more.And thank God, at this point, i Heart media. IHeartRadio has the Premiere Radio networks.I've worked for this company in one way or another, since 1989.They are my partner with this broadcast. And they have been always very, very supportive. If it wasn't for my partners, Julie Talbot and Dan Meador, and all of the people at i Heart media, who have just -- this show wouldn't be heard anywhere.So i Heart is the only one, right now, not under attack.And I will tell you about this. First, Audacy. Audacy amassed $1.9 billion in debt. They filed for bankruptcy.And now Soros is taking on the -- the fund, and they will be the largest shareholder, once the bankruptcy proceedings conclude. Where are we?They're dismantling radio.And buying radio up. Now, Soros has already bought, what?Last year. I think 50 radio stations that were all Spanish-speaking.Gee. Isn't that interesting?Now he's buying up, the second largest broadcaster in America.Audacy owns 220 stations. News Talk, in New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All some of the biggest news talk stations in the country.They own the -- the radio stations, including KDWM, in Las Vegas.Ph.D. Philadelphia.KDK in Pittsburgh. They have Dana Loesch on many other stations. They have Sean Hannity. Mark Levin. And George Soros has spent more than $21 billion over the last few decades.He spent 1.3 billion in 2022 alone. Most of that cash went to left-wing causes, including Media Matters, Planned Parenthood, the Sunrise Movement.He is the guy who has put in the radical DAs. And the radical attorneys general.And now, what?He's buying up talk radio. Why would you do that?Why would you buy all of these broadcasts?It seems like it's a failing industry, right? It's not.It's not. About 80 percent of the people, till listen to radio.80 percent. That's incredible. You think -- nobody listens to the radio. 80 percent still listen to the radio.Okay. So that is the second largest broadcaster, now going to George Soros.Then we have this.Cumulus. Cumulus used to be the ABC radio network. It used to be the largest. Now, I think it is the third largest.Cumulus is facing a takeover from an investor based in Singapore.Part of the process of their bankruptcy. It has asked for, and received from the FCC permission to become as much as 100 percent foreign-owned.So the third largest broadcaster, is about to go to a Singapore Holdings Company.How does this bid, for America?You have George Soros, and a Singapore can. And then i Heart, all alone.But don't worry, news for radio gets even better. Yesterday, Brenden Carr, he's an FCC commissioner. He came out and said, the FCC has just ordered every broadcaster to start posting a race and gender scorecard, that breaks down the demographics of their workforce.Activist lobbied for this, because they want to see businesses pressured into hiring people based on their race and gender. Courts have already overturned the FCC twice for pressuring broadcasters to making hiring decisions in violation of the Constitution.I dissent.This is a shot across our bow now, if the Supreme Court doesn't stop them again. We will now, if I want to be on radio, have to disclose, by the way.I don't have a problem doing this.I'm almost 2 percent Native American.So I'm a minority, inside of a minority.Anyway, we have to start hiring, based on gender and everything else.I don't care what, you know, male, female. I don't care who you sleep with. I don't care what color you are.I really don't.I want to know what's inside of your head.I want to know, how you think.Can you bring something different, that I don't bring to the table?That's how I hire.Can you fit what your different thinking is, into what I'm trying to accomplish?If you can, great!We're going to work together forever.Most of the people, that I work with, and I apologize for this. Spend their life with me.STU: Sort of feels that way.GLENN: Because we have a good working relationship. We all respect each other. Again, except for Stu.This is really, and let me give you another one. This is not about radio.Vice media, stops publishing on Vice.com. Slashes hundreds of jobs, amid mainstream media death spiral.So all of these mainstream media companies, they're all -- did you hear about CBS?And Catherine Herridge -- how do you say her name?Herridge. Right? I can't remember.Anyway, worked with her at Fox. We were obviously very close.But she's very, very credible.She's worked -- I don't agree with her all the time. But she's an actual journalist.And CBS News they just threw her out.She's gone. Now, they're saying, that's we've laid lots of people off, recently.Because we're collapsing.STU: That's their argument. For themselves.GLENN: Yeah. We're collapsing.Okay. Well, maybe. Or maybe a real journalist just isn't welcomed there anymore.I don't know.But everything, all of the media, what I said to Stu. And when we were at the height of Fox. I said, we have to get out of here.And everybody is like, what?Everybody works their whole life to get here. And I'm like, we have to get out of here.I said, this whole thing is going to burn itself down. It's all going to collapse.And here we are. It's all collapsing.But as I said at the time as well, if you're here, while it collapses, and you'll survive, you'll then be working for the government.Because all of these people, will get bail. They'll get bailed out by the federal government.We can't. These institutions are far too important. This has it goes back to your Cloward and Piven stuff from yesterday.It's worth watching. If you go to your Blaze TV account. You can watch it on demand.It's one of those situations.Vice is a great example of this.How many articles did vice write about how your career and life were collapsing.GLENN: Oh, my gosh.Over and over again.STU: Over and over again.And all these companies, writing for years. About how conservative media personalities were going to flame out, and their businesses were going to collapse, are now all gone.They're just -- they've all either dissolved. Or fired all their people. And AI is writing their articles.It is, sure, satisfying. For me. But it is -- it is embarrassing for them, I would assume.It's -- I don't know. Maybe they've all just -- they all moved on. They're all taking money from the government. And living at home now.Or working from home now.I don't know. It doesn't seem like they're able to keep any of these things afloat.How much -- how much money did Vice get?Billions and billions of dollars.Of just free investment cash. Dumped into that place.GLENN: Can you imagine if we would have had hundred --STU: Oh, my gosh.GLENN: Hundred million. Just 100 million. Compared to the billions that they had.Just 100 million -- 50 million in investment.Can you imagine what we could have done with it? Because we wouldn't have wasted it. They just wasted it.STU: Gone.GLENN: Gone.STU: And this is also while they're producing shows for HBO. I mean, they were handed a media empire, with let's be honest, no valid reason to be handed a media empire.I mean, like, vice did some interesting stuff early on.They were kind of the different. They just turn into the typical left-wing news source.And we were supposed to sit here and be like, oh, wow. This is amazing. It's innovative.Let's just throw money at these people. What do they do?The place is gone, basically.GLENN: We sat there, for I don't know how many meetings. I sat there with big, big companies, that were trying to figure out, how we were doing it.And at the time, we were doing it, more right than anybody else. We were still wrong.And we had no margin of error. Because it was all on me.And they were trying to figure out, you know, what do we do? What do we do?And I remember sitting in meetings going, your numbers don't make sense. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not an accountant. I'm not a good businessman.But I can look at this. You're selling what for what? And how do you even know that's true?And it was all hype. It was all hype.Now all that hype is over. And it's all falling apart. The mainstream media is falling apart.And look what's happening.You know, I mean, said recently, it's been quiet, on the western front.It's been all quiet for quite some time in talk radio.Haven't really had any attacks on talk radio. Been squished with digital. But on talk radio, haven't had a single problem.That's new.What was that all about?They forget about us?No. No. They're just going to take it.They're just going to take it in public/private partnerships. And the left, because our billionaires do nothing.Honest to God, our billionaires who believe in America, the only one that I know, that is actually putting his money where his mouth is. Is Donald Trump.I mean, there is a handful.STU: Yeah. I don't agree with that. There are some of these guys, very active. Not always publicly.GLENN: Yes. But George Soros.I mean, if you're going to stand up, stand up. Stand up.You want to stay in the shadows? That's fine.And I thank you for it. But get your friends to stand up. Why isn't -- we know the power of talk radio.We know the power of radio. Where are our billionaires? Why aren't they stepping to the plate?Why?Anyway, I want you to do me a favor.I want you to support your local radio station. The station that is -- is running this program.Please, support them. Please, buy the advertising.If you -- I'm not asking to you buy something you don't need.If you hear somebody advertising.Something like, okay. I need that.Or I'm looking at that. Please, go to that store, or whatever.Local radio is critical. Critical.You've got to have a local radio station. That is not controlled by the Borge (phonetic).We thank our sponsors, and we thank our local radio stations. Our affiliates. You're the heart of us. Thank you.   New Yorks $355 million civil fraud charge against former president Donald Trump just got MORE INSANE. The charge was already unprecedented. But Glenn and Stu reveal how New York has handled previous similar cases  including the MUCH WORSE actions taken by other companies charged under this rule. This is so obviously a targeted attack against Trump, Glenn argues: There is no way that I would keep my business in New York. There is no rule of law now.    Below is a rush transcript that may contain errors GLENN: Okay. Hello, Stu.STU: Glenn!You know, I was thinking about this big lawsuit.GLENN: Yeah.STU: Against the president, former president.First, he had the $83 million from E. Jean Carroll situation.GLENN: Which was really caused by him.STU: This was an interesting point.He got, I think a totally false accusation against him.GLENN: Yeah. Totally false.STU: He said, this was false, this is crazy. He fought it. They went through this case. I think he totally got screwed.And they ruled against him for a few million dollars. And they said, basically, you can't go on and talk about this anymore.And he just did.He was like, I don't care what you say.GLENN: Yeah. And you know what, you have that right, to do that. If that's what you -- you know, if that's what you want.STU: He knew what the price of that was. Yes, correct.STU: He knew the price would be high.And sometimes, occasionally, people made the point, that Donald Trump, you know, creates some of his own issues. Okay?GLENN: Yes. But he also has what I like to call FU money.STU: He has FU money. Right. Exactly.GLENN: 85 million, it's worth it. She sucks.STU: Sometimes people have pointed out. That when he makes some of his own problems, he will still say he's the victim of persecution.He will kind of go to that -- that's kind of the way it goes.And some have noticed this over time. But might I address this lawsuit, that came down, and this ruling in New York.GLENN: $355 million. It will cost him over 400 million, when it's all said and done.By the way, ruling yesterday, the same -- or, the same Supreme Court justice.Said with that he of some provided a good reason, as to why he should delay the judgment from last week.So he said, you failed to explain much less justify any basis for a stay. I'm confident that the appellate division will protect your appellate rights. So he has to cough this up.Now, they're talking about, this is so much money, that he's going to have to put up, probably real estate and sell the -- some real estate to be able to pay for this.Because you have to put -- you have to put that money into a bond.And then you have a bond holder, holding it for you.STU: Right.GLENN: And you have to pay them an additional fee.STU: Right. Right. And then hopefully, you win the appeal. And eventually, don't have to pay it then.GLENN: It will still cost you about 50 million. This has it will still suck.GLENN: Yeah. Yeah.STU: But talking about whether he's the victim of political persecution. I believe this case, it's actually provable.GLENN: Oh, yeah.STU: Like it is -- but it's not just, oh, yeah.It's not the just, oh, yeah. Well, of course.Because I think on its face, that's how I react to this.Right? He's running for president of the United States. They're trying to put him out of business.Throw him in prison.Take him off the ballots.It's so blatantly obvious, on the surface. That that's how I translate it.GLENN: The only thing he hasn't been hit with is, you know.Like, here. Have some uranium pie.STU: Right. That's true.GLENN: The only thing, is he's not been hit with an umbrella, or the little pin at the end of it. Like the CIA.STU: That's about it. That's it.And so I think on its surface, it's easy to just look at this. The details of this one, in particular, are so egregious.First of all, it's not like, a -- this number that they came up with. They just came up with like an algorithm that they built to come up with this number.And it's like, well, we think, if he didn't defraud these banks, then the banks would have made more money.Now, of course, the banks could have gone to have, and requested a higher interest rate. Which they didn't do.GLENN: Because they found him a good risk. Because they've done business with him before.STU: Before. And they all knew he had lots of money. And they all knew he had a successful business.They all knew he would pay back the loans. They all knew this would occur.So they went down this road. Now, of course, their case in New York. Hey, you defaulted all these banks. Screwed all these banks out of money.You have to pay $350 million to us.GLENN: Right.STU: The state of New York.GLENN: Because the banks --STU: The banks get none of this.GLENN: They didn't file this.There was no complaint. None.STU: Even if you think there was no complaint.If you're saying, they were defrauded. You would think, they would get the money.But no. It goes directly to the state of New York. Which is just another comical layer to this.But listen to this breakdown of this particular rule. This law. And how it's been used, in the past.Because as you point out. There's no victims here. No one is coming.No bank is like, hey. By the way, he lied about this. It didn't work out for us.GLENN: In fact, the banks testified on his behalf. Saying, there was no victim.We knew this. We take that into account with everybody we loan.That's why we have a whole division that goes out, and does the estimates for us.We know. We're not stupid.STU: Right. So this law has been around for 70 years.And it is -- there is multiple facets of this.There's the big fine.Which is kind of the headline.Also, the fact that they might take his business away.They're saying his kids can't run the business anymore.They're trying to turn this into essentially a death penalty for this company.GLENN: Yes, they are.So it is the only big business. That was threatened with a shutdown without showing obvious victims or majors losses in 70 years.The only one. Okay?The AP went the lie 150 cases, since New York's repeated fraud statute was passed in 1956.And it showed that nearly every previous time, a company was taken away. Victims and losses were key factors.You would think, right?Customers lose money, because they bought defective products or never received services ordered. Leaving them cheated and angry.What's more, businesses were taken over, almost always as a last resort to stop a fraud in progress, to protect potential victims.Let's look back at this now, because there is one case where they try to take a company. Which is what they're threatening here, with the Trump Corporation. The Trump Corporation.GLENN: Hang on.Do we have that clip of -- of the AGs saying that they will take it? Here it is. Listen.VOICE: Four days after a judge ordered Donald Trump to pay $355 million for a decade of fraud.New York attorney general, Letitia James says, she's prepared to do everything she can, to make sure the former president pays his fine. Including, she told us, seizing the businesses that have his name.VOICE: If he does not have funds to pay off the judgment, then we will seek, you know, judgment enforcement mechanisms in court. And we will ask the judge to seize his assets.STU: I love the -- she's so dramatic. It's hilarious.GLENN: I know. I know. Think of that. You're doing business in this morning.STU: Oh, I would get out of there. You have to get out of there.GLENN: Get out of there. And honestly, if you live in New York, honestly, you have a house in New York, you're living in New York. You're just like, yeah. Well, we don't want to give up on New York.Get the hell out of New York.And I know a lot of people that say, well, I can't. Because my whole family is here.Get out, of New York.If they're doing this kind of stuff to him, there is no rule of law in New York.Okay?STU: It's always been liberal, right? This is totally different.It's like the difference between the New York Times.We were talking about this the other day. Where the New York Times is always liberal.Then there was, hey, this is an op-ed written by a US senator.And the op-ed guy gets fired for just letting it be printed.GLENN: Right.STU: The crazy people on the left. The AOC's have taken over, places in the media.And places like this in New York.This is what it is thousand. So there's been one case. One. One in the entire seven years. Where they did this.Where they shut down a company, that had no obvious victims.The case was 1972.And it was a company, relatively small company, that was writing term papers, for college students. Okay.So I want to write my paper.GLENN: I want to break out in God bless America.STU: Capitalism is pretty impressive. Apparently, this didn't go over that well.What they said, there were no obvious victims here. The people bought the term papers. They didn't want to write them. They got the term papers. They said, they were defrauding the education system.GLENN: Which they were.STU: This is the one time. And it's a small tiny company. Let me give you the other times they've done this.Tell me if any of these sound like, hey, I have a good interest rate, on a loan I paid back.Number one, a breast cancer nonprofit was shut down a dozen years ago. For using nearly all its $9 million in donations to pay for director's salaries, perks, and other expenses, instead of funding free mammograms. Okay.So they told everyone, donate money for free. Mammograms. And they just took all the money for themselves.That's number one. Number two, a private equity timber.Faking big investment success, was closed down after stealing millions of dollars from thousands of investors.Okay?You can see.GLENN: Yeah. Got it. But on both of those so far, you have hundreds of thousands of people, you know, I'm sure. That gave -- they're all victims.They gave their money.STU: Yeah. And they didn't get the thing that they want.GLENN: They didn't get the thing they were promised. You have all these people going to the AG. Saying, hey, this is a real problem here. This has to stop. Not here.GLENN: Not here.STU: Another one. Mental health facility, shuttered for looting $4 million from public funds, while neglecting patients.GLENN: Okay. Kind of a big one.STU: Pretty clear. An auto lender that allegedly charged hidden interest rates, got to stay in business last year if it paid a fine and didn't commit fraud in the future.So here's one they didn't shut down.They actually let them go on.They're going after Trump in all of this. In this one, they're like, oh. Sure, they're hidden fees.They're not telling you about them.GLENN: Okay.STU: A judge requested.A judge refused to request to shut down a river rafting company in 2011.After a customer drowned, and the attorney general showed it was repeatedly using unlicensed guides, or none at all.Instead, he ordered only a 50,000-dollar bond and cleanup -- for him to clean up his act.The company is still being run today, under a different name by the same family. Someone died.GLENN: We have thousands of victims.And in this case, somebody who is dead.STU: Is dead!GLENN: Dead!STU: They're like, you guys can stay open -- and then this one is my favorite one. A judge in 2001.Declined to appoint a receiver, to take over a porn site, despite millions of dollars of illegal credit card charges to hundreds of customers.Who thought they were getting a free tour.Now, look, you're -- you want to get the free -- you want to know what you're subscribing for, Glenn. Before you just pulled the trigger on that. So you put your credit card information into a porn site, I think some of these victims need some life changes to be made here.But they put their credit card into a porn site. Expecting a free tour.They instead, get charged and charged and charged and charged.In fact, once the owners of the site were caught, they attempted to move their money overseas, to avoid any penalty.Still, the judge said, appointing a receiver was an extraordinary remedy!That should be used sparingly, and that a preliminary injunction was good enough.Only after all that happened, it they find out, the people running the porn site, were the Gambino crime family.(laughter)I kid you not. The Gambino crime family.GLENN: And they didn't go into receivership.STU: So there you go. Thi",,-4,-4
