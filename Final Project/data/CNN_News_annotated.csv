CNNNews_1,"             CVS and Walgreens said theyve received certification to dispense mifepristone, a pill thats part of a regimen for medication abortion, and will start making the medicine available in a limited number of states where its legal.                   CVS told CNN that itll begin filling prescriptions for mifepristone in Massachusetts and Rhode Island in the weeks ahead and plans to expand to more states, where allowed by law, on a rolling basis.                   Walgreens told CNN that it expects to start dispensing mifepristone within a week, consistent with federal and state laws, and is beginning in select locations in New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, California and Illinois. The pharmacy giant said its starting with a phased rollout to allow us to ensure quality, safety and privacy for our patients, providers and team members.       Related article Few large employers alter abortion coverage after Supreme Court ruling               Both pharmacy chains noted that they already dispense misoprostol, the other medication involved in medication abortion regimens.                   Medication abortion is the most common method of abortion in the United States, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Its approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use up to 10 weeks into pregnancy.                   Mifepristone has been at the center of legal challenges in the US, and the Supreme Court said in December that it would consider whether to restrict access to it, with a decision expected by July.                   The New York Times first reported Friday that CVS and Walgreens plan to sell mifepristone.                   The FDA issued an update to guidelines around how mifepristone may be dispensed in January 2023, allowing the drug to be provided by certified pharmacies on a prescription issued by a certified prescriber.                   Before then, the FDA required certified prescribers to dispense the drug directly to patients at a clinic, medical office or hospital, referred to as the in-person dispensing requirement. The drug was also available through mail-order pharmacies, as the agency said it wouldnt enforce the in-person requirement during the Covid-19 pandemic.                   President Joe Biden called the news ??an important milestone in ensuring access to mifepristone, a drug that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as safe and effective for more than 20 years.??

Some 12% of large firms whose biggest plan covers abortion under most or all circumstances added or expanded abortion coverage after the ruling, found KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research organization. Some 3% reduced or eliminated coverage for abortion where it is legal.                   Only about one third of large firms that provide health insurance cover abortion in most or all circumstances in their largest plan; while 28% dont cover it at all or only in limited circumstances, such as rape, incest or life endangerment.                   Some 40% of respondents to KFFs Employer Health Benefits Survey in 2023 said they didnt know whether their largest plan covers abortion  possibly because of limited information about abortion coverage in the plan documents unless it is explicitly excluded.                   A bigger share of the largest firms  those with 5,000 or more workers ?? covers abortion, compared to firms with between 200 and 999 staffers. Large public employers, such as state and local governments, were less likely to provide abortion coverage than private for profit or nonprofit firms.

CNNNews_3,"             France is one step closer to enshrining abortion rights in its constitution after French senators overwhelmingly endorsed the change on Wednesday.                   A total of 267 senators voted in favor of the change, with 50 voting against it. The constitutional amendment faces a final test next Monday when it needs to secure the backing of three-fifths of lawmakers at a joint congress of parliament, which will see both houses vote together.                   ??I am committed to making women??s freedom to have an abortion irreversible by enshrining it in the constitution,?? Emmanuel Macron said in a post on X, celebrating the Senate vote.                   The bid for constitutionalization became a priority for the French government following the overturning by the United States Supreme Court of Roe v. Wade in June 2022, though the cause has been championed for several years by left-wing lawmakers and women??s rights activists.                   Currently, abortion rights in France are protected by a 1975 law which has been amended on numerous occasions, most recently in 2022, to lengthen the time frame for legal abortions from 12 to 14 weeks of pregnancy. Like all laws, however, it could be revoked by a vote in the French parliament.                   The move has overwhelming support from the French public, according to polling, but has faced criticism from right-wing lawmakers. Backers of the bill say constitu",4,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CNNNews_4,"             Egyptian papyrus, Greek plays, Roman coins, the medieval biographies of saints, medical and midwifery manuals, and Victorian newspaper and pamphlets reveal that abortion was more common in premodern times than people might think.                   This long view of abortion matters, according to Mary Fissell, a professor of the history of medicine at Johns Hopkins University. Thats because assumptions about how abortion was viewed in the past color present-day arguments about abortion rights. Those rights have been severely restricted in many US states since Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that effectively made abortion legally available, was overturned on June 24, 2022, by the US Supreme Court in Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization.                   Abortion opponents portray the rights granted by Roe v. Wade and legal access to abortion as an historical aberration, according to Fissell, which is not accurate, historians say.                   We have to understand that this is much more changeable than weve been led to believe. Theres a steady constant of women terminating pregnancies throughout history, but the meanings of that act have changed very significantly over time and will continue to change, said Fissell, who is working on Long Before Roe, a book on the history of abortion that will publish in 2025.                   The Dobbs decision was not inevitable, but rather a part of a much longer cycle of restriction versus acceptance, she said. ?               The first written references to abortion are contained in an ancient Egyptian papyrus written about 3,500 years ago. The Ebers Papyrus, a medical text, suggested around 1550 BC that abortion could be induced using a plant-fibre tampon coated with a compound that included honey and crushed dates.               In ancient Greek and Rome, references to abortion and botanical substances that induce abortion were common in medical and other texts  although its not clear how widely they were used, Fissell said.                   In 411 BC, Greek playwright Aristophanes in his play Lysistrata described a desirable young woman as trimmed and spruced with pennyroyal, a plant thought to induce abortion.                   Plants and botanical substances can have toxic effects, and theres no evidence on whether historical methods to induce abortion were effective or not.                   In ancient Rome, another plant that was thought to end an unwanted pregnancy (among other uses), was so valued it disappeared  the first recorded extinction in world history, according to archaeologist Lisa Briggs, a research fellow at Cranfield University and a visiting researcher at the British Museum.                   Silphium, also used to flavor food, was traded across the ancient Roman empire. The city state of Cyrene (in modern-day Libya), the only region where the plant grew, based its whole economy on the plant. It appeared on coins and other artifacts unearthed from the region, Briggs said.                   Contemporary authors said it was worth its weight in gold and silver. And so it clearly had a value beyond just its tastiness. I suspect that womens desire to use it as an abortifacient is one of the reasons the price was driven up, said Briggs, who is searching for archaeological evidence of the plant, which was turned into a resin, in shipwrecks and museum collections.                   Pliny the Elder, a Roman author and philosopher who was born around 23 AD, described the plants ability to expel an unborn fetus along with other medical uses. Its impossible to know for sure whether the plant would have had the desired effect, but modern-day studies on related Ferula plants and lab rats showed the plants exhibit anti-fertility properties in rodents, Briggs wrote in a paper she coauthored last year.                Briggs believes demand for the plant among women may have been a key factor, although not the only reason, for its extinction. The plant was resistant to cultivation, Briggs noted, and climate change and a shift in soil characteristics may also have been factors.                Its sometimes assumed that Christianity has always unequivocally condemned abortion but Maeve Callan, a professor and historian of religion at Simpson College in Iowa, said this misrepresents the past.                   People act like theres only one acceptable attitude towards abortion if youre Catholic, or if youre Christian more broadly, or even if youre religious more broadly. And theres always been a diversity of viewpoints, said Callan, the author of the book ??Sacred Sisters: Gender, Sanctity, and Power in Medieval Ireland.??                   Her research, along with other scholars, has uncovered four medieval Irish saints who celebrated ending pregnancy among their miracles, according to medieval manuscripts that described saints?? lives. Typically, these miracles include a nun who has breached her vow to chastity and become pregnant but, through th",6,,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CNNNews_5,"             Good luck trying to keep on top of the fight for abortion rights in the US. Its everywhere, all over the map, and its all happening right now.                   A GOP proposal, introduced Tuesday by Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, would impose a national abortion ban after 15 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions for rape or incest or to protect the life of the mother.                    Graham noted the proposal would put the US in line with many European countries. The big difference is US states would still be able to impose stricter abortion bans like those going into effect in multiple states.                   Grahams bill is meant to counter a bipartisan proposal introduced in the Senate last month that would bring back the Roe v. Wade standard of fetal viability.                    Republicans who hope to take control of the House and Senate are fearful that the issue could turn public opinion against them and are hoping that Grahams proposal will offer abortion rights opponents something to support in November.                   There is a sort of balance here, because neither a proposal to legalize abortion nor one to ban it has much chance of gaining the supermajority of 60 votes needed to become law, since the Senate is beholden to the filibuster. Anger at the Supreme Court for taking away the right American women had for nearly 50 years is more likely to motivate voters in Novembers midterm elections.       Interactive map: See where abortion is banned  and where its still in limbo   West Virginia lawmakers pass abortion ban. The states two legislative chambers passed a ban that offers exceptions to victims of rape and incest, but only within eight weeks of pregnancy for adults and 14 weeks for minors, and only if the crimes are reported to law enforcement.        A near-total abortion ban goes into effect in Indiana on Thursday. Indiana was the first state in August to pass such a restrictive law since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Other bans were triggered by the courts decision.                    Indianas new law includes exceptions for saving the life of the mother and for fatal fetal anomalies up to 20 weeks post-fertilization, and it allows exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rape and incest.       A filibuster by Republicans to protect the absolute minimum abortion rights in South Carolina. It was a few Republicans, including all three of the chambers female GOP members, who shut down a near-total abortion ban proposal in South Carolina last week. Read the story by CNNs Veronica Stracqualursi, Andi Babineau and Jon Passantino.                    A six-week abortion ban had earlier passed in the state, but is the subject of a court fight, so a 20-week ban is currently in effect there.                    The CNN report included this quote from a Republican lawmaker in the state who was among the few that blocked the near-total ban pushed by her colleagues:       If you want to believe that God is wanting you to push a bill through with no exception that kills mothers and ruins the lives of children, lets mothers bring home babies to bury them, then I think youre miscommunicating with God or maybe youre just not communicating with him at all, Republican Sen. Katrina Shealy said Wednesday in a fiery speech on the Senate floor directed toward her male colleagues.   I know we disagree on a lot of issues, but hearing you talk about menstrual cycles, conception, how you know when your egg is fertilized or having a baby, I got to tell you it really disgusts me.   A vote is coming in Michigan.

CNNNews_6,"  Supreme Court pushes divided nation closer to breaking point with new fights over abortion               Theres so much misinformation, so many myths about abortion. Abortion will lead to substance abuse, depression, suicidal thoughts; abortion is bad for your health; every woman is going to regret it, said social psychologist Brenda Major, a distinguished professor emeritus in the department of psychological and brain sciences at the University of California, Santa Barbara.                   In reality, decades of research has shown the vast majority of women feel they made the right choice, and they dont experience regret, said Major, who led a 2008 American Psychological Association task force exploring the science on abortion and mental health.                    Women who had an abortion in the first trimester were no more likely to have mental health problems than women who continued with an unplanned pregnancy, the APA review concluded.                   A large, long-term study, called The Turnaway Study, followed the mental health of nearly 1,000 women in 21 states who wanted and received an abortion and women who wanted but were denied an abortion between 2008 and 2010.                   The women were interviewed every six months over the next five years. At the end of that time, 99% of the women who had an abortion believed they had made the right decision  in fact relief was the prominent emotion, one analysis noted.                   Women who received an abortion had similar or lower levels of depression and anxiety than women denied an abortion and were no more likely to experience post-traumatic stress than women who carried their baby to term, according to study results.                   The research also found no difference in mental health outcomes between a first trimester abortion and having an abortion later in the pregnancy.                   Abortion misinformation might come from friends or family, an article or study read online, or during a mandated pre-abortion counseling session some states put into place during the Roe v. Wade era, experts told CNN.        The Catholic Church once allowed for abortions. Everything changed in 1873               Of the 33 states that have required patients receive counseling before an abortion, eight routinely included the potential for negative psychological responses as part of the conversation, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit research and policy organization that focuses on sexual and reproductive rights worldwide.                   There are states in which women are told that because theyre having an abortion, theyre at increased risk for depression, suicidal ideation, post traumatic stress disorder and more, said Julia Steinberg, an associate professor of family science at the University of Marylands School of Public Health.                   Abortion does not cause depression, it does not cause suicide (or) suicidal ideation. It does not cause substance use. It does not cause anxiety disorders, said Steinberg, who has studied the mental health impact of abortion for years.                   In fact, the best predictor of not faring well after an abortion was a prior history of mental health issues, Major said. The best predictor of substance use after an abortion was if you were already a substance abuser, and the best predictor of depression after abortion was if youve been depressed before you had one.                   Abortion misinformation also comes from published studies in academic journals that conclude abortion does cause mental health problems, experts say.                   The studies make it look like there is a debate, but whats really going on is those studies are very poorly conducted, Steinberg said. They are not methodologically rigorous, and they dont adhere to scientific principles.                   The 2008 APA task force published a scathing rebuke of the research quality of many studies which found mental health concerns after abortion. Studies often failed to control for factors such as rape, sexual or partner violence, or a womans history of prior mental disorders or substance abuse, the task force said.                   We reviewed every legitimate study that had ever been done on this topic, Major said. The methodological flaws in so many of the studies that are being cited as showing harm to womens mental health as a result of having an abortion were just egregious.                   A later 2018 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine review analyzed studies on abortions impact on future fertility and pregnancy outcomes, risk of breast cancer, mental health disorders, and premature death.                   ??Much of the published literature on these topics fails to meet scientific standards for rigorous, unbiased research,?? the report stated, concluding that ??having an abortion does not increase a woman??s risk of secondary infertility, pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders, abnormal placentation (after a D&E abortion), preterm birth, breast cancer, or mental health disorders (d",7,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CNNNews_7,"             Nearly a quarter of people seeking an abortion in the United States were unable to get one due to bans that took effect after the Supreme Courts Dobbs decision, researchers estimate. In the first half of 2023, states with abortion bans had an average fertility rate that was 2.3% higher than states where abortion was not restricted, according to the analysis  leading to about 32,000 more births than expected.        States with restrictive abortion laws place more kids in foster care, particularly kids of color               The findings are based on preliminary births data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The research has not yet been peer-reviewed but experts say the data paints a clear picture about the direct impact of abortion restrictions.                   Its an assault on reproductive autonomy, said Alison Gemmill, an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. She was not involved in the new analysis, but has published research on the effect that a strict abortion law had on births in Texas.                   We dont always detect signals in these population aggregates because theres a lot of variation when you group everybody together. The fact that there is a signal at the population level means that somethings really going on. Its pretty strong evidence.                   Fertility rates  the number of births per women of reproductive age  dont typically change dramatically. A shock like Covid-19, for example, led to a temporary baby bust, said Gemmill, who has also researched infertility during the pandemic. The 4.5% decrease in fertility rate in the first year of the pandemic was the largest in decades, according to CDC data.        Abortions increased in the US overall in the year post-Dobbs, but there are stark inequalities state-to-state   Other research has found that the number of abortions increased nationwide in the year following the Dobbs decision, with especially large increases in states that border those with bans. But complete data on the number of abortions provided to people who crossed states lines for their care is not yet available, and the new research suggests that travel remains a significant barrier to access.                   After the Dobbs decision, fertility rates increased most significantly in states with longer travel times to the nearest abortion providers, the new research found, including a 5.1% increase in Texas and a 4.4% increase in Mississippi.                   Abortions have been trending up in the US for years. But rising birth rates could indicate that unmet need persists, despite an increase in the number of abortions in the year post-Dobbs.                   ??One might think that those data conflict,?? said Ushma Upadhyay, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco??s Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health. She was not involved in the new analysis, but is co-chair of the #WeCount project that tracks abortion trends. ??But in actuality, we??ve known that there are many people who still can??t get abortions.??

CNNNews_8,"             Amid significant upheaval to the abortion landscape in the United States, thousands of women have preemptively requested medication abortion pills in case they need them in the future, new research shows.                   Aid Access, a nonprofit telehealth service, provides medication abortion by mail. The organization has offered advance provision of those drugs, mifepristone and misoprostol, for more than two years  and demand has surged over the past year and a half since the leak of the US Supreme Courts Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade.        Post-Roe, nearly 1 in 5 people seeking an abortion traveled out of state, analysis finds               In the first eight months that Aid Access offered advance provision of medication abortion  from September 2021 through April 2022  it received an average of 25 orders a day, according to research published Tuesday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. But in the two months after the Dobbs decision was leaked, from May 2022 to late June 2022, daily requests spiked nearly tenfold to about 247 orders a day.                   Requests slowed for a while after the Dobbs decision was formally released, with an average of 89 orders per day from late June 2022 through early April 2023. But demand spiked again as conflicting legal rulings created uncertainty around approval for mifepristone, with more than 170 requests per day through the end of April.                   Dr. Abigail Aiken, an associate professor of public affairs at the University of Texas at Austin, who led the research, says the study shows that its?the potential policy shocks that people are reacting to. &?Its?the idea that people are paying attention and getting out ahead of things.                   What were seeing there really is a response to the fear and the uncertainty and feelings of, I guess, helplessness that the Dobbs decision brought for people, Aiken said. When the leak happened, I think the writing was on the wall and people thought,?I?need to get out ahead of this.                   Overall, Aid Access has received more than 48,000 orders for advance provision of medication abortion, according to the new research. About three-quarters of people who requested it said that they wanted to ensure personal health and choice or prepare for possible abortion restrictions.                   States considering future abortion bans had the highest rates of requests, and requestors were motivated by a desire to preserve reproductive autonomy, the researchers wrote.        How safe is the abortion pill compared with other common drugs?               Compared with those requesting medication abortion to end an existing pregnancy, people requesting advance provision of medication abortion were more likely to be wealthier, White, age 30 or older and not have other children. These differences probably reflect structural barriers, the researchers wrote.                   The structural barriers that could have influenced who was more likely to order medication abortion pills in advance include their cost and access to information about them, Aiken said. The service can cost more than $100, although Aid Access offers a sliding scale for those who need it, and people with fewer means are less likely to be able to spend that much to order medication?they??re?not certain to n",4,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CNNNews_9," A version of this story appeared in CNNs What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free?here.               The post-Roe v. Wade landscape for American women includes the term court-ordered abortion due to a troubling case in Texas, consideration of a Civil War-era abortion law in Arizona and the US Supreme Court announcing it would revisit the issue for the first time since removing nationwide abortion rights last year.                   There are very different realities for women across the country:                   ? A Texas womans horror story raised serious questions about whether women who need life-saving exceptions to abortion bans can actually obtain them.                   The woman, 31-year-old Kate Cox, had to flee the state, which has one of the strictest abortion laws in the country, to end a pregnancy where the fetus had a fatal condition. Her doctor said it would jeopardize her life and future fertility. The states Republican-dominated Supreme Court wanted more guidance from the states medical board before granting an exception.                   ? Lawyers for a woman who is the lead plaintiff in a class action lawsuit challenging Kentuckys six-week abortion ban said her pregnancy is no longer viable, which could call the lawsuit into question.                   ? Abortion rights opponents argued before Arizonas Supreme Court in favor of reverting to an 1864 law that predates Arizonas statehood and could send abortion providers to prison.                   ? In New Mexico, which has a more liberal abortion law, the state Supreme Court is considering whether to strike down local restrictions at the city and county levels.                   ? Michigans governor signed a new law to do away with restrictions on abortion rights and no longer require women to obtain a special abortion rider in their health insurance plans.                   ? At the national level, the US Supreme Court agreed to consider whether to restrict the access of every American woman to mifepristone, the long-approved medication behind most early term US abortions.        How safe is the abortion pill compared with other common drugs?               Court whisperers say that case may not, as many American women worried when they read the headlines, jeopardize access to the medication, which has been safely used in conjunction with another drug as an abortion method for nearly a quarter century.                   The details of that case get complicated and include multiple Food and Drug Administration actions since 2000. Biden administration lawyers have argued the anti-abortion rights doctors who brought the case lack standing because they dont themselves prescribe the drugs or perform abortions.       Read CNNs report on the courts decision to hear the case.                   Its most likely the case will be resolved on procedural grounds that wont have any direct effect on access to mifepristone going forward, Steve Vladeck, a CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas Law School, told CNNs Devan Cole and Ariane de Vogue.                   CNNs Supreme Court biographer Joan Biskupic writes this analysis of the courts move: The most personal choices of women (with their physicians) are now litigated in courtrooms, alongside new policy dilemmas, such as over governments approval of mifepristone. She adds that the federal government is also challenging Idahos near total abortion ban based on its reading of Medicare law.                   Texas and Idaho are two of the 14 states in which abortion is essentially banned. But even in red states, voters have taken the opposite direction of GOP-dominated legislatures.                   CNN??s Deidre McPhillips reported on a steep rise in the number of women ?C up to 20% of women seeking abortions in the US ?C traveling in order to obtain care.                   She writes: ??Nearly three-quarters of the abortions in New Mexico were provided to people who had traveled across state lines, according to the new data from the Guttmacher Institute. More than 8,200 people from out of state had an abortion in New Mexico in the first half of 2023. Only Illinois and North Carolina saw more out-of-state patients.??

CNNNews_10,"             I was standing there watching her hemorrhage out, waiting for permission to do the termination. It is a disgusting feeling. It is a sad feeling. And youre sitting there literally watching her blood pressure going down while youre waiting for permission, the Chair of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of South Florida told CNN. Its just sad to now know & that that will be happening all over across the country where [terminating a pregnancy] wont even be a possibility for a lot of states.                   Dr. Louis and other health care experts fear that with Roe v. Wade overturned, potential widespread abortion bans will deepen the United States maternal mortality crisis./ Health care experts told CNN they worry that reducing access to abortion  by closing clinics, setting early gestational limits or outlawing the procedure altogether  may lead to more pregnancy-related deaths in the United States.                   Rates of pregnancy-related deaths in the US are the highest in the developed world and have risen steadily over time, with Black women three times more likely to die in pregnancy or childbirth than White women. The CDC recently reported that the rate of pregnancy-related deaths increased from 20.1 in 2019 to 23.8 in 2020, continuing a worrying trend of worsening maternal health outcomes for people in the United States.                   Now that the Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade, 26 states are poised to ban abortion through pre-existing bans or trigger laws that will now go into effect without the landmark ruling is no longer in place. As a result, more than 10 million people of reproductive age would have to cross state lines to access the procedure in the nearest state where it is legal, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy institute that supports legal abortion rights.                   [People] may seek unsafe ways of terminating a pregnancy and could have harmful consequences, said Whitney Rice, the director of the Center for Reproductive Health Research in the Southeast at Emory University. You also have people who may sort of be forced to continue pregnancies to term and could have a risk of infant health outcomes that include low birth weight, preterm birth, or may have a risk of maternal mortality.                   Maternal mortality rates are already high in those states certain or likely to ban abortion  47% higher than the national rate, according to a CNN analysis of 2018 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the most recent available.                    Overall, states with the most restrictive abortion laws had a 7% higher maternal mortality rate than states with fewer restrictions, according to a 2021 study in the American Journal of Public Health.                    States that restricted abortion based on gestational limits saw a steep rise in the maternal mortality rate by 38%, according to a 2020 study in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine. A 20% reduction in Planned Parenthood clinics in a state between 2007-2015 resulted, on average, in an increase in the states maternal mortality rates by 8%.                   Black people are three times more likely to die of pregnancy-related causes than non-Hispanic White and Hispanic people, according to the CDC. With reduced access to abortion and other forms of reproductive healthcare, experts worry that these rates could rise in a post-Roe landscape.                   These disparities are rooted in decades of structural disadvantages and well-documented discrimination in medical care, leading to persisting gaps across socioeconomic and educational levels.                    [Marginalized groups] really face barriers in every sense of the way, said Dr. Louis. They face barriers in terms of getting care in a timely fashion, barriers in being able to see a health care provider, and then barriers to getting the appropriate treatment. And thats even if theyre offered appropriate treatment.                   Access to maternal care is also worse in the 26 states that the Guttmacher Institute expects will be certain or likely to ban abortion. More than half of all counties in these states are classified as having low access to maternal care or are maternity-care deserts, according to a CNN analysis of data from the March of Dimes, compared to 39% of counties in states that are not likely to ban abortion if Roe is overturned.                   Nationwide, approximately 5.1 million women aged 15-44 live in areas with low access to maternal care ?? or ??maternity care deserts,?? according to a 2020 report from the March of Dimes, a nonprofit that advocates for better health care outcomes for mothers and babies.

CNNNews_11,"             The Columbia, Maryland, couple were thrilled when she quickly became pregnant, but about nine and a half weeks in, she miscarried. It was devastating, but the doctor said it happens. They tried again.                   She would have three more consecutive miscarriages, which required a procedure called dilation and curettage, often called a D&C, to remove the tissue, before fertility specialists found the right combination of treatments for her, which included in vitro fertilization.         Women share how access to abortion impacted their lives -- whether they chose one or not               For her fifth pregnancy, McRae and her doctors wanted to increase the odds that she would have a child. They fertilized multiple eggs, selected the four with the best chances of making it to term, and implanted them in hopes of at least one fetus developing successfully, she said.                    They all took.                   Four high-risk pregnancy specialists told McRae there was no way she and all four fetuses would survive the pregnancy. They had to selectively abort two of the fetuses to preserve the chances of her and the other two surviving. After all that time and heartbreak, terminating two of the fetuses was one of the hardest things she ever had to go through, but she went through with the procedure.                    Twenty-three years ago, she gave birth to twin daughters. Three years later, that first in vitro process helped her get pregnant with her son. She would go through it all again to have them, she said.                   Had these laws gone into effect (back then and) if I was in a state that was not protected, I would not be a mother or I would be dead, McRae said. I would have been prevented possibly from having the D&Cs, possibly penalized for having miscarriages.                   McRae was devastated when she learned about the US Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. She said her daughter now worries that she wont have the chance to become a mother, knowing how integral abortion was to McRae maintaining and surviving pregnancy.                   The McRaes arent the only ones concerned. Terminating embryos is still often part of treatment for miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies and IVF, all of which are fairly common, said Dr. John Zhang, founder and medical director of New Hope Fertility Center in New York City.       A 2015 study found that 1% to 2% of all pregnancies are ectopic. About 2% of babies in the US are born with the assistance of IVF, said Sean Tipton, chief advocacy, policy and development officer for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. And 10% to 20% of known pregnancies end in miscarriage, according to the Mayo Clinic.                   The decision from the Supreme Court puts the legality of abortive procedures into the hands of the states which, for both those looking to avoid having a child and those working toward it, changes the way how people deal with fertility issues and really changes the way doctors practice medicine forever, Zhang said.                    Lucretia Torva of Phoenix never realized the procedure that once saved her life could be factored into discussions about abortion until the US Supreme Courts decision overturning Roe.                   She had gone to see the doctor for some pain, and she learned that not only was she pregnant, but that she was at risk of bleeding out and needed to go to the emergency room for surgery that night.        Why you should talk about sex with your partner after the SCOTUS decision on abortion               Torvas pregnancy was ectopic, meaning that the embryo implanted outside of the main cavity of her uterus. A fertilized egg cant survive an ectopic pregnancy and can result in life-threatening bleeding, according to the Mayo Clinic.                   Aborting the embryo is often the best treatment for an ectopic pregnancy, Zhang said.                    The end of Roe v. Wade abortion protection has many people concerned about access to treatments like those, as well as miscarriage treatment and in vitro fertilization, Tipton said.                    Sometimes, when a pregnant person miscarries, as in the case of Sharon McRae, doctors remove the tissue through D&C. In those cases, as well as following an abortion, the procedure helps prevent infection or excess bleeding, according to the Mayo Clinic.                    There is a lot of concern out there that things will be overread dealing with a follow-up from a miscarriage, Tipton said.                    And for people struggling to get pregnant, terminating embryos is a common part of in vitro fertilization, which is often described to patients as a numbers game, Zhang said.                   The expectant parents often have limited time and finances to go through the process, and so to ensure the highest rate of success, doctors will fertilize more eggs than needed in hopes of implanting the ones with the highest chances of developing into a full-term pregnancy, Zhang said. The rest are either saved for future use or discarded.                    Depending on how states define the legal status of a fertilized embryo, that process could become more complex, Zhang said.                    Dr. Mary Jacobson, a Palo-Alto, California-based OB-GYN and chief medical adviser at Alpha Medical calls the relationship between a doctor and patient sacrosanct.        What is medication abortion, and who has access to it?

CNNNews_12,"             The researchers analyzed data on deaths and other health outcomes using the most recent data available  from 2020 and earlier  and compared rates based on states current abortion access policies, as of November, after the Supreme Court decision this summer that overturned Roe v. Wade.        How outlawing abortion could worsen America's maternal mortality crisis               States that have restricted access to abortion services had maternal death rates in 2020 that were 62% higher than in states preserving access to abortion services. Between 2018 and 2020, the maternal death rate increased twice as fast in states that now have abortion restrictions, according to the report released Wednesday by the research foundation Commonwealth Fund.                    Overall, death rates from any cause among women of reproductive age  15 to 44  were 34% higher in abortion-restriction states than in abortion-access states, according to the report.                   The report also says that in 2019, fetal or infant death rates in the first week of life occurred at a 15% higher rate, on average, in states with abortion restrictions than in states with wider abortion access.                    Making reproductive services inaccessible to women and families can have dire consequences, and particularly, it varies by state, said obstetrician/gynecologist Dr. Laurie Zephyrin, a co-author of the report and senior vice president for advancing health equity at the Commonwealth Fund.                   In June the Supreme Court ruled on Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade, holding that there is no longer a federal constitutional right to an abortion and paving the way for states to ban abortions.                    Based on the findings in the report, Zephyrin thinks maternal death rates in the US could worsen after the Dobbs decision.                   More people in the US die from complications of pregnancy and childbirth than any other developed nation, and most are preventable  and our rates are on the rise, she said. So I think thats just very important as we think of this maternal health crisis and this collision of crises with this impact and this Dobbs decision.                   The new report  by researchers at Boston University and the Commonwealth Fund  includes data on state-by-state abortion policies and health outcomes among mothers and babies from sources including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Health Resources and Services Administration and the nonprofit March of Dimes.                    The researchers compared the health outcomes in 26 abortion-restricting states with those in the remaining 24 states and the District of Columbia, which appear to be unlikely to pass such restrictions.                   The researchers found that slightly more than half  55%  of US births in 2020 were in the 26 states currently with abortion bans or restrictions. In those states, births tended to be concentrated among women younger than 30, with 57% in women in that age group. In comparison, in abortion-access states, 45% of births were to women under 30.                    The analysis also revealed that 39% of counties in states restricting abortion access fit the criteria to be considered ??maternity care deserts,?? meaning there is limited or no access to maternity health care services, such as an ob/gyn, hospital or birth center with obstetric care or certified midwives. In comparison, 25% of counties in abortion-access states can be considered maternity care deserts.         36% of US counties are 'maternity care deserts,' raising risks for women and babies",4,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CNNNews_13,"             While many women obtain medication abortion from a clinic or their OB-GYN, others obtain the pills on their own to self-induce or self-manage their abortion, said Dr. Daniel Grossman, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Francisco.                   A growing body of research indicates that self-managed abortion is safe and effective, he said.        Some major pharmacies are planning to dispense abortion pills, but not in every state               Mifepristone blocks the hormone progesterone, which is needed for a pregnancy to continue. The drug is approved to end a pregnancy through 10 weeks gestation, which is 70 days or less since the first day of the last menstrual period, according to the FDA.                   In a medication abortion, a second drug, misoprostol, is taken within the next 24 to 48 hours. Misoprostol causes the uterus to contract, creating cramping and bleeding. Approved for use in other conditions, such as preventing stomach ulcers, the drug has been available at pharmacies for decades.                    Together, the two drugs are commonly known as the abortion pill, which is now used in more than half of the abortions in the United States, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.                   Some people do this because they cannot access a clinic  particularly in states with legal restrictions on abortion  or because they have a preference for self-care, said Grossman, who is also the director of Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, a research group that evaluates the pros and cons of reproductive health policies and publishes studies on how abortion affects a womans health.               What happens during a medication abortion? To find out, CNN spoke with Grossman. The conversation has been edited for clarity.        South Carolina's six-week abortion ban struck down by state Supreme Court   CNN: What is the difference between a first-trimester medication abortion and a vacuum aspiration in terms of what a woman experiences?   Dr. Daniel Grossman: A vacuum aspiration is most commonly performed under a combination of local anesthetic and oral pain medications or local anesthetic together with intravenous sedation, or what is called conscious sedation.                   An injection of local anesthetic is given to the area around the cervix, and the cervix is gently dilated or opened up. Once the cervix is opened, a small straw-like tube is inserted into the uterus, and a gentle vacuum is used to remove the pregnancy tissue. Contrary to what some say, if the procedure is done before nine weeks or so, theres nothing in the tissue that would be recognizable as a part of an embryo.                   The aspiration procedure takes just a couple of minutes; then the person is observed for one to two hours until any sedation has worn off. We also monitor each patient for very rare complications, such as heavy bleeding.        Grossman: A medication abortion is a more prolonged process. After taking the pills, bleeding and cramping can occur over a period of days. Bleeding is typically heaviest when the actual pregnancy is expelled, but that bleeding usually eases within a few hours. On average people continue to have some mild bleeding for about two weeks or so, which is a bit longer than after a vacuum aspiration.                   Nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, diarrhea and headache can occur after using the abortion pill, and everyone who has a successful medication abortion usually reports some pain.                    In fact, the pain of medication abortion can be quite intense. In the studies that have looked at it, the average maximum level of pain that people report is about a seven to eight out of 10, with 10 being the highest. However, people also say that the pain can be brief, peaking just as the pregnancy is being expelled.                   The level of cramping and pain can depend on the length of the pregnancy as well as whether or not someone has given birth before. For example, a medical abortion at six weeks or less gestation typically has less pain and cramping than one performed at nine weeks. People who have given birth generally have less pain.        CNN: What can be done to help with the pain of a medication abortion?   Grossman: There are definitely things that can be used to help with the pain. Research has shown that ibuprofen is better than acetaminophen for treating the pain of medication abortion. We typically advise people to take 600 milligrams every six hours or so as needed.                   Some people take tramadol, a narcotic analgesic, or Vicodin, which is a combination of acetaminophen and hydrocodone. Recent research I was involved in found medications like tramadol can be helpful if taken prophylactically before the pain starts.                    Another successful regimen that we studied combined ibuprofen with a nausea medicine called metoclopramide that also helped with pain. Other than ibuprofen, these medications require a prescription.        'Heartbreaking' stories go untold, doctors say, as employers 'muzzle' them in wake of abortion ruling               Another study found that a TENS device, which stands for transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator,  helps with the pain of medication abortion. It works through pads put on the abdomen that stimulate the nerves through mild electrical shocks, thus interfering with the pain signals. Thats something people could get without a prescription.                   Pain can be an overlooked issue with medication abortion because, quite honestly, as clinicians, were not there with patients when they are in their homes going through this. But as weve been doing more research on peoples experiences with medication abortion, its become quite clear that pain control is really important. I think we need to do a better job of treating the pain and making these options available to patients.        CNN: Are there health conditions that make the use of a medication abortion unwise?   Grossman: Undergoing a medication abortion can be dangerous if the pregnancy is ectopic, meaning the embryo is developing outside of the uterus. Its rare, happening in about two out of every 100 pregnancies  and it appears to be even rarer among people seeking medication abortion.        This conservative Christian couple in South Carolina have become outspoken advocates for abortion rights               People who have undergone previous pelvic, fallopian tube or abdominal surgery are at higher risk of an ectopic pregnancy, as are those with a history of pelvic inflammatory disease. Certain sexually transmitted infections can raise risk, as does smoking, a history of infertility and use of infertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization (IVF).                   If a person is on anticoagulant or blood thinning drugs or has a bleeding disorder, a medication abortion is not advised. The long-term use of st",3,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CNNNews_14,"             Tens of thousands of pregnancies have resulted from rape in states where abortion is not a legal option, researchers estimate in a new study.                   In the study, published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, researchers from Planned Parenthood, Resound Research for Reproductive Health and academic institutions across the US used a combination of federal surveys on crime and sexual violence to estimate that there were about 520,000 rapes that led to 64,565 pregnancies in the time since abortion bans have been enacted in 14 states  ranging by state from four to 18 months ago.       Related article Post-Roe, nearly 1 in 5 people seeking an abortion traveled out of state, analysis finds               Other research has found that there have been fewer than 10 abortions each month in states with bans, suggesting that most, if not all, victims were not able to get abortions in the states where they live, even those where the law allows exceptions for rape.                   Restricting abortion access to survivors of rape can have particularly devastating consequences, the medical journals editors wrote in a note about the new research. Whether these survivors of rape had illegal abortions, received medication abortion through the mail, traveled to other states, or carried the child to birth is unknown.                   About 1 in 5 adults in the US says that abortion should be legal in all cases, according to a 2022 survey from Pew Research Center. And a much larger majority  nearly 70% of adults  say abortion should be legal if pregnancy is the result of rape.                   But experts say  and the new research suggests  that the realities of putting those exceptions into practice are challenging.                   Like many exceptions written into abortion bans, an exception for rape victims may appear to be a reasonable solution but in practice can create more trauma and danger for patients who have already experienced a traumatic event, said Dr. Sami Heywood, an ob/gyn in Illinois and fellow with the advocacy group Physicians for Reproductive Health who was not involved in the new research.                   No other health care is reserved only for people who can prove a crime took place. Thats?not an ethical way to practice medicine. It is cruel to force people who have already been victimized to jump through legal and logistical barriers that cause further harm.       Related article Births have increased in states with abortion bans, research finds               Health care providers may not always ask the question, and victims may not want to disclose this history, but even those who do may face additional challenges, experts say.                   ??Those who become pregnant after rape may take longer to recognize a pregnancy than other pregnant people, and there may be factors related to the trauma response that accounts for this,?? said Dr. Rachel Perry, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, Irvine.                   This delay may mean medication abortion ?C which may be used up to 10 weeks gestation ?C is not an option, and victims may have to travel particularly long distances to a provider, said Perry, who was not involved in the new study.                   Also, rape victims often know their assaulter and may live with them.                   ??It may be especially impossible for them to travel out of state to get abortion care.

CNNNews_15,"             Deborah Dorberts son Milo died in her arms on March 3, shortly after he was born, just as her doctors had predicted he would.                     He gasped for air a couple of times when I held him, said Dorbert, 33. I watched my child take his first breath, and I held him as he took his last one.                     She said her pregnancy was proceeding normally until November, when, at 24 weeks, an ultrasound showed that the fetus did not have kidneys and that she had hardly any amniotic fluid. Not only was the baby sure to die, her doctors told her, but the pregnancy put her at especially high risk of preeclampsia, a potentially deadly complication.                     Her doctors told her it was too late to terminate the pregnancy in Florida, which bans nearly all abortions after 15 weeks. The only options were to go out of state/to get an abortion or to carry the baby to full term, and Dorbert and her husband didnt have the money to travel.                    What followed was an agonizing 13 weeks of carrying a baby she knew would die and worrying about her own health. It left Dorbert with severe anxiety and depression for the first time in her life.         Florida law allows abortions after 15 weeks if two doctors confirm the diagnosis of a fatal fetal abnormality in writing, but doctors in Florida and states with similar laws have been hesitant to terminate such pregnancies for fear someone will question whether the abnormality was truly fatal. The penalties for violating the law are severe: Doctors can go to prison and face heavy fines and legal fees.         Interactive: A lonely struggle: Nine mothers share the mental health challenges they faced during the happiest time of their lives              CNN reached out to Florida state Reps. Erin Grall and Jenna Persons-Mulicka, who co-sponsored the states 15-week ban, for comment on Dorberts situation.                   Grall did not respond. Persons-Mulicka sent a statement.                     The intent of the law is quite clear. We are providing mothers with the resources they need to raise healthy children, empowering doctors to help their patients make informed decisions, and shifting the conversation to valuing life, she wrote.                    Last month, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into/law/an even more restrictive measure that would ban most abortions in the state after six weeks, with an exception for fatal fetal abnormalities./The law wont go into effect until the state Supreme Court overturns its precedent on abortion or tosses out a case challenging state abortion restrictions.                    Deborah met Lee in 2014 while they were working at Publix in Lakeland, Florida, where she was a clerk and he was a team leader in the grocery department. They married three years later, and their son Kaiden was born a year after that.                     Last year, the couple was thrilled when they found out they were going to have a second child. On the day before Thanksgiving, when she was 23 weeks pregnant, Dorbert brought Kaiden to an ultrasound appointment.          Texas sued by women who say state's abortion bans put their health at risk               The 4-year-old was enthralled, looking at the screen and following along with the ultrasound technician as she pointed out the babys features.                     Hed go, yeah, theres the eye or theres the hand,  Dorbert remembered. He was excited that he could see the baby on the monitor.                     But abruptly, the technician stopped pointing at the screen and left the room to get the obstetrician.                     Her obstetricians ultrasound report that day shows a grim diagnosis: There was no right kidney, and it was unclear whether there was a left kidney. In addition, the baby had too little amniotic fluid, and the heart was swollen. The obstetrician referred Dorbert to a high-risk pregnancy expert.                     Because of the holiday, it took a week before the Dorberts could get in to see the specialist. They said a more detailed ultrasound at that appointment showed that the baby had no kidneys at all and that the lungs were under-developed.                     The condition is called Potter syndrome, and the specialist said it was  incompatible with life,  Deborah remembers. She says the doctor told her the baby would be stillborn or would die within minutes, or at most hours, after birth.                     In this situation, doctors in states that allow abortions routinely give parents two options, according to Dr. Erika Werner, chair of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Tufts Medical Center and a spokesperson for the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine.          Ohio abortion law meant weeks of 'anguish,' 'agony' for couple whose unborn child had organs outside her body                One is to induce birth and, if the baby is born alive, offer comfort care until death. The other is to carry the baby to full term.                     The Dorberts told the specialist that they wanted to induce birth, terminating the pregnancy, to spare the baby, themselves and their older son from suffering. They said the doctor agreed that this was a sound decision.                     Dorbert says the doctor told her that in all the cases hed seen, that was always the outcome  someones baby went stillborn  and the ones that did deliver, the babies pass shortly after birth.                     But the doctor said he would need to check with his administration because of the Florida law that had gone into effect a few months before, banning most abortions after 15 weeks.                     The law makes an exception if two physicians certify in writing that, in reasonable medical judgment, the fetus has a fatal fetal abnormality, which the law defines as a terminal condition that, in reasonable medical judgment, regardless of the provision of life-saving medical treatment, is incompatible with life outside the womb and will result in death upon birth or imminently thereafter.                     About a month passed without a decision. Finally, Dorberts obstetrician informed her that she wouldnt terminate the pregnancy. By this point, Dorbert was 27 weeks along.                     Dr. Stephanie Ros, a high-risk pregnancy expert in Tampa and a spokesperson for the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, said shes not surprised that the doctor was unwilling to do the termination, considering that the law does not spell out exactly what would be considered a terminal condition.                    With health care, there are very few black-and-whites. There are so many things that are a little bit nuanced, she said. The moment the law came out, I think everyone was scrambling to try to figure out what exactly that language intended to convey.                    If a doctor is convicted of running afoul of the law, the penalties are severe: up to five years in prison and $5,000 in fines, not to mention steep legal fees.                     Ros, an associate professor at the University of South Florida, said that after the law was passed, she and colleagues at Florida academic medical centers wrote a list of conditions they considered fatal fetal abnormalities. Renal agenesis  the absence of kidneys  was on the list.                     For that reason, she said, she would feel comfortable terminating a pregnancy with a fetus with this condition, but she absolutely understands why doctors who arent at academic medical centers, such as Dorberts obstetrician, would refuse.                     Its tricky because of how this law was written in the first place, she said.                     In Dorberts situation, part of that trickiness has to do with the pregnancy 10 years ago of a woman shes never met.                     In 2012, Jaime Herrera Beutler, then a Republican US congresswoman from Washington state, found out she was pregnant with a baby who, like Dorberts, had Potter syndrome. The condition affects more than just the kidneys. Functioning kidneys produce amniotic fluid, which a fetus breathes into their lungs, and if theres not enough of it, the lungs dont develop properly.          How Rep. Herrera Beutler saved her baby               In the womb, the baby can live with underdeveloped lungs because the placenta provides oxygen. But after birth, the baby is on their own.                     During her pregnancy, Herrera Beutler and her husband, Dan, heard the babys heartbeat on an ultrasound.                     Thats pretty convincing. We know shes still alive, Dan Beutler told CNN in 2017. We had this gut feeling of there has to be something.                      The couple sought out an experimental treatment at Johns Hopkins Medicine in which doctors transfused saline solution into the uterus to help mimic amniotic fluid. After a series of weekly infusions, their daughter, Abigail, was born 12 weeks prematurely. She survived on dialysis until she was big enough for a kidney transplant from her father.                    In a 2019 essay in the Wall Street Journal, Herrera Beutler wrote that Abigail was a healthy, happy big sister.                     Through divine intervention and some courageous doctors we now have Abigail in our lives, she wrote.                     Herrera Beutler, now a strategic adviser to the Childrens Hospital Association, did not respond to requests for comment on this story.                     Abigails parents have said she is the first baby without kidneys to survive childbirth. A 2014 Hopkins news release called Abigails survival a medical marvel.                     In 2017, Hopkins and several other academic medical centers started a clinical trial to see how well the saline treatment worked.                     In the study, 18 pregnant women whose fetuses did not have kidneys received uterine saline infusions. They went to the researchers one to three times a week, and each time, the doctors inserted a needle into their uterus for the procedure, which could take up to an hour. They made these visits for about 11 weeks.          This conservative Christian couple in South Carolina have become outspoken advocates for abortion rights               Four of those 18 children are still alive, according to Dr. Jena Miller, an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Center for Fetal Therapy and co-principal investigator of the study.                     One baby was stillborn, and the other 17 were born prematurely and alive. Of those 17 babies, 14 survived to 2 weeks of age. Over the next two years, eight of those 14 children died without ever leaving the hospital.                     The remaining six babies spent an average of about six months in the hospital and then went home. Two later died; the other four are on dialysis. None has received a kidney transplant.                     Miller presented preliminary results from the study at a February meeting of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine. The research has not been peer-reviewed or published in a professional journal.                     She noted that in the study, even when babies did survive, they are medically complex and have required multiple surgeries.                     Youre subjecting parents to a very medically complex child, and for some families, theyre happy. Theyre OK with doing that, she said. The family that chooses that, theyre all in for that. But its their choice to make. There are absolutely families that just do not have the resources or the capacity for that journey. They would not choose that journey for themselves or their child.                     By the time the Dorberts got the news that her doctors wouldnt terminate Deborahs pregnancy, she was 27 weeks along.                   As the baby grew, Dorbert started having terrible pain in her ribs and back, much worse than anything shed experienced during her pregnancy with Kaiden. She says her obstetrician explained that without cushioning from the amniotic fluid, the baby had a more direct impact on her body.                     Dorbert says they didnt have the money to travel out of state to get an abortion. By this time, they??d left their jobs at Publix; she was doing Instacart deliveries, and Lee was working at an insurance company.                     A few weeks later, at 31 weeks pregnant, she had a regular visit ",7,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I dont apologize for it, Pence told the AP in a recent interview. I just have heard so many stories over the years of courageous women and families who were told that their unborn child would not go to term or would not survive. And then they had a healthy pregnancy and a healthy delivery.                   A Pence adviser told CNN that the former vice presidents position still allows for exceptions for life of the mother.                   Pence strongly opposes abortion and has been perhaps the most outspoken Republican candidate about the issue as many of his GOP rivals have avoided staking out a clear position on abortion.                   During a CNN town hall in Iowa last month, Pence said he supports a federal abortion ban including exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother. He also backs federal legislation limiting the procedure and has called on other 2024 GOP candidates to support a 15-week national abortion ban.

CNNNews_17,"             The evolving patchwork of access to abortion care is going through big changes this week, with the entire Southeast on the brink of imposing new limits.                    Bands of states restricting abortion access could soon extend the entire length of the country, depending on legislative action and pending court battles.                   ? Republican lawmakers in North Carolina overrode their Democratic governors veto, moving to ban most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy. Under current state law, abortions are legal up to 20 weeks of pregnancy.                    The new law, which takes effect July 1, also imposes new requirements for medication abortion, which now accounts for the vast majority of US abortions and is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to be conducted up to 10 weeks of pregnancy.                   North Carolina Republicans got the supermajority they needed when a Democrat who had previously supported abortion rights, state Rep. Tricia Cotham, changed parties.                   ? In South Carolina, a total abortion ban was blocked earlier this year by a bloc of female lawmakers, including several Republicans. But this week, the legislature is on pace to restrict abortion after six weeks.                    The bill is known as the Fetal Heartbeat and Protection from Abortion Act, and would ban most abortions after early cardiac activity can be detected in a fetus or embryo. Such activity can commonly be detected as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant, according to CNNs report.        Why this South Carolina Republican blocked her state's near-total abortion ban               South Carolina state Sen. Penry Gustafson, who helped defeat the total abortion ban, told CNNs Christiane Amanpour this month that she considers herself to be pro-life, but that neither she nor most South Carolinians support a total ban.                   The Republican consensus is that we do need restrictions, Gustafson said. Theres a range of that between zero weeks and 12 weeks. She supports a six-week ban in South Carolina and opposes a federal abortion ban.                    ? In Nebraskas unicameral and nonpartisan legislature, after lawmakers earlier this year failed to impose a six-week ban, they voted this week to include a 12-week abortion ban in a bill to ban transgender health care for minors.                   ? Nationally, the legality of medication abortion has been challenged and an appeals court hearing Wednesday in New Orleans will set the stage for how the case is ultimately brought to the Supreme Court, which has kept the drug mifepristone available for now.       RELATED: See where abortions are banned and legal ?? and where it??s still in limbo               The actions in the Carolinas ?C assuming the six-week ban ultimately passes in South Carolina ?C mean that the entire Southeast, from North Carolina over to Oklahoma, and from Florida east to Texas, will have restricted access to abortion care far beyond what was available under Roe v. Wade.                   The restrictions continue to the north in Kentucky, where voters last November rejected placing anti-abortion rights language in the state??s constitution, but legislators have so far left in place a near-total abortion ban during an ensuing court fight.

CNNNews_18,"             The woman will see the first image of the baby growing inside of her  one she will never hold.                    The ultrasound doesnt take long, and the image is unmistakable.                    You can see the head and the little nose, says the woman, pointing at the ultrasound picture. She asks the doctor if she can keep the image. I want the picture because although I am deciding and taking this option, I still wanted to see my little baby, she says.                    That option is an abortion.                   She will have the termination at the Planned Parenthood clinic in Tucson, Arizona, where she was just examined. First, there is a state-mandated 24-hour wait.                   As she sits, ultrasound picture in her hand, she chooses to tell her story to CNN.                   I want to make peace with this, she says, grieving for the child who will never be born.                    Her decision has nothing to do with politics. But caught up in all the emotions roiling through her is her reaction to the national political debate about reproductive rights and who should decide what is best.                   I am very angry. Very, she emphasizes. All I see is a group of people  men, mostly  making a decision for all of us women when they have not one idea what it is like to be in our shoes.        These male politicians are pushing for women who receive abortions to be punished with prison time               She spoke to CNN just days before a Pima County judge ruled Friday that a ban from 1901, before Arizona was even a state, should be allowed to come into force. The 121-year-old law, which allows abortion only to save the life of the mother, is one of the measures coming back into effect since this summers Dobbs decision by the US Supreme Court overturning Roe vs. Wade.                   The woman, whose identity CNN is withholding for her privacy and her safety, says she may not show you her face, but she wants you to hear her story.                    If we speak up more, maybe our voices will be heard. Just maybe.                   The woman in the clinic is 23 and lives with her partner and their two young sons.                   Her first pregnancy was physically challenging, from dehydration to extreme abdominal pain.                    But she says the second pregnancy nearly killed her.                    I was screaming in pain, the woman recalls of carrying her younger child, her voice breaking into a sob as she explains rushing to the hospital when she was five months pregnant. They werent sure if my placenta was abrupting. I had IVs hooked up to me, breathing machines.                   The doctors ran multiple tests, she explains, but they couldnt understand why she was bleeding and continuing to have contractions.                What then? I keep this baby and I lose my life? And I cant be there for my other two sons?                   The woman, considering what could happen without an abortion                       One time, she was in the hospital for 23 days. One moment during that stay continues to haunt her.                     Paperwork, she remembers, to sign to decide whether I save my life or my sons life.                    She wanted the comfort of her partner or her mother, but her second pregnancy was during the height of the coronavirus pandemic and hospital protocols meant she was utterly alone.                    At 37 weeks, Im in the hospital, bleeding, scared and alone, without my mother, without my family because of Covid. Im getting ready to have a premature baby. He makes it. He comes out alive, thank God, she recalls, tears streaming down her face.         Ohio's new abortion law forces doctor to fight to protect her patient's life                Her second child feels like a miracle  healthy despite the physical difficulty of the pregnancy. And they are a family, two working parents raising their babies.                   About 10 weeks ago, the birth control failed between the woman and her partner.                    A few weeks later, an at-home test showed she was pregnant.                   If things were different, she might have chosen to add to her family, she says. If this baby didnt come with all the complications and everything that it does, then yes, she says.                   But the overwhelming thought was the moment the last time when faced with the paperwork about whose life takes precedence in an emergency.                   ??What then? I keep this baby and I lose my life? And I can??t be there for my other two sons??? she recalls thinking.                   She called Planned Parenthood in Tucson, but it was closed.                    A new law was set to come into effect with a 15-week restriction on abortions in Arizona but with the state??s attorney general calling for the reinstatement of the 1901 ban, abortion services were halted amid widespread confusion, leaving women caught in the middle.

CNNNews_19,"             They were adamant that a woman who receives an abortion should receive the same criminal consequences as one who drowns her baby.                   Under a bill they promoted, pregnant people could face murder charges even if they were raped or doctors determined the procedure was needed to save their own life. Doctors who attempted to help patients conceive through in-vitro fertilization, a fertility treatment used by millions of Americans, could also be locked up for destroying embryos, and certain contraception such as Plan B would be banned.                    The taking of a life is murder, and it is illegal, state Rep. Danny McCormick told a committee of state lawmakers who considered the bill in May, right after the Supreme Courts decision to overturn Roe v. Wade was leaked.                   No compromises, no more waiting, Brian Gunter, the pastor who suggested McCormick be the one to introduce the legislation, told the committee.                    Only four people spoke against the bill during the committee meeting all women. They pleaded with the lawmakers to grasp the gravity of the proposed restrictions, which went farther than any state abortion law currently on the books, and warned of unintended consequences.                   We need to take a deep breath, said Melissa Flournoy, a former state representative who runs the progressive advocacy group 10,000 Women Louisiana. She said the bill would only punish women and that there wasnt enough responsibility being placed on men.                    But in the end, only one man and one woman, an Independent and a Democrat, voted against it in committee. Seven men on the committee, all Republicans, voted in favor of the bill, moving it one step closer to becoming law.                    A faction of self-proclaimed abolitionists are seeking to make abortion laws more restrictive and the consequences of having the procedure more punitive than ever before.                    Emboldened by the overturning of Roe v. Wade, they say they will not be satisfied until fetuses are given the same protections as all US citizens  meaning that if abortion is illegal, then criminal statutes should be applied accordingly. While major national anti-abortion groups say they do not support criminalizing women, the idea is gaining traction with certain conservative lawmakers. And the activists and politicians leading the charge are nearly always men, CNN found.       What should we investigate next?  Email us: watchdog@cnn.com.               This year, three male lawmakers from Indiana attempted to wipe out existing abortion regulations and change the states criminal statutes to apply at the time of fertilization. In Texas, five male lawmakers authored a bill last year that would have made getting an abortion punishable by the death penalty if it had gone into law. A state representative in Arizona introduced legislation that included homicide charges  saying in a Facebook video that anyone who undergoes an abortion deserves to spend some time in the Arizona penal system. And a male Kansas lawmaker proposed a bill that would amend the states constitution to allow abortion laws to pass without an exception for the life of the mother.                     While most in the anti-abortion movement believe that human life begins at conception, abolitionists are particularly uncompromising in how they act on their beliefs  comparing abortion to the Holocaust and using inflammatory terms such as slaughter and murder to describe a medical procedure that most Americans believe should be legal in all or most cases.               Bradley Pierce, the attorney who helped draft the Louisiana bill, said his organization has been involved with many of the abolition bills that have been introduced in more than a dozen states. All of this proposed legislation would make it possible for women seeking abortions to face criminal charges.                    An overwhelming majority of Americans said in a Pew Research Center poll they dont believe men should have a greater say on abortion policy, but that is what is happening. Experts told CNN that the male dominance fits within the anti-abortion movements current framing as being focused on fetal personhood and fetal rights as opposed to maternal rights.                   Eric Swank, an Arizona State University professor who has studied gender differences in anti-abortion activists, said his research found that while men arent necessarily more likely to consider themselves to be pro-life than women, they are more willing to take the adamant stance of no abortion under any conditions.                   The most restrictive bills, which dont include explicit life of the mother exceptions and would charge those who receive abortions with homicide, have failed to make it to the full vote needed for passage. But others that prohibit abortions even in cases of rape and incest have taken hold in around a dozen states, including Missouri, Alabama and Tennessee, according to Guttmacher Institute.     Republicans have unlikely allies in their fight to restrict abortion at the state level: Democrats                Those laws, CNN found, were also overwhelmingly passed into law by male legislators. While female Republicans almost always voted in favor of the legislation, gender imbalances within state legislatures, as well as the fact that female lawmakers were more likely to be Democrats, fueled the voting gap. And male Democratic lawmakers were far more likely than female Democrats to cross the aisle to vote in favor of the abortion bans, according to CNNs analysis.                The Texas Heartbeat Act, for example, outlawed nearly all abortions in the state when it criminalized the procedure as soon as a heartbeat could be detected  as early as six weeks of pregnancy. While men made up nearly three quarters of the 177 lawmakers who voted, nearly 90% of those who voted in favor of the bill were men.                    Scott Herndon, a bearded Idaho man and father of eight, once believed abortion was an issue that should be discussed between a woman and her physician.                    He remembers watching the classic 80s movie, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, and being relatively ambivalent about the fact that one of the characters received an abortion. He didnt become a Christian until 1996, the same year he drove his pregnant girlfriend along the streets of San Francisco on his motorcycle. The pregnancy was unexpected, but that life development, along with a newfound religious practice, led Herndon to spend a lot of thinking about the miraculous nature of life. Over the years he began to feel compelled to get involved with the anti-abortion movement.                   His daughter is now 25, and he and his wife went on to have seven more children. A longtime member of the Idaho Republicans, he told CNN he decided to run for state Senate this year with a mission of fighting government encroachment. Herndon, who touts his competitive shooting experience in high school and college, is a staunch supporter of the right to bear arms and strongly opposes vaccine mandates. He describes himself as a true family-values conservative, noting that his sons help him with his home-building business while his five daughters live on the family farm, milking cows, and raising chickens and pigs.                   One of his longterm goals if elected, he said, is to abolish abortion in the state.                   Success depends on changing hearts and minds, he said. I liken the effort to Martin Luther King Jr.s civil rights movement for desegregation and equal treatment of African Americans.                   This comparison is one that abortion rights activists take serious issue with. Lets be clear: appropriating the word abolition is particularly contemptuous, a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Federation of America said in a statement to CNN. That word is a symbol of freedom and this group wants to put people behind bars for exercising their right to bodily autonomy.                    Herndon, however, says women should embrace their instinctual sacrificial behavior.                    If a mother is in a life raft with a child and theres only enough food and water to save one, Im guessing most mothers would not throw their child overboard and drown them, he said in an interview with CNN when asked about medical circumstances where a doctor may deem an abortion necessary to save a womans life, such as a cancer diagnosis that requires aggressive treatment.                    As part of their efforts to abolish abortion, which is generally defined as the termination of a pregnancy, Herndon and others in the anti-abortion movement are attempting to redefine the term to the intentional killing of a fetus.                    That way, they claim, the lives of mothers could still be saved as long as doctors make an equal attempt to save the fetus.                    Gunter, meanwhile, said he disagrees with the medical establishment and does not believe abortion is ever medically necessary.                    Medical and legal experts told CNN this is a dangerous and inaccurate claim, saying there are plenty of situations that could result in women dying or being put through unnecessary bodily harm if explicit exceptions for the health and life of the mother are not included in the laws regulating abortion.                    Louise King, a gynecologic surgeon and professor at Harvard Medical School, said the claims are disingenuous at best and intentional dissemination of misinformation at worst and questioned why they cant simply trust medical professionals to do their job.                   Most of these arguments are attempts to impose a minority religious view on the majority of our citizens, she said. This is not a matter of belief or opinion. This is a highly inappropriate way to use our legislative system.         Conservatives have pushed infant safe haven laws as an alternative to abortion. But few American women use them               An immediate abortion may be needed if a pregnant persons water breaks before 20 weeks, King said, or when patients have pre-existing conditions that could lead to heart or liver failure or they need aggressive treatment for a disease like cancer that would severely harm  if not destroy  the fetus. An equal attempt to save the fetus would require putting the life of the pregnant person at risk, she said, adding that it is also not the well established standard of care.                    Doctors also note that abortion bans take away a patients ability to make decisions about their own health and pregnancy, sometimes forcing them to endure pregnancies and deliveries of fetuses that will not survive.                    Stories like this are already making headlines as laws become increasingly restrictive.  In some cases, doctors are already afraid to perform abortions in cases where a mothers health is at risk, even with so called life of the mother exceptions in place. In Texas, one woman learned that her baby had heart, lung, brain, kidney and genetic defects and would either be stillborn or die within minutes of birth. At the same time, doctors warned her that carrying the baby to term threatened her own life, but she says she was still refused an abortion by doctors who said it could run afoul of the states strict six-week abortion ban. She ultimately drove 10 hours to a New Mexico abortion clinic to undergo the procedure. Im still so angry and hurt about it that I can hardly see straight, she wrote on Facebook the next day.                    Another Texas woman spoke out about being forced to carry her dead fetus for weeks after suffering a miscarriage. In Louisiana, a woman carrying a fetus without a skull was reportedly not allowed to get an abortion, while another was reportedly denied an abortion and instead forced into hours of labor when her water broke at 16 weeks, long before the fetus was viable.                     Herndon agreed that the health of the pregnant woman should be considered, but he worries that the medical community automatically prioritizes the mothers life and does not treat the fetus as a person until birth, saying this needs to change. And he said that while locking up women is not his objective, it only makes sense for homicide charges to apply to a woman who chooses to undergo an abortion if fetuses are given equal protections under the law.                     As chair of his countys Republican Party, he attended the Idaho Republican convention in July and proposed an official change to the party platform in support of an amendment to the state constitution that would strengthen the rights of fetuses.                    After it easily passed the vote, a fellow Republican delegate took the floor with a proposal that was not met with the same support. She wanted to make sure an exception was included in the party platform for abortions needed for a womans physical and mental health, Herndon recounted.                   A heated debate ensued, with Herndon describing the proposal as not carefully crafted and unnecessary. The proposal was ultimately rejected by a margin of nearly 3 to 1, according to news reports. The Idaho Republican Party did not respond to requests for comment.                    Back in 2019, a bill that would criminalize abortion even in cases of rape and incest was placed in front of Alabama??s legislature ?? a move so extreme that a number of high-profile Republicans initially said it went too far.                     When the bill reached the state Senate, 25 male legislators voted on party lines to enact it, and the state??s female governor signed it into law.                    A federal judge blocked it from taking effect, but it had an immediate domino effect as other states followed suit. Most of the laws, including near-total abortion bans known as ??trigger?? laws and six-week ??heartbeat?? bills, weren??t able to take effect at the time either, but they are being implemented across the country now that Roe v. Wade has been overturne",6,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CNNNews_20,"             In December 2018, Marshae Jones of Alabama was shot in the stomach while she was five months pregnant. She survived, but the fetus she was carrying did not.                    The woman who shot Jones claimed she was acting in self-defense and wasnt prosecuted. Jones, on the other hand, was indicted by a grand jury on a manslaughter charge that shed intentionally caused the death of her unborn baby.                    The charges, for which Jones could have served up to 20 years in prison if convicted, were dropped following a huge public outcry in a case that illustrates the real legal jeopardy women could find themselves in if the rights of their unborn children are given precedence over their own.                    Fetal personhood  a movement advocating that fetuses should have the same legal protections as people  is inexorably linked to the prosecution of pregnant women. If a fetus can be regarded as a homicide victim under personhood laws, its rights can supersede those of the living, breathing person carrying it.                   When the Supreme Court established a constitutional right to abortion in the landmark Roe v. Wade decision in 1973, it rejected the concept of fetal personhood, recognizing that fetuses have never been given full legal rights under the Constitution.                      The unborn have never been recognized in the law as persons in the whole sense, the justices wrote in their opinion.                     If Roe is overturned, a number of states have trigger laws in place that will almost immediately make abortion illegal. The broad drafting of some abortion trigger laws defines the start of pregnancy as the moment of fertilization, thereby encompassing not only fetuses but also embryos and even fertilized eggs. This degree of protection, persistently advocated for by the personhood movement, creates a legal quagmire with potentially terrifying ramifications.        Criminalizing abortion opens the door for people to be charged with murder or manslaughter for miscarriages over which they have no control. Since Roe, there have been hundreds of instances in which a womans pregnancy has been a decisive factor in attempted and actual deprivations of her physical liberty.         Court cases of past years offer a glimpse of how vulnerable pregnant people are to legal action.         Jennifer Jorgensen of New York was convicted of manslaughter for what prosecutors claimed was reckless behavior after she was involved in a car crash in 2008. Jorgensen, who was eight months pregnant at the time, had to get an emergency cesarean section, but her baby died six days later. She reportedly hadnt been wearing a seatbelt, but prosecutors also alleged that she was high on drugs and alcohol at the time, and that this behavior led to the death not only of two people, Robert and Mary Kelly, but also her baby. Jorgensen was cleared on all counts, except the manslaughter charge arising from the death of her child.                    The manslaughter conviction was later overturned, but only because a judge ruled that state legislators didnt intend to hold pregnant women criminally responsible for conduct with respect to themselves and their unborn fetuses unless such conduct is done intentionally.                      In 2021, Brittney Poolaw was sentenced to four years in prison for first-degree manslaughter following a miscarriage, after she admitted to hospital staff that she had used illegal drugs while pregnant.                   Prosecutors couldnt prove that substance abuse caused Poolaws miscarriage. A medical examiner testified that a number of conditions, including congenital abnormalities, might have triggered it. Her attorney has since filed a notice of intent to appeal  a significant risk, since by appealing her conviction, she risks being reconvicted, and possibly receiving the maximum life sentence for manslaughter.                    Fetal homicide laws meanwhile, which exist in roughly three dozen states, originated as a means of punishing those who harm pregnant women. They have swiftly evolved however into instruments to prosecute women. And as these laws become more entrenched, precedent builds upon precedent: Allowing for the possibility of fetal homicide broadens the potential to legally punish pregnant women for any harm that comes to their fetus.                     When feticide laws are used against mothers, the prosecutions often involve alleged drug use, but they have the potential to be used in a wide range of scenarios when prosecutors believe that a fetus might have been endangered.                     In 2008, a man in Indiana shot Katherin Shuffield, a bank teller pregnant with twins, during a robbery. Shuffield survived, but her twins did not, and the man was charged with two counts of feticide. He was convicted and sentenced to 53 years in prison.                   Indiana??s feticide law was later applied to a 2010 case involving a woman named Bei Bei Shuai who tried to kill herself while she was eight months pregnant. She lived, but her baby was born and then died a few days later. Shuai was charged with murder and attempted feticide. The charges against her were droppe",5,,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CNNNews_22," What is medication abortion?               Medication abortion, also known as medical abortion, is a method by which someone ends their pregnancy by taking two pills, rather than having a surgical procedure.                    The first pill is mifepristone, sold under the brand names Mifeprex or Korlym. Its also known as RU 486. The second pill is called misoprostol.        The battle over medication abortion is the warm-up fight as the Supreme Court weighs gutting Roe   How does it work?               Mifepristone blocks a hormone called progesterone, which the body needs for the pregnancy to continue. The hormone helps maintain the inside of the uterus. When the hormone is absent, the uterus will expel its contents.                   After taking mifepristone, the patient waits 24 to 48 hours to take misoprostol. That helps empty the uterus through bleeding and muscle contractions.                   The drugs typically cause intense cramps and heavy bleeding for about 3 to 5 hours. A regular menstrual period will usually resume in a couple of weeks.                   Within 14 days of taking the medicine, the patient will go back to a health clinic or doctors office for a follow-up appointment. A health care professional will do a lab test or an ultrasound to confirm that the abortion is complete. They will also check the patient for infection.        When can you have a medication abortion?               The drugs can be taken immediately after someone learns that theyre pregnant, up to 10 weeks after the first day of the last menstrual period.        What abortion access looks like in America even before the Supreme Court reconsiders Roe v. Wade   Can you get pregnant again after having it?               Yes, but a person who takes these drugs needs to use a birth control for at least a month afterward.       When was the process approved?               The FDA approved mifepristone, coupled with misoprostol, for abortion use in 2000. This combination is also available in more than 60 other countries.                   In 2016, the FDA approved a supplemental application from the maker of Mifeprex to change the regimen and the drug label.    Who shouldnt take the drugs?               Medication abortion medicines shouldnt be taken 70 or more days after the start of the last menstrual period.                    People who have certain health conditions or who have had an ectopic pregnancy, a rare event in which the fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, shouldnt have a medication abortion.                    It??s not recommended for people who have an intrauterine device (IUD) for birth control, although it can be removed before the medication abortion. People on long-term systemic corticosteroid therapy and those who are allergic to the drugs or similar medications also shouldn??t use them.                   People with anemia can take the drugs, but they may need more monitoring because of the bleeding that happens.       How many people use this method?               An increasing number of people have had medication abortions since its approval. A 2017 study from the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights think tank, found that an estimated 60% of people chose this method.                   A 2018 study from the Kaiser Family Foundation had a similar finding, noting that 54% of abortions before nine weeks of gestation were done through medication.

CNNNews_23,"             Earlier this month, a British woman who used medication to terminate a pregnancy after the UKs legally allowed limit was sentenced to 28 months in prison under Victorian-era legislation, in a case that has sparked calls for an overhaul of reproductive justice laws in the country. The woman, who has three children, will serve 14 months in custody and the remainder on license after her release.          How has your life changed since the Roe v. Wade reversal?               One year after the US Supreme Court struck down Roe v Wade and reignited a worldwide protest movement against restricting abortion access, pro-choice advocates in the UK say little progress has been made to increase access to reproductive health services.                     Its just ridiculous that the state, the government, keeps just involving themselves like in birthing peoples rights to choose abortion, Nadia Hirsi, a 23-year-old actress and theater maker based in London, told CNN as she attended the protest in central London.                    Jennifer Dean, a London-based blogger in their 50s, who was also at the protest, said: Our body, our choice means as much to the trans community as it does to cisgender women & I dont have a womb. But, you know, it should be whoever has a womb should have the choice what they do with it.                    Jenny Wickham, a 75-year-old pro-choice campaigner who has been demonstrating since the 1960s, told CNN: The liberalization of abortion law is under threat like never before.                   Abortion is currently legal in the UK up to the first 24 weeks of pregnancy. After this threshold, women found to have administered drugs to terminate a pregnancy are liable to receive a prison sentence up to a life term.                     In the recent headline-making case, the mother-of-three, 44, was handed her 28-month sentence by a judge in Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court in central England under the Offences Against the Person Act, which dates back to 1861. The woman was between 32 and 34 weeks pregnant at the time she took the medication, the court heard.                    Barrister Charlotte Proudman called the act itself ancient in an interview with CNN, highlighting that it was written at a time when women didnt even have the right to vote in the UK.                     Proudman was one of more than 60 signatories of a letter addressed to the Director of Public Prosecutions for England and Wales last summer which highlighted the cases of two women who at the time faced prosecution for terminating a pregnancy.                     She feels disappointed that little change has been enacted since the letter, saying there is real fear that this landmark conviction may result in further convictions.                     In the past decade, 67 prosecutions have taken place in England and Wales under the same legislation, opposition lawmaker Stella Creasy told the UK parliament on June 15.                     Proudman has observed a collective outrage and anger at the recent conviction, especially at the fact that [the woman] could even be prosecuted for this type of crime.                     I think, you know, people generally have been fairly shocked as well that abortion-related offenses still exist on the statute books,?? she added.                     Proudman said the decision of the US Supreme Court last year to overturn the landmark Roe v Wade ruling had made her reflect on the state of abortion laws in the UK.                     ??I was now thinking, well hang on a minute ?? look at what??s happening closer to home. England, Wales, Scotland and the fact that abortion still remains a criminal offense subject to certain exceptions,?? she said.                     In 2019, lawmakers in the British parliament voted for legislation which ended the criminalization of abortion in Northern Ireland, essentially placing its laws at odds with the rest of the UK.                     Charity campaigners like Katherine O??Brien of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) said they are now making what she called a ??straightforward?? argument for the extension of this legislation to the rest of the UK.

CNNNews_24," Medication abortion, also known as medical abortion, is a method by which someone ends their pregnancy by taking two pills, rather than having a surgical procedure. The first pill is mifepristone, sold under the brand names Mifeprex (formerly RU 486) or Korlym. The second pill is misoprostol.    Medication abortion now accounts for more than half of all US abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on sexual and reproductive health.        Opinion: The conflicts in a post-Roe America are just beginning               When mifepristone was approved by the FDA in 2000, it was restricted for use only to end a pregnancy 10 weeks or less after the first day of the persons last menstrual period.                    The FDA told Politico that it was concerned that providers who gave medication for an abortion before they were pregnant wouldnt be able to properly oversee their patients care, including telling how far along the pregnancy is or whether its inside the uterus (intrauterine) or outside the uterus (ectopic). Mifepristones labeling says it should not be used in cases of ectopic pregnancy.                   The FDA did not have a direct response to the report when CNN asked for comment.                    Theyre not acknowledging peoples ability to understand their own bodies and know whats right for them, said Ushma Upadhyay, a professor in the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Science in the University of California, San Franciscos Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health.                The FDAs concern about provider oversight is not based on evidence, Upadhyay said. Some studies shes worked on have found that people are generally capable of determining how far along they are in their pregnancy. Several other studies have also shown that self-management  proceeding without direct medical supervision  with this kind of medication is safe and effective.        I'm a doctor. The law shouldn't force me to hurt my patients this way               Patients should also be trusted to know when it is appropriate for them and when it is not to seek help from a provider, Upadhyay said.                   The FDA relaxed certain federal regulations around medication abortion during the Covid-19 pandemic.                    Since 2011, mifepristone has been the subject of a type of restricted program the FDA uses to make sure the benefit of certain drugs outweighs any risk.                    There are 62 drugs in these programs, including some medications to treat cancer or MS, antipsychotics, opioids and testosterone. These medicines usually have some kind of contraindications, and the program requires a provider to be certified to administer them. For some, the provider must follow a specific plan to educate the patient about how the drug works.                   In December, the FDA allowed medication abortion pills to be sent by mail and said it would no longer enforce a rule that required people to get the first of the two pills in person at a clinic or hospital.                   Organizations like Choix, a California-based telehealth organization for reproductive and sexual health, have been prescribing mifepristone to people who arent pregnant as a way to expand access and to give the patient the power to access care when they need it with the support they deserve, Choix CEO Cindy Adam said.     'Heartbreaking' stories go untold, doctors say, as employers 'muzzle' them in wake of abortion ruling               Providing abortion care via telehealth, including advance provision, allows us to decrease the multitude of barriers to care that patients face and provides patients peace of mind, Adam said in an email to CNN. For some people, the time between finding out theyre pregnant and receiving abortion pills in the mail can be extremely stressful, and presents a range of challenges related to privacy, logistics, finances, their health, and more.                   Someone who uses Choix is counseled on what precautions they need to take when they get the medicine and screened for risk factors like a previous ectopic pregnancy, abdominal surgery or sexually transmitted infection, Adam said. Theyre told to seek additional care if they become pregnant and get a referral for in-person care if they need it.                   ??We??re also proud to offer ongoing, supportive abortion care from our providers as part of our advance provision service to support patients throughout the process,?? she said.         36% of US counties are 'maternity care deserts,' raising risks for women and babies, new report finds               Politico said the FDA would not comment on whether it is considering any changes to its restrictions or if it planned to enforce its regulations by fining doctors or companies that prescribe mifepristone in a way that is not approved.                   ??Providers are fully able to prescribe medications off-label, and in fact, some prescribe mifepristone up to 12 weeks?? into a pregnancy,  Upadhyay ",5,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CNNNews_25,"             The draft opinion, obtained and authenticated by Politico, heralds what would be a massive victory for the conservative movement decades in the making. It set off immediate condemnation and calls for action from leading liberal and medical groups and Democratic leaders, as well as protests outside the Supreme Court building.                   The bombshell concerns a draft majority opinion, written by conservative Justice Samuel Alito, that slammed the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision enshrining the right to an abortion as wrongly decided. It was circulated in early February, according to Politico, but the final opinion isnt expected to be published until late June. Votes and language can change before opinions are formally released.         What to know about the stunning disclosure of a draft Supreme Court opinion that could spell the end of national abortion rights               CNN has not independently confirmed the documents authenticity. A Supreme Court spokesperson declined to comment to CNN.                   But if the high court follows through on such a decision in the coming weeks, it would engineer a massive shift in American life and law  and provide a startling sign of just how fundamentally the conservative majority, solidified by former President Donald Trump, will change society in the decades to come. It would potentially cast into doubt all kinds of precedents and past court rulings that have been regarded as settled law for years.                    If the final decision is issued along the lines of Alitos draft, millions of American women could have a fundamental right, which many have known all of their lives, taken away. But millions of people who believe that life begins at conception would celebrate such a ruling.                    There will be weeks of debate about the legal reasoning and implications behind Alitos draft opinion.         Crowd gathers outside the Supreme Court after draft opinion circulated that would strike down Roe v. Wade               But in practice, such a ruling would seem likely to send the issue back to the states. That might mean abortion would be quickly banned by state legislatures in Republican-run states but remain legal in Democratic-run states. Such a scenario would further drive a schism between two halves of the country, which has been exacerbated by increasingly polarized politics in recent years.                   The emergence of the draft is also stunning in itself. It represents a major and likely unprecedented breach in court confidentiality that is almost certain to worsen the politicization of the court, which has been dragged deeper into partisanship since it decided the 2000 election in favor of George W. Bush over then-Vice President Al Gore and has only accelerated ever since.                    The draft also opened an unexpected new dimension to the midterm election campaign. The drama could stoke turnout in November for both parties.                   For now, it validates the decision of social conservatives to stick with Trump after he vowed to nominate justices that would overturn the constitutional right to abortion despite reservations about his moral conduct.         'Unbelievable shift': Klobuchar reacts to draft Supreme Court opinion               And if the court issues such an opinion, it would mean the ex-Presidents political legacy could endure potentially for decades.                   Such a ruling would reignite Democratic fury at then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnells refusal to confirm then-President Barack Obamas Supreme Court pick, Merrick Garland, in 2016. Four years later, the GOP leader ignored his own rule prohibiting confirmations in an election year when he rushed through Trumps pick, Amy Coney Barrett, days before the November contest.                   There is a possibility, however, that a final ruling to overturn Roe v. Wade  rather than a slower process of outlawing abortion with a more incremental set of decisions over time  could galvanize Democratic turnout, especially from women, in an election in which the party was girding for heavy losses.                   A CNN poll conducted by SSRS in January showed, for instance, that 69% of Americans opposed overturning Roe while 30% supported such a move.        Left and right react to unprecedented Supreme Court leak in different ways               CNN legal analyst and Supreme Court biographer Joan Biskupic reported late Monday that Chief Justice John Roberts did not want to completely overturn Roe, meaning he would have dissented from part of Alitos draft opinion, likely with the top benchs three liberals.                   That would still give the conservatives a 5-4 majority on the issue.                   Roberts is willing, however, to uphold the Mississippi law that would ban abortion at 15 weeks of pregnancy, CNN has learned. Under current law, government cannot interfere with a womans choice to terminate a pregnancy before about 23 weeks, when a fetus could live outside the womb.                   Democrats were quick to react to the Politico report, with many senators, or would-be senators, zeroing in on the filibuster.                   As the reverberations from the story rocked Washington on Tuesday morning, President Joe Biden issued a written statement that began with the caveat that it was unknown whether the draft was genuine and represented the final decision of the court. But he recalled that his administration had argued before the justices that Roe v. Wade was based on a long line of precedent.                   I believe that a woman??s right to choose is fundamental,?? Biden wrote. ??Roe has been the law of the land for almost fifty years, and basic fairness and the stability of our law demand that it not be overturned.??                   Late Monday, and in order to try to protect the right to an abortion legislatively, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders called on Democratic leaders to eliminate the requirement for major legislation to achieve a super majority of 60 votes to pass. ??Congress must pass legislation that codifies Roe v. Wade as the law of the land in this country NOW,?? Sanders wrote, calling for ",0,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CNNNews_26,"             With abortion banned in more than a dozen states and restricted in many others, its become about twice as common for people in the United States to travel across state lines for their abortion care, a new analysis found.

In a similar timeframe in 2020, before the US Supreme Courts Dobbs decision revoked the federal right to abortion, less than 1 in 10 people left their home state for an abortion  about 50,000 fewer people.                   The data probably understates the impact that the Dobbs decision has had, says Isaac Maddow-Zimet, a data scientist with the Guttmacher Institute and lead researcher for the new report. More people are traveling for abortion care, and theyre traveling farther  largely because many states with bans and restrictions border each other.                   Folks from Texas, for example, might have been traveling to Oklahoma [in 2020]. Now, in 2023, those folks are still traveling, but they cant travel to Oklahoma anymore. It leads to a situation where people have to cross multiple state lines and travel very far distances, Maddow-Zimet said. And when you have to travel so much farther, the costs start to multiply. It really implies much higher financial costs and much higher logistical costs.                   The increase in travel is changing the clinical needs for people seeking abortions, and providers are adapting.                   Clinics in Ohio are seeing patients at later gestational age, said Dr. Adarsh Krishen, chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio. And although medication abortion is still most common, more patients are opting for procedural abortion, he said, especially those who have traveled from other states who want to be sure it was effective.                   We treat each patient as an individual. Our commitment is to make sure that theyre getting the health care they need and deserve, Krishen said. There are just added layers of complexity.        In the South, looming uncertainty threatens the limited abortion access that remains               Supporting patients outside of the exam room also looks different.                   The abortion itself is the same no matter if you come from a banned state or you come from a state where abortion is still protected, said Amy Hagstrom Miller, the founder and chief executive officer of Whole Womans Health, an abortion provider with clinics in multiple states. But when a patient is in our clinic, lots of different things come into effect.                   People who traveled for abortion care may have time pressures, with a flight to catch or a long drive home, she said. Many have driven hundreds of miles and often travel with the family  both children and elders  whom they support.                   Whole Womans Health has adapted its waiting rooms accordingly, Hagstrom Miller said. In New Mexico, for example, clinics have a separate waiting room area with toys, snacks and comfortable couches to better serve patients and their families, especially those who have traveled for long hours.                   Nearly three-quarters of the abortions in New Mexico were provided to people who had traveled across state lines, according to the new data from the Guttmacher Institute. More than 8,200 people from out of state had an abortion in New Mexico in the first half of 2023. Only Illinois and North Carolina saw more out-of-state patients.                   ??The amount of things that people bring with them, literally and figuratively, is very different,?? Hagstrom Miller said. ??They??re tired and fatigued, but mostly they??re just so resolved. They??ve gone through so much to get that appointment. There is not indecision.??                   The new data from the Guttmacher Institute is based on a monthly survey of a core set of providers and broadened to the state level using a model that also factors in historical trends. Estimates represent abortions provided within formal health care settings, including in-person clinics and telehealth, but do not include data on self-managed abortions, such medication abortion provided by AidAccess.                   Earlier reports have found that abortions increased in the US overall after the Dobbs decision, especially in states that borde",2,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CNNNews_27,"             Trigger laws in three states  Idaho, Tennessee and Texas  will take effect Thursday, banning abortions in their respective states with few exceptions, though litigation continues around certain aspects of some of those states bans. These laws were designed to take effect 30 days following the US Supreme Courts transmission of its judgment overturning Roe v. Wade  a procedural step by the court that occurred on July 26.                   On Saturday, an Oklahoma law enacting higher criminal penalties for performing illegal abortions takes effect, adding to the states already tough laws prohibiting the procedure.                   For about 9.9 million women of reproductive age (15-49) in these five states, access to abortion will be impacted by these laws, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on sexual and reproductive health that supports abortion rights. With these laws in place, nearly one-third of US states will have restrictions or a near-total ban on abortion, according to abortion rights groups.        Where state abortion bans stand amid legal challenges               Before Thursday, abortion was already effectively banned in Texas, with clinics ceasing abortions as result of two Texas laws that could open them up to civil suits.                   Texas trigger law, passed in 2021, makes abortions illegal unless the pregnant woman is at risk of death or substantial impairment of a major bodily function. It does not provide exceptions in cases of rape or incest.                   Abortions up to six weeks of pregnancy had been available in Tennessee, but the law going into effect on Thursday bans abortions at all stages of pregnancy, except when necessary to prevent the pregnant womans death or serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a bodily function. Like Texas, Tennessee would also not allow for abortions in cases of rape or incest.        Judge blocks enforcement of Idaho's abortion ban in medical emergencies day before it was set to take effect               Idaho had also recently outlawed abortions after fetal cardiac activity is detected, which can occur around six weeks into pregnancy. Idahos trigger law prohibits performing abortions unless necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman, or in situations of rape or incest that have been reported to law enforcement. A federal judge issued a preliminary order Wednesday blocking enforcement of Idaho??s ban in certain medical emergenc",3,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CNNNews_28,"             Now that the Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade, much will rest on what laws states put in place  particularly those governing their residents ability to obtain abortions in other states and to be prescribed medication abortions, experts say.                   It would depend upon the legal language, said Doniella Pliss, a director on the health insurance ratings team at AM Best, a credit rating agency. For an insurance company, that is not an ideological issue. & They will go strictly by what the law is.                   Another important element is whether employers offer self-insured coverage, which is governed by federal regulation, or fully insured policies, which must comply with state rules. In the former, companies pay their workers health care costs, while in the latter, they contract with state-licensed insurers to cover the claims. Many large employers are self-insured.                   Health insurance coverage of abortion has long faced many limitations.                   Some 34 states and the District of Columbia allow Medicaid to cover abortions only in cases of rape, incest or endangerment of the womans life because of the Hyde Amendment, which restricts federal funding of the procedure, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. The remaining 16 states use their own money to provide broader Medicaid coverage of abortion.                   Some 26 states prohibit policies sold on their Affordable Care Act exchanges from covering abortion, with certain exceptions.                   When it comes to job-based plans, 11 states have laws that bar abortion benefits, with certain exceptions, in small business and large employer policies that the states regulate. Some states may allow abortion coverage to be purchased as a rider, according to Kaiser.                   Seven states have laws that require all of their fully insured employer plans, as well as Obamacare and other individual market policies, to provide abortion benefits.                   The federal law that regulates self-insured plans, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, known as ERISA, does not contain any abortion coverage limitations or requirements.                   But the federal Pregnancy Discrimination Act requires all employers that offer health insurance and have 15 or more workers to cover abortion if the woman??s life is at risk.                    About 10 states have effectively banned abortion since Friday??s Supreme Court ruling. And 26 states are certain or likel",3,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CNNNews_29,"             About a quarter of large U.S. employers heavily restrict coverage of legal abortions or dont cover them at all under health plans for their workers, according to the latest employer health benefits?survey by KFF.                   The findings demonstrate another realm, beyond state laws, in which access to abortion care varies widely across America since the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion last year in?Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization.                   More than ever, where someone works and the constraints of their health insurance can determine whether an abortion is possible. Workers without coverage are left to pay out-of-pocket for abortion care and related costs.        Premiums for family health insurance at work jump to nearly $24,000 this year               In 2021, the median costs for people paying out-of-pocket in the first trimester were $568 for a medication abortion and $625 for an abortion procedure,?according to a report?from Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health at the University of California-San Francisco. By the second trimester, the cost increased to $775 for abortion procedures.                   KFFs 2023 annual survey found that 10% of large employers  defined as those with at least 200 workers  dont cover legal abortion care under their largest job-based health plan. An additional 18% said legal abortions are covered only in limited circumstances, such as when a pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, or endangers a persons life or health.                   The share of employers that said they dont cover abortion under any circumstances is bigger than I would have expected, said Matthew Rae, an associate director at KFF who helped conduct the survey.                   So far, 14 states, mostly in the South and Midwest, have enacted near-total abortion bans, and an additional seven states have instituted gestational limits between six and 18 weeks. Abortion is legal in 24 states and the District of Columbia.                   Sharply divergent state abortion laws solidified in the aftermath of the?Dobbs?decision compound the complexity for employers with workers across multiple states, Rae said. Many large companies employ people in places with vastly different abortion policies, and their health benefits are more likely to cover dependents who may live elsewhere.                   Those dependents can be college kids  and college kids can be anywhere  or any other type of dependent who could just spread out over an area much larger than where you just have actual physical establishments, Rae said.                   The KFF survey found that about a third of large companies said they cover legal abortions in most or all circumstances; the largest companies, with at least 5,000 employees, were more likely to offer the benefit compared with smaller firms. An additional 40% said they were unsure of their coverage  perhaps because employer policies are in flux, Rae said.        See where abortions are banned and legal  and where its still in limbo               Employer health plans treatment of abortion has changed little since the?Dobbs decision, the survey found. Among companies that said they did not cover legally provided abortion services or covered them in limited circumstances, 3% reduced or eliminated abortion coverage. By contrast, of the large companies that generally covered abortion, 12% added or significantly expanded coverage.                   That??s in sharp contrast to the rapidly changing laws governing abortion access in the states. It??s unclear whether workers at companies that don??t cover abortion or heavily restrict coverage are located primarily in states that have outlawed the procedure.                   The KFF survey includes information from more than 2,100 large and small companies on their health benefits and the related ",1,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CNNNews_30,"             At about 10 weeks, Nancy Davis baby was diagnosed with acrania, a rare congenital disorder in which a fetus skull does not form inside of the womb, according to a statement from civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who represents Davis.                   Acrania is a lethal condition with death within the first week of life, according to the Fetal Medicine Foundation.                    However, after Davis decided to get an abortion, the hospital allegedly chose not to perform it, the statement said.

Earlier this month, Davis spoke to CNN affiliate WAFB about her situation, saying doctors told her she would be carrying the baby to bury the baby.??

CNNNews_31,"             Amy Hagstrom Miller probably knows US geography better than most.                   The founder and chief executive officer of Whole Womans Health, an abortion provider with clinics in multiple states, says its become a critical part of her work to know the routes of major highways and the best travel patterns for people to get out of states with restrictions to a provider.        See where abortions are banned and legal  and where its still in limbo               After the US Supreme Court decision that removed guaranteed access to abortion in June 2022, disparate state laws have created a fractured abortion landscape in the US  with massive upheaval across the South, in particular.                   Im staring at this map I have of the United States  its on a dry erase board because Ive had to change things all along  but it looks like what I would describe as a new borderlands, Hagstrom Miller said. She used to think of Mexico, the Gulf of Mexico and the oceans as the borders. Now, she said, she can trace a finger around the South, and thats the border now. All those contiguous states [to the South] have banned abortion.                   Of the 16 states in the South, 10 have banned abortion. Two have restricted it to the first trimester: Georgia with a six-week limit and North Carolina with a 12-week limit. Florida is one of four states in that US Census?region? along with Delaware, Maryland and Virginia  where abortion is legal past the first trimester.                   And things are far from settled in the region. Major legal and political challenges loom in some states, with?impacts that would reverberate through the region  and nationwide.                   Abortion is legal up to 15 weeks in Florida, making it one of the least?restrictive?states in the South. It has become a key access point for people?who are no longer able to receive care where they live, in addition to a significant number of its own residents.?But an impending ruling from the state Supreme Court could bring a dramatic shift.        States with restrictive abortion laws place more kids in foster care, particularly kids of color               Abortion?rights advocates have challenged the states 15-week ban, citing a decades-old precedent that abortion is protected by the state Constitution under the right to privacy. If the states high court rules that it does not protect the right to abortion, a stricter six-week limit would take?effect a month later, limiting access to a time before most people even know theyre pregnant.                   In the year since the Dobbs decision, abortion providers in Florida reported the third most abortions of any state and the second largest increase, according to a?report?from #WeCount, a research project led by the Society of Family Planning. There were more than 92,000 abortions in the state, about 20,000 more than the year before.                   If Floridas high court rules to restrict abortion access there, it would affect more than a third of abortions in the South and?nearly 1 in 10 nationwide.                   Florida would be extreme, Hagstrom Miller said. I just stare at the map and think, OK, if they ban abortion in Florida or they ban abortion in Georgia, where are people going to go?                   Displaced patients from Florida and those from other states who relied on the clinics there would probably head north for care, experts say, flooding providers that are already stretched thin and straining the limited resources that remain.                   Abortion bans dont change the need for an abortion, Hagstrom Miller said.        Abortions increased in the US overall in the year post-Dobbs, but there are stark inequalities state-to-state               In fact, average monthly abortions in the US increased in the year after the Dobbs decision, the #WeCount report found  but thousands more patients were served by a significantly smaller number of providers.                   Providers in states where abortion remains legal are doing their best to keep up.                   We dont know what the next step will be, and it certainly causes anxiety, said Michael Scheinberg, director of operations for the Falls Church Healthcare Center, an abortion clinic in northern Virginia.                   Its hard to say whether the clinic is at full capacity at any time, he says, because theres ongoing analysis of patient needs and regular adjustments the clinics offerings to match. Requests for medication abortion have become more common, for example, but theres also been an increased need for procedural abortions for people with later gestational age, many of whom have had to travel from other states.                   We kind of tweak things around to make sure that were able to see as many patients as we possibly can with the resources that we have available, just hoping that we are able to keep up with the trends, he said. In this case, the best way that we can work is to be as positive as we can and try to help as much as we can.                   Whole Womans Health has two clinics in Virginia: one in Alexandria and one a bit farther south in Charlottesville. Although it doesnt always fill all available appointment slots, patient volumes have increased significantly over the past year, Hagstrom Miller said  and the potential impact of a Florida ban is big enough that shes considering opening another clinic along the North Carolina border, along with expanding gestational limits and increasing capacity in the existing locations.                   Even if providers are able to absorb a surge from Florida, individuals seeking abortions need to find the means to travel significant distances for care.                   Abortion funds can help fill the financial gap for some, but many of those organizations are stretched thin, as well.        Abortions have increased significantly in states that border those with bans, new analysis finds               The Tampa Bay Abortion Fund had to close its doors to new clients for a month this fall, said Bree Wallace, its director of case management. And now, for the first time, it??s budgeting how much it??s spending each month.                   Donations aren??t as large or as frequent as they were right after the Dobbs decision, Wallace said, despite a growing need.                   ??We??re spending more, but we??re not recouping,?? she said. And supporting out-of-state travel would be raise expenses significantly.                   At the midway point for the latest budget ",2,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CNNNews_32,"             About a year after the courts Dobbs decision, 80% of US adults say that their views on abortion have not changed. More than 6 in 10 say that abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while about a third say that it should be illegal in all or most cases. This divide has changed little over the past few decades, Pew data shows.        Amid contradictory laws, hospitals in one state were unable to explain policies on emergency abortion care, study finds               Most adults nationwide say that it would still be easy to get an abortion where they live, but that has dropped significantly over the past four years  especially in states where abortions are currently banned.                    Now, more than 70% of adults in states where abortion is prohibited say that it would be difficult to get one in their area, up from 50% in 2019. In states where there are restrictions or ongoing legal disputes, more than half (56%) of adults say that it would be difficult to get an abortion, up from 41% in 2019. In states where abortion is legal, however, this number has stayed consistently around 20%.                   At the same time, a growing share of adults support easier access to abortions where they live, including more than a quarter of those living in states where it is legal.       Other research has shown that the average travel time to get an abortion more than tripled after the Dobbs decision, as states enacting complete or partial bans on abortion effectively cut the number of active facilities by a tenth.                   The partisan divide on abortions is wide and growing, Pew survey data shows.                   About 40% of Republicans say that abortion should be legal in all or most cases, holding relatively consistent since 2007. Democrats are more than twice as likely to support legal abortion, growing from 63% support in 2007 to 84% in 2023.                   Nearly half of Democrats say that it should be easier for someone to get an abortion in the area where they live, while nearly as many Republicans say that it should be harder for someone to get an abortion where they live.        What comes next after the Supreme Court blocked -- for now -- restrictions on abortion pills                And perceptions of local laws differ by party. In states where abortion is currently banned, more than 8 out of 10 Democrats say that it would be difficult for someone to get an abortion, compared with about 6 out of 10 Republicans. A similar gap exists in states where abortion is restricted or facing ongoing legal dispute.                   Overall, however, there is widespread confusion about abortion laws. An earlier survey from KFF found that nearly half of adults in the US ?C including 2 out of 5 women of childbearing age ?C were unsure whether medication abortion is legal in their state.                   But most demographic groups have held steady in their views on abortion since last year.                   According",0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CNNNews_33,"             Morgan Levy, a medical school student at the University of Miami, said the impacts of the ruling immediately became a point of discussion among her peers. Shell be applying to residency training programs this fall, and now has to assess whether the new laws will affect what shes taught and how.         36% of US counties are 'maternity care deserts,' raising risks for women and babies, new report finds               More than ever, I recognize the importance of good, comprehensive, evidence-based reproductive health care, said Levy, who plans to train as an ob/gyn. In some states, though, it has become all but impossible to get formal family planning training, including abortion practices.                    There is definitely a consideration of making sure that the training programs that Im applying to are going to be able to provide the kind of training that Im going to need in order to be able to do that for my patients, she said.                   And new data suggests that these restrictions are having an impact on where  and what  future doctors plan to practice.                    The number of medical school students who applied to residency training programs ticked down last year, and applications to programs in states with abortion bans dropped the most, according to a new analysis from the Association of American Medical Colleges.                    Interest in the ob/gyn speciality took a notable dip, with applications dropping 5% nationwide and twice as much in states where abortion is banned. Emergency medicine also saw a significantly large drop in applications.                    Despite the decline in applications, all ob/gyn residency positions and most others were filled. So while theres no immediate shortage of physicians in-training, experts say the shift is reason for concern.                    I worry about exacerbating these maternal health care and abortion deserts that already exist. We already have a gap, said Dr. Kristyn Brandi, an ob/gyn in New Jersey and chair of the board of directors for Physicians for Reproductive Health. Because of that, we need more ob/gyns to join the field to help build up practice in places where were losing providers for other reasons.                   More than a third of US counties have limited or no access to maternity care, according to a recent report  and theres notable overlap between maternity care deserts and states where abortion access is limited.                   Most physicians stay in the area that they trained. If programs in states with abortion bans shift to less desirable training plans, more and more students could prioritize being in less restrictive states for residency  and eventually to practice.                   Long-term, that could create a ??tiered system of health care,?? Brandi said.         Maternity units are closing across America, forcing expectant mothers to hit the road                  However, experts say it will be important to track the preferences for medical school students in the years to come. Last year??s graduating class applied to residency programs just months after the Supreme Court??s ruling. They had to make decisions before seeing exactly how the programs would react and adjust.                    ??For the next year or two, things are gonna be really uncertain for people. And I think that many people didn??t want to engage in that uncertainty, not knowing what they were signing up for,?? Brandi said.                    For Levy and others, perhaps more important than the specific location of a program is evidence that there is a strong and well-established commitment to training around family planning.

CNNNews_34,"Hot Stocks     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News                  Hot Stocks      Editors Note: This is an updated version of a story that originally ran on May 14, 2022.               The overturning of the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling by the US Supreme Court comes at an economic cost to the nation, economists have warned.       Fridays decision to end the federal constitutional right to an abortion is widely thought to be more ideologically and politically motivated, rather than driven by an attempt to protect women from worse personal and financial outcomes. Those might include financial hardship, restricted ability to attain a higher education and move up the socio-economic ladder, as well as overall poorer health care for women reliant on clinics for preventative care. All of this would affect the state of the workforce, economic output and increase the need for government support, economists say.                   This decision will cause immediate economic pain in 26 states where abortion bans are most likely and where people already face lower wages, less worker power, and limited access to health care, said Heidi Shierholz, president of the Economic Policy Institute, in a statement released Friday. The fall of Roe will be an additional economic barricade.                   The consequences are likely so extensive and far-reaching that it is hard to quantify them, said Jason Lindo, professor of economics at Texas A&M.                   Taking away a womans right to choose if and when she has a child has serious consequences for her career and economic circumstances, Lindo told CNN Business.                   In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee last month, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that restricting womens reproductive rights would have very damaging effects on the economy.                   Roe v. Wade and access to reproductive health care, including abortion, helped lead to increased labor force participation, Yellen said. It enabled many women to finish school. That increased their earning potential. It allowed women to plan and balance their families and careers.                   Last year, after Texas lawmakers moved to effectively ban abortion in the state, 154 economists filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court in support of maintaining reproductive freedoms in the United States so that women can realize their full economic and educational potential.                   Data from the prominent Turnaway Study from the University of California San Francisco, shows that household finances are a major driver of the decision to terminate an unwanted pregnancy. An analysis of the data by the National Bureau of Economic Research shows that the majority of women seeking to terminate a pregnancy near the gestational limits had incomes below the poverty line.                   Women who were denied an abortion, meanwhile, had higher rates of poverty, higher unemployment and greater need for government assistance. This, in turn, affects the economic well-being and prospects of their children, according to economists.                   ??There is a huge [body of] literature showing long-run effects of the economic circumstanc",1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CNNNews_35,"             When the Supreme Courts opinion overturning Roe v. Wade came down, I was overwhelmed by a memory of my 15-year-old self as a student living in Puerto Rico.                    My science teacher pulled me out of class, told me to sit across from her at an empty lab table and asked me, point blank, if I was having sex with my boyfriend. To this day, I remember the purple shade of her heavy eyeshadow, the way she nervously patted her sweaty neck with a tissue.                   I stared at her in disbelief, wondering if anything I said would be used against me, or even land me in the office of the principal  a nun who ran our private Catholic school like a military officer.                   It was only in hindsight that I realized that my body  and what I chose to do with it  had become a matter of public opinion in my community. This teacher believed herself justified to police my most intimate choices. What gave her the right?                    Afraid to tell the truth, I told her no. I was then subjected to a lecture on the evils of pre-marital sex that left me reeling with shame about the physical pleasure I experienced in my relationship.                      Now, 27 years later, its no longer a science teacher policing my body  what I can and cannot do with it  but instead a group that has grown to include six Supreme Court justices and the state of Georgia, where I live today.                   Whats at stake in the abortion debate isnt just the constitutionality of regulating abortion, but the right of all women to wield control over their bodies  a right that already is eroded daily in classrooms across the country. In schools everywhere, discriminatory dress codes have become a means to further oppress girls and marginalized communities under the guise of an educational institution.                       Before the pandemic, I spent two years researching the effects of sexist, racist and anti-LGBTQ dress codes on girls and marginalized communities. The research resulted in a co-authored novel for young adults, Does My Body Offend You? written with scholar Marie Marquardt. The book touches on themes of intersectional feminism, allyship and student protest.        Opinion: Women athletes' lives are now going to be vastly more complicated               While conducting our research, we learned of a Florida teen who was removed from class for not wearing a bra and asked to cover her nipples with Band-Aids. An 11-year-old in Maryland was disciplined for wearing leggings. An 8th grader in Georgia was cited for a rip in her jeans. In North Carolina, a sophomore was penalized over beads in her traditional African hairstyle. In Michigan, a Catholic high school threatened students with a modesty poncho.                    In most cases, girls lost precious class time over spaghetti straps, yoga pants, hair extensions and even the size of their breasts  because, to quote one teacher, smaller busted women could get away with more than larger busted women. Black girls are the most frequently targeted group when it comes to violations, according to social justice scholar and author Monique Morris.                   Repeatedly, school officials define girls bodies as offensive, sexy, provoking, problematic and inappropriate. Exposed thighs and collarbones, too-large breasts, Black hair, too-wide hips and a too-big butt, along with other mundane body parts are sexualized and weaponized.                   How will girls gain the right for body autonomy as women, if their bodies are being objectified and devalued by the institutions they are told to trust? How will they develop the capacity to fight back? Schools are but a microcosm of the control they will face, as adult women, from lawmakers, government agencies, religious groups, even healthcare providers.                   ??Objectification creates a hierarchy in which objectified bodies are less human, less valued and less privileged than others,?? argues Rouhollah Aghasaleh, a Humboldt State University professor and author of the article ??Oppressive Curriculum: Sexist, Racist, Classist, and Homophobic Practice of Dress Codes in Schooling.??                   Dress codes, writes Aghasaleh, ??convey sexism with a male centered gaze and racism with White middle-class norms that serve as a hidden curriculum???? They also play a role in victim blaming and rape culture, he adds.         Opinion: Cruel GOP rhetoric about rape survivors and abortion is far more than words               A 2020 study by University of Wisconsin professor Gretchen Whitman further links the process of objectification in schools to the erosion of women??s rights.

CNNNews_36,"             The GOP-led House voted on Wednesday to pass a bill that would require health care providers to try to preserve the life of an infant in the rare case that a baby is born alive during or after an attempted abortion. The bill is not expected to be taken up in the Democratic-controlled Senate, but passage in the House serves as a messaging opportunity for the new Republican majority. The vote was 220 to 210.                     Under the bill, health providers who fail to comply with the requirements for care could face fines or up to five years in prison. The bill would not impose penalties on the mother and would grant the mother protection from any kind of prosecution.        Meet the group protecting patients from protesters outside abortion clinics               Opponents have argued that such measures restrict abortion access by threatening health care providers. It is already considered homicide in the US to intentionally kill an infant that is born alive.                   The decision by the new Republican majority to hold the vote comes after Democrats worked to make abortion a front-and-center issue during the midterm elections following Roes reversal. Republicans succeeded in taking back control of the House in the midterms, but a much-anticipated red wave failed to materialize, leading to questions  and finger pointing within the GOP  over exactly which factors played a key role in the outcome.                   The measure the House voted on  called the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act  was introduced on Monday by Republican Rep. Ann Wagner of Missouri.                    NARAL Pro-Choice America released a statement on Tuesday criticizing the bill, along with several others.                   These bills make it plain: House Republicans are patently rejecting the will of the overwhelming majority of Americans who voted to support legal abortion in November, the organizations president Mini Timmaraju said. Meanwhile, our Democratic reproductive freedom champions in the House are ready and willing to fight to restore and expand access to abortionand we thank them for that.                   The House also voted on Wednesday to pass a separate measure condemning ??recent attacks on pro-life facilities, groups and churches.??

CNNNews_39,"             Medication abortion, also known as medical abortion, is the method by which someone ends their pregnancy using pills rather than a surgical procedure. Its the most common form of abortion in the United States.       Related article Journal publisher retracts studies used by Texas judge who ruled to suspend use of abortion pill               Its also come under fire recently. In April, a Texas judge suspended the US Food and Drug Administrations approval of mifepristone, one of the drugs used in the practice in the United States. The medication is still available while the ruling is under review by the US Supreme Court.                   US providers have offered telehealth services for medication abortion at some level since around 2008, but it became a much more widely used option during the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2021, the FDA said it would no longer require an in-person appointment for a provider to dispense the drugs, making way for more virtual appointments in states where abortion and telehealth for abortion arent banned.                   The latest study, published Thursday in the journal Nature Medicine, shows that with very rare exceptions, telehealth for medication abortion is effective and safe, whether the person uses a secure form of texting or a video call. Most of the participants in the study worked with a provider through text, although they could also have a followup call or videoconference.                   The study looked at records from 6,034 medication abortions provided via telehealth between April 2021 and January 2022 at three virtual clinics that operate in 20 states and the District of Columbia. The effectiveness and safety of medication abortion provided through video and text appointments was found to be similar to numbers in other studies involving in-person medication abortion care.       Related article Uncertainty around US abortion landscape drives surge in requests to stockpile abortion medication, research shows               As with in-person appointments, the patients who chose the telehealth option werent required to undergo any testing or physical examination; rather, a provider made the decision to provide abortion medication based on their medical history.                   Medication abortion is intended to be used up until 10 weeks after the start of the pregnant persons last menstrual period. It is not recommended for people with certain health conditions and those who have had an ectopic pregnancy, a rare event in which a fertilized egg implants itself outside of the uterus.                   In the new study, patients who had any risk factors or symptoms for an ectopic pregnancy or those who were potentially beyond the required gestational age were referred for an ultrasound.                   Of the 6,034 abortions in the study, 99.8% were not followed by a serious adverse event.                   In total, 0.25% of patients experienced a serious abortion-related adverse event, 0.16% were treated for an ectopic pregnancy and 1.3% abortions were followed by emergency department visits, the study says.       Related article ??Fleeing under the cover of darkness??: How Idaho??s abortion ban is changing pregnancy in the state               The study also showed that medication abortion was highly effective, as 97.7% of participants had a complete abortion after taking the pills, with no need for any subsequent intervention. Among those whose abortion was not initially complete, 0.56% took more medication to complete the procedure, 1.4% needed a surgical procedure, and 0.94% had a confirmed or suspected continued pregnancy.

CNNNews_40,"             The Supreme Courts landmark decision on Friday to overturn the near 50-year constitutional right for a woman to end a pregnancy is triggering aftershocks that have already begun to change the character of American life.                   The realization is dawning that a daring conservative Supreme Court majority has, with its willingness to trample long-held precedent, introduced a destabilizing dynamic that may go far beyond abortion in a nation already internally estranged by ideology.                   More practically, and suddenly, abortion services have already ended in some conservative states. In some places on Friday, women in clinics were told as soon as the Supreme Court decision came down that their chance of an abortion in the state was gone.                     Wisconsin has reverted to a 19th century law banning abortion.                    "" South Dakotas last abortion clinic is preparing to move to Minnesota.                    "" Other red states are expected to act within days.        More liberal states like California are vowing to serve as havens for women",3,3,,is now at risk from activist justices. Uncertainty is growing about how the ruling will affect fertility treatments and even contraception. And businesses are hurriedly working out plans to compensate employees or extend health insurance to cover out-of-state abortion services but also worrying about alienating leaders in red states spoiling for a fight.        Chief Justice John Roberts lost the Supreme Court and the defining case of his generation               Abortion is a deeply personal issue for people of all political beliefs. Many conservatives view the procedure as the murder of an unborn child. Many other Americans view the Supreme Courts move as a callous infringement on human rights,namely a womans ability to make choices about her own body. Public opinion is often more nuanced than the black-and-white certainties of the political debate,especially over at what point of a pregnancy abortion should be allowed and what exceptions should be made for rape,incest or the health of the mother,but the reality remains that a clear majority of the country did not want to see the court overturn Roe.                    The core rationale of the courts conservative majority on Friday was that by returning the issue to the states,it would enable a democratic resolution of a contentious national issue. The last three days suggest that position was either na?ve or willfully self-deceiving.                   Republican leaders are already grappling,and in many cases,failing,to come up with answers about how and if they will help new mothers,whom they will force to bear children they may not want,even in some cases after rape and incest.                    Across at least half of the United States,the Supreme Courts ruling promised new hardship for poor and minority Americans who in many cases cannot afford to travel to have an abortion or are already hurt by insufficient social services.                   Leading Democrats responded with strong words and vows to fight back but have yet to mount an effective response,either politically ahead of 2022 or practically on the ground,where millions of women are suddenly left without their rights.        Scrapping Roe v. Wade makes the US an outlier in the West. Here's how it compares on abortion rights               Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said the court has set a torch to its legitimacy. And New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,who accused conservative justices of lying in their Senate confirmation hearings about how they would rule on abortion,said impeachment should be on the table.                    But as President Joe Biden left Saturday for the G7 summit of industrialized nations in Germany,White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said he was sticking by his opposition to expanding the court and to eliminating the Senate filibuster. While the latter move would be needed to codify the right to abortion  its unlikely all Democrats in the Senate would go along with abolishing the 60-vote threshold. This new evidence of the gap between Biden and progressives may fuel fresh speculation about his standing in his party as he prepares to run for reelection.                   But after a stunning conservative victory that electrified the GOP base,Republicans hoping to widen their national appeal must also consider how to position themselves in ways that wont alienate moderate and some women voters amid complex and nuanced attitudes toward abortion.        Former President Donald Trump was basking in the credit that he is due for installing a radical conservative majority on the Supreme Court. As a rally crowd in Illinois chanted Thank you Trump on Saturday night,the ex-commander-in-chief proclaimed a victory for life. Privately though,Trump was worried about the impact of the upheaval on his 2024 White House hopes and Republicans,The New York Times reported.

CNNNews_41,"             Some states have restricted the practice, but in December, the US Food and Drug Administration relaxed certain federal regulations on what is now the most commonly used abortion method in the United States.       What is medication abortion?               Medication abortion, also known as abortion with pills or medical abortion, is a method by which someone ends their pregnancy by taking two pills, rather than having a surgical procedure.                    The first pill is mifepristone, sold under the brand names Mifeprex or Korlym. Its also known as RU 486. The second pill is called misoprostol.        What to know about the stunning disclosure of a draft Supreme Court opinion that could spell the end of national abortion rights   How does it work?               Mifepristone blocks a hormone called progesterone, which the body needs for the pregnancy to continue. The hormone helps maintain the inside of the uterus. When the hormone is absent, the uterus will expel its contents.                    After taking mifepristone, the patient waits 24 to 48 hours to take misoprostol. That helps empty the uterus through bleeding and muscle contractions.                   The drugs typically cause intense cramps and heavy bleeding for about 3 to 5 hours. A regular menstrual period will usually resume in a couple of weeks.                   Within 14 days of taking the medicine, the patient will typically go back to a health clinic or doctors office for a follow-up appointment. A health care professional will do a lab test or an ultrasound to confirm that the abortion is complete. They will also check the patient for infection.        When can you have a medication abortion?               The drugs can be taken immediately after someone learns that theyre pregnant, up to 11 weeks after the first day of the last menstrual period, depending on where the person lives. State laws vary.     What abortion access looks like in America even before the Supreme Court reconsiders Roe v. Wade   Can you get pregnant again after having it?               Yes, but a person who takes these drugs should use a birth control for at least a month afterward.       When was the process approved?               The FDA approved mifepristone, coupled with misoprostol, for abortion use in 2000. This combination is also available in more than 60 other countries.                   In 2016, the FDA approved a supplemental application from the maker of Mifeprex to change the regimen and the drug label.    Who shouldnt take the drugs?               Medication abortion medicines shouldnt be taken 70 or more days after the start of the last menstrual period.                    People who have certain health conditions or who have had an ectopic pregnancy, a rare event in which the fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, shouldnt have a medication abortion.                    Its not recommended for people who have an intrauterine device (IUD) for birth control, although the device can be removed before the medication abortion. People on long-term systemic corticosteroid therapy and those who are allergic to the drugs or similar medications also shouldnt use them.                   People with anemia can take the drugs, but they may need more monitoring because of the bleeding that happens.       How many people use this method?               The number of people seeking abortions overall has fallen, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the percentage of people using an abortion pill has increased among those who chose to have an abortion. A February study from the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights think tank, found that an estimated 54% of people chose this method in 2020. In 2017, 39% did.        FDA says medication abortion drug can be distributed by mail during pandemic   How do you get the pills?               Unlike with most medications that you can pick up at a nearby pharmacy, only a health care provider who is certified can order, prescribe and dispense the pills for a medication abortion.                    Since 2011, the medicine has come from a restricted program called the Mifepristone Shared REMS Program. REMS stands for Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, a program the FDA uses for specific drugs to make sure the benefit outweighs any risk. Typically, drugs are in this program have some complications or contraindications.                    There are 62 drugs in REMS programs, including some cancer drugs, drugs used to treat MS, antipsychotics, opioids and testosterone. Drugs in this program usually require a provider to be certified to administer them, and some require the provider follow a specific plan to educate the patient about how the drug works.                    Telehealth is an option in some states. A person can consult with a provider by phone or text and then receive the pills by mail if the person lives in a state where abortion is legal.                    The law of the patients location is whats going to control if the person has access, said Amanda Allen, senior counsel and director of the Lawyering Project, an organization that uses the law to improve abortion access.                   A person could also go to a state where abortion is legal and have the pills shipped there.       Are the rules the same about access to abortion pills across the US?               Access to pills is not equal in all states.       In April 2021, the FDA allowed medication abortion pills to be sent by mail during the Covid-19 pandemic and said it would no longer enforce a rule that required women to get the first of the two pills in person at a clinic or hospital.                    In December, it removed the requirement that mifepristone be dispensed only in certain health care settings. It added a requirement that pharmacies be certified to dispense it.                   As of April, 32 states permit only licensed physicians to prescribe mifepristone pills according to the Guttmacher Institute. Nineteen  require a clinician to be physically present when a person takes this medicine, that restricts the telemedicine option. Two states prohibit the use of medica",2,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CNNNews_42," Use of medication abortion, in which patients use a two-pill regime to end their pregnancies, has been increasing steadily since the method was approved in 2000. However, the Covid-19 pandemic  and how it made patients more comfortable with telehealth while a facilitating a loosening of federal regulations around the pills use  may have increased the methods prevalence.         What is medication abortion?               As medication abortion has become more popular, however, Republican-controlled states have become more aggressive about imposing their own limits on access.                    Were seeing two major trends in 2022. One is around abortion bans. And the other is around medication abortion, said Elizabeth Nash, senior state issues manager at the Guttmacher Institute, which collected the new data.                    Surveying all known abortion providers, preliminary data assembled by Guttmacher show that 54% of US abortions in 2020 were medication abortions. That is a significant increase from 2017, the last time the think tank reported data of this sort, when medication abortions made up 39% of abortions.                    While some individual states may have crossed the 50% threshold in earlier years, the new report is the first time medication abortion has been shown to make up a majority of abortions nationwide, according to Guttmacher.                    Federal regulations allow for medication abortion pills to be sent in the mail; prior to the pandemic, the federal government required patients to pick up the pills in person at a clinic, even if they would ultimately take the pills at home. In December, the US Food and Drug Administration announced it was permanently lifting that in-person requirement, after a 2020 court order prompted the agency to suspend it temporarily for the pandemic.                    As the Supreme Court appears poised gut the national legal standard protecting abortion rights, permanently relaxing medication abortion rules was one of very few actions the federal government could take to shore up access to the procedure.                   The FDA??s move has already been counteracted by several Republican-led states, where bills t",5,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CNNNews_43,"             A new study finds that in states with certain restrictive abortion laws, even before the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the number of children whose parents couldnt or wouldnt care for them increased and their children end up in foster care.        Opinion: The right-wings opposition to abortion is not about saving or protecting women lives               The study, published Monday in JAMA Pediatrics, found that there was an 11% increase in children placed in foster care in states with certain abortion restrictions called TRAP laws, following the enactment of those TRAP laws, relative to states without such abortion restrictions. The study saw this increase by comparing the number of children who were conceived between 1990 and 2011 and placed in foster care between 2000 and 2020 in states with TRAP laws to those who lived in states without such laws. More than 4 million children went into foster care during this time period. Black children disproportionately got placed in foster care.                   TRAP stands for Targeted Restrictions on Abortion Providers. Ever since abortion became legal in 1973, states found ways to create laws that reduce access to abortion by restricting what clinics can and cant do. Often restrictions become so burdensome, down to prescribing how long a hall in a clinic must be, clinics shut down. So, people seeking an abortion in these states may have a right to an abortion, but finding one is impossible. Twenty-three states have such restrictions.                   Anti-abortion politicians often argue TRAP laws protect mothers and children, but multiple studies and courts have found that the laws do not make the procedure any safer.                   Compared to people who live in states without abortion access issues, studies have consistently shown that pregnant people who live in abortion-restrictive states typically face more problems, some of them are even deadly. People are much more likely to die in childbirth or die due to a pregnancy-related issues, particularly people of color who live in abortion restricted states, earlier studies have shown and so are their infants. People denied abortions are also much more likely to experience financial distress.    Opinion: The Dobbs effect isnt just galvanizing voters, its creating candidates               An 11% increase in the number of children put into foster care may not sound like a lot, but the foster care system is already overburdened. The situation became even more stressed during the pandemic. In 2022, more than half of all states saw a significant decline in the number of available foster care homes, one study showed. So, even an 11% increase could push the system into further jeopardy.                   With the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the situation isnt likely to improve, according to study coauthor Dr. Savannah Atkins, a lecturer in Economics at Bentley University.                   Now with a total restriction of abortion in certain states, were obviously going to see this being exacerbated, said Atkins. We need to take into account these effects when were thinking of these, you know, sweeping legislations that regulate abortion.        See where abortions are banned and legal  and where its still in limbo               An editorial that a",4,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CNNNews_44,"             The Supreme Courts landmark decision allowing states to ban abortion raises  new questions about how authorities will enforce such bans and whether the anti-abortion movement will stick to its public emphasis on protecting abortion seekers themselves from prosecution.                   What has been the pattern abroad in countries that ban abortion, along with United States own experience before Roe, previews a complicated and unequal enforcement landscape.         Justice Sonia Sotomayor continues her warnings of a dramatic conservative turn at the Supreme Court                For years as they fought to overturn Roe v. Wade, leaders of the anti-abortion movement have stressed that prosecutions should be focused on abortion providers and others who facilitate the procedure, rather than the person seeking it. But the movements critics point to examples of when the criminal justice system has already  with Roe still on the books  been turned on women whose pregnancies have been purposely or inadvertently terminated.                    In one 2018 case, for instance, a Mississippi woman who experienced a stillbirth was accused of second degree murder after authorities obtained her phone data and found she had searched for abortion pills. (The case was later dropped after prosecutors took a closer look at the evidence, including the use of a scientifically questionable test to supposedly determine whether the fetus had been born alive.)                   One major challenge abortion foes will be facing if Roe falls is the growing use of medication abortion, which allows for women to manage their own abortions in two-pill regimen without the help of the kind of physician that would conventionally be prosecuted under an abortion ban.                     Because pregnancies that end in a natural miscarriage are often indistinguishable from those terminated with a pill, its possible that womens private data and the information they share with their medical staff will be weaponized by prosecutors. Even if the woman herself is not criminally liable, she may still be dragged through the law enforcement process as part of prosecutors efforts to investigate whether her pregnancy was illegally terminated.        Supreme Court's decision on abortion could open the door to overturn same-sex marriage, contraception and other major rulings               What I found in my research is that women were indeed punished, even if, you know, almost none of them are prosecuted and incarcerated for having an abortion, said Leslie Reagan, a history professor at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and author of When Abortion Was a Crime. That is through the methods of enforcement: interrogating women who were seeking emergency services after having an abortion or trying to induce their own.                   Whether to bring a case under a state abortion restriction will be a decision ultimately for the local prosecutor, and the promise of some district attorneys in Democratic-leaning localities to not prosecute abortion crimes has prompted red states to explore other mechanisms to carry out bans.                    But in places where law enforcement officials seek to enforce abortion prohibitions, medical staff who provide treatment to women whose pregnancies have ended could also end up being a source of information for law enforcement officers.                    In El Salvador, a country with an extremely aggressive approach to carrying out its ban on abortion, government officials are dispatched to hospitals to stress to medical staff their obligation to report suspicions that a patient has intentionally ended her pregnancy, according to Michelle Oberman, a Santa Clara University School of Law professor and author of Her Body, Our Laws: On the Frontlines of the Abortion War from El Salvador to Oklahoma.                    Doctors are told that if they dont report those women, they themselves can be subject to fines and other penalties, Oberman said.                    In the United States pre-Roe era, women who sought medical care after abortions faced interrogations, Reagan said, including threats that we wont provide medical, the medical care that you urgently, urgently need unless they cooperated with the investigations.                   Even now, medical care that women receive for pregnancies that have been ended can lead to law enforcement getting involved, according to Dana Sussman, the acting executive director of National Advocates for Pregnant Women. Sussmans organization provides defense attorneys and other resources for people facing charges or investigations related to pregnancy and its outcomes. The organization has documented 1,700 arrests, prosecutions, detentions, or forced medical interventions between 1973 and 2020 on women related to pregnancy or pregnancy outcomes, though the majority of those cases dont involve a pregnancy loss or abortion.                   If Roe is reversed, Sussman said, I think that there will potentially be a lot more collaboration between health care providers and the police.                    The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act  a 1996 law also known as HIPAA that sets privacy standards for protecting patients personal medical information  has exceptions for law enforcement purposes, Sussman noted. As we expand the ways in which criminal law applies in these contexts, the HIPAA protections are going to be more limited.                    Another common tactic the organization has seen in its work is law enforcement using womens personal data to find evidence.        She was 7 weeks pregnant. She felt her only option was to order abortion pills online               When you do have someone who presents with a pregnancy loss and the police or prosecutors are trying to build a case that there was a self-managed abortion, Sussman told CNN, what they will look at is ones digital footprint & who they communicated with and when and about what, what they searched, for purchases they made, credit card bills.                    She predicted that this sort of digital evidence will be the thing that prosecutors will need in order to make that distinction, if they are going to try to distinguish between a miscarriage and a self-managed abortion.                    In the Mississippi case, investigators secured a warrant to search the phone of Latice Fisher, a Black woman who had experienced a stillbirth at her home in 2017. To bring the charges, they pointed to data showing she had searched for abortion pills earlier in her pregnancy (there is no way to medically test whether medication abortion drugs are in womans system after a miscarriage or stillbirth, since the drugs are usually metabolized more quickly than the time it takes for the fetus to expel). To build the case against Fisher, investigators also relied on a test known as the lung float test, a controversial method for investigating allegations of infanticide that dates back to the 17th century and that has been discredited by many medical experts.                   Fisher??s lawyers pushed back on the use of the ??float test.?? After prosecutors reviewed the questions about the reliability of that method, as well as other allegations about Fisher that they found to be uncorroborated,  they dropped the original indictment. When they represented the case to the grand jury with more context around the evidence, the grand jury declined to bring new charges against Fisher.

CNNNews_45,"             As one of the last two House Republicans who voted in support of womens reproductive rights, I have a nuanced perspective on abortion.                   During my time in Congress, I voted against defunding Planned Parenthood and against the 20-week abortion ban. That pleased pro-choice advocates. But parts of my voting record pleased pro-life advocates, too.                    For instance, I voted for the long-established Hyde Amendment wording contained in federal spending bills. This language prohibits federal funding for abortion except in cases of rape, incest and life or health of the mother. And I voted in favor of a bill that would notify parents if their minor child attempts to get an abortion across state lines, unless a judge intervenes to allow the minor to do so.                     My voting record in many ways reflects the views of most Americans. Many people like me who self-identify as pro-choice feel abortion should be legal in most cases, but with responsible restrictions. Conversely, many self-identified pro-life Americans believe abortion should almost always be illegal, but with some exceptions, like rape, incest and life or health of the mother.                    I vividly recall one House Appropriations Committee meeting where a Republican member intended to add Hyde funding language to the Homeland Security spending bill  but he wanted to omit the rape exception and revise the incest exception so that it would apply only to minors.                    Understandably, Democrats on the committee exploded in anger, and I agreed with their opposition to the proposed changes. But some Democrats went even further, arguing against the agreed upon Hyde language for federal spending bills  language which had been law for over 40 years.                    I stood up and lectured members from both parties for attempting to unravel what had been an uneasy, but mutually accepted, status quo. I told everyone to stop the madness: Republicans needed to abandon their planned revisions to the Hyde language, while Democrats had to refrain from trying to remove it altogether.                    The abortion issue does not lend itself well to compromise, since neither side views the other as legitimate. But the original Hyde language, like it or not, was a kind of compromise. It was the price of peace. It allowed Congress to pass necessary federal spending bills, including a lot of important legislation completely unrelated to abortion.                    The coming US Supreme Court ruling on abortion could change everything, in law and in policy. A leaked draft opinion last week showed that the high court could be poised to overturn Roe v. Wade and upend five decades of precedent on abortion. Now, state and federal lawmakers who pursue policy around abortion and reproductive health know that their actions would have real consequences, rather than merely being legislative theater.                   According to a Pew poll released prior to the leaked opinion, while most Americans believe abortion should be legal under all or most circumstances, significant numbers support some restrictions or limitations. The poll speaks to the uneasiness many Americans on both sides of the issue experience.                    On one hand, most Americans want abortion to be, in the words of former President Bill Clinton, safe, legal and rare. On the other hand, many of those same Americans want some limitations on the procedure after viability and prohibitions on public funding consistent with the Hyde Amendment.                   If the Supreme Court does, in fact, overturn or substantially curtail Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood, the GOP will be unprepared to deal with the political fallout. For now, Republicans are focusing their messaging on the leaked opinion rather than the substance of the ruling itself, which suggests and reflects an underlying fear to address the many impending and complex policy ramifications and questions.                    The practical effect of Roe being overturned is that by returning abortion policy to the states, in at least 13 of those states abortion will be illegal in most cases. It will remain legal in many other states, while in still others, the legal status of abortion may be considerably less clear.                      Expect chaos and an avalanche of restrictive and permissive abortion legislation at both the state and federal levels by Republicans and Democrats, respectively.                     Less than one year after the Texas bounty payment law was enacted, the Republican-controlled legislature in Louisiana already is advancing a draconian bill criminalizing women who have abortions as well as the doctors who perform them and opponents argue it goes further than that, also criminalizing in vitro fertilization and potentially some forms of contraception.                    Meanwhile, Democrats in Congress are currently attempting to enact a measure enshrining some form of Roe v. Wade into federal law. Some will argue that the Democratic proposal under consideration in Congress goes beyond current law. Democratically controlled states will likely enact laws that go even further.                   A whole host of policy questions and prescriptions will be raised. How will lawmakers deal with emergency contraception  the morning after pill  and medication abortion, like mifepristone, also known as RU-486? Will such medications be permitted to be mailed from states or foreign countries to women choosing to prevent or terminate a pregnancy in states where abortion is illegal?                     Absent Roe, a Democratic Congress will attempt to establish legal abortion in federal law over the objections of states that outlaw abortion in most or all cases. Conversely, its possible that a Republican controlled Congress will attempt to prohibit and criminalize abortion over the objections of states that permit it in most or all cases.        Hear these anonymous CNN viewers share their personal stories and opinions of abortion               And then there are the states, which will be empowered to write 50 separate laws controlling reproductive health and abortion matters. Undoubtedly, states will address the same issues as Congress on abortion and the opportunities for legislative mischief are too numerous to mention.                    Perhaps the biggest change will be the underlying dynamics that drive abortion politics. As long as Roe remains the law of the land, pro-choice proponents will push back against what has been for 50 years an energized, motivated and angered pro-life m",3,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CNNNews_46,"             Abortions have increased substantially in most states where they remain legal post-Dobbs, according to a new analysis. The increases have been particularly significant in states bordering others with bans, suggesting widespread travel for care.                   The Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on sexual and reproductive health that supports abortion rights, launched a new dashboard Thursday that estimates the number of abortions provided in the United States each month. The estimates are based on a regular survey of a core set of providers and broadened to the state level using a model that also factors in historical trends. The latest findings compare the number of abortions provided in the first half of 2023 to a comparable period in 2020.        Nearly two years after Texas six-week abortion ban, more infants are dying               New Mexico and Wyoming had the largest increase in abortions, with more than three times as many provided in the first half of 2023 compared with 2020. The number of abortions also more than doubled in Kansas and South Carolina in that time.                   Overall, the data suggests that there were thousands more abortions in the states where the procedure remained legal in the first half of 2023 than there were nationwide during six months of 2020  up from about 465,000 to nearly 511,000.                   However, the new data is based on a model with a broader margin of error than counts from earlier years, making national estimates less certain. Estimates from the Guttmacher Institute represent abortions provided within formal health care settings, including in-person clinics and telehealth. Estimates do not include data on self-managed abortions, such medication abortion provided by AidAccess.                   Caitlin Myers, a professor of economics at Middlebury College, told CNN that she was not particularly surprised by the increase in abortions.                   People seeking abortions are pouring out of states with restrictions, said Myers, who has researched abortion trends but was not involved in the new analysis. And there are states where abortion access has actually expanded in the wake of Dobbs as people, in particular, have become more aware of and available to access telehealth.                   What we know is that many people are managing to get out of ban states, but that doesnt mean its easy, she said. We are seeing an increase in abortions, but we expect they would have increased even more if it werent for the fact that these bans are trapping some populations, particularly poor populations, in banned states.                   However, not all of the increases can be directly attributed to changes that resulted from the US Supreme Courts Dobbs decision last year, said lsaac Maddow-Zimet, a data scientist with the Guttmacher Institute and lead for the new project. The Covid-19 pandemic may have affected individual attitudes toward pregnancy, and expanded access to medication abortion through telehealth could have affected trends, among other factors.                   ??The need for abortion does not change because legality has shifted,?? said Dr. Jamila?Perritt, an ob/gyn and president and CEO of the advocacy group Physicians for Reproductive Health.                   ??When we talk about these abortion numbers, it can??t be in a vacuum,?? said Perritt, who was not involved in the new analysis. ??It has to be across this larger arc of understanding the implications of restricting reproductive health care and access to that care for the last several decades",5,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CNNNews_47,"             The officials want to be prepared, in case US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryks decision to suspend the US Food and Drug Administrations approval of mifepristone goes through, so medication abortions would still be available in their states for some period of time. But theyre taking different approaches to the idea.        There were 32,000 fewer legal abortions in the US in the six months after the Dobbs decision, new analysis suggests    New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced Tuesday that her states Department of Health would buy 150,000 doses of misoprostol, the other of the two drugs typically used in a medication abortion.       Misoprostol can be used off-label for an abortion, without mifepristone, but patients often have to use more of it. It would not be covered by the court case, and if Kacsmaryks decision stands, the New York Citys Health Department tweeted, it will change to using this medication only.                   Medication abortion continues to be available at our Sexual Health Clinics and NYC Health + Hospitals locations. Should mifepristone become unavailable, we will continue to make medication abortion accessible to all in NYC by shifting to a misoprostol-only treatment regimen, the tweet said.                    The state says the 150,000 doses should represent a five-year supply of pills.                   Anti-choice extremists have shown that they are not stopping at overturning Roe, and they are working to entirely dismantle our countrys reproductive health care system, including medication abortion and contraception, Hochul said. New York will always be a safe harbor for abortion care, and I am taking action to protect abortion access in our State and continue to lead the nation in defending the right to reproductive autonomy.        Clinics and doctors brace for more restrictions on women's health care after court ruling on abortion drug               California is also stocking up on misoprostol.                   While California still believes Mifepristone is central to the preferred regimen for medication abortion, the State negotiated and purchased an emergency stockpile of Misoprostol in anticipation of Fridays ruling by far-right federal judge Matthew Kacsmaryk to ensure that California remains a safe haven for safe, affordable, and accessible reproductive care, Gov. Gavin Newsoms office said in a release Monday.                   California plans to purchase up to 2 million pills through CalRx, a state initiative set up to make drugs more affordable.                    The governors office said the state now has more than 250,000 pills on hand, which it purchased for about $100,000.                    California said it shared the terms of its purchase agreement with other members of the Reproductive Freedom Alliance, a nonpartisan coalition of 21 governors who are committed to protecting reproductive rights, and who might also be interested in taking such action.                   Another member of that alliance, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, announced last week that his state bought a three year-supply of mifepristone, the drug at the center of Kacsmaryks ruling.                    Inslee directed the state Department of Corrections  which has a pharmacy license and is legally able to buy medications  to buy the drug last month, he said, and the shipment was delivered March 31. The University of Washington also purchased 10,000 doses.                    Lawmakers are introducing a bill to authorize officials to distribute or sell the medication to licensed providers throughout the state.                   ??This Texas lawsuit is a clear and present danger to patients and providers all across the country.

CNNNews_48,"             Often, the fate of Roe v. Wade looms over the confirmation hearing of any prospective Supreme Court justice. This time feels different. This week, Ketanji Brown Jackson takes questions from the Senate Judiciary Committee as the Supreme Court continues to deliberate whether it will undermine the fundamental right to abortion when it rules on a Mississippi statute that bans abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.                    A number of red states are already counting on a decision reversing Roe. Lawmakers have introduced and sometimes passed another wave of restrictions, all of them unconstitutional under current law. This trend took on particular momentum beginning in 2018, when the Court first had a conservative majority seemingly poised to reverse Roe, conservative lawmakers have introduced laws that violated abortion rights to give the Court a chance to destroy them.                    But what is new is what we can learn from the most recent abortion bans. These are no longer vehicles to bring a challenge to the Supreme Court. The new restrictions offer a preview of what states wish to do when Roe is overturned. Some, like Florida, have hedged, introducing 15-week bans like the one in Mississippi that the Supreme Court is likely to uphold. Others have more clearly tipped their hand, focusing on strategies not only to criminalize abortion but to stop people who can get pregnant from circumventing state bans.                    Missouri captured headlines with two major abortion bills  one intended to stop travel out of state and a second criminalizing the trafficking of abortion drugs. Particularly shocking was a provision that increased the penalty for the use of abortion drugs to treat ectopic pregnancy, which involves the implantation of a fertilized egg outside the uterus. Life-threatening if not treated, ectopic pregnancy never leads to a healthy birth.         Jackson is handing conservatives one key victory               Missed in the justifiable uproar about Missouris ectopic pregnancy provision is the larger question tackled by both Missouri bills: how to enforce criminal abortion bans if states plan to pass them. That is no easy feat. In America, women can travel out of state or order abortion pills online, and according to the Guttmacher Institute, in 2020 medication abortion accounted for over half of US abortions. One answer seems to be to treat the possession or importation of abortion medication as drug trafficking.                   At least if the Missouri bill offers any example, these provisions will reach beyond doctors to criminalize anyone involved in advertising, transport to or support for abortion. And history suggests that a broad category of accomplices can face consequences when abortion is a crime.                    In the late 19th century, when states began criminalizing early abortions, few authorized the punishment of women. Even in those that treated women as accomplices in their own abortions, prosecutors rarely pursued them. But women were forced to testify not only against doctors but also against lovers, friends, and others who helped them get abortions. After the Supreme Court overrules Roe, a new punitive chapter seems set to begin.                    Thats because trafficking has always been a term that conservatives have relied on to ramp up criminal law interventions in the context of public health. Abortion may fall prey to this bait-and-switch.                   The turn to criminal law and punitive measures to address public health issues is not new in and of itself. The war on drugs, declared by President Richard Nixon in 1971, offers a powerful example of a challenge facing individuals and communities that could have been solved with public health interventions. Nixon had signed the Controlled Substances Act into law a year before, and he oversaw the creation of the Drug Enforcement Agency in 1973, but in the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan expanded many of Nixon??s policies.         MS Gov vows to enforce near-total abortion ban if Roe is overturnedTapper presses GOP governor on Mississippi abortion ban -- full interview               Instead of funding social services from health care to housing, the Reagan administration poured millions of dollars into incarcerating people who used drugs. This contributed not only to poor public health outcomes but also to the phenomenon we now recognize a racialized system of mass incarceration, condemned by those on the right and left alike. The war on drugs also led to the criminalization of harm-reduction measures, including the distribution of clean needles, that have been cast as aiding and abetting in the crime of drug use.                    The law in Missouri mimics these moves from the war on drugs in its emphasis on being punitive rather than reducing harm. The Missour",1,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CNNNews_49,"             All eyes were on Ohio as the only state that directly voted on abortion this election cycle. On Nov. 7,?Ohio?voters decided to establish a constitutional right to abortion. This decision overrides a heartbeat bill banning abortion at about six weeks of pregnancy that has so far been blocked by an injunction while litigation continues.

CNNNews_50,"             A woman turned away with an ectopic pregnancy. A miscarrying mother sent home, where she develops an infection. People with severe pregnancy complications left untreated. Within a month of the Supreme Courts decision overturning Roe v. Wade, abortion bans have thrown emergency care into disarray and put doctors in an impossible bind.                    Federal law requires physicians to treat pregnant patients in emergencies, providing abortions when necessary, while the law in some states prohibits emergency abortions. A showdown between the federal government and the states is now brewing. The state of Texas is suing the Biden administration to block federal guidance that protects access to emergency abortion care, even in states where abortion is a crime. And on Tuesday, the administration went on the offensive, suing Idaho over its abortion restrictions.                   At the heart of both lawsuits is a nearly 40-year-old federal statute, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, known as EMTALA. The law assures that everyone who shows up at the emergency room gets checked out. And if the hospital finds the patient has an emergency medical condition, it has to stabilize them  meaning the patients condition wont worsen when theyre discharged. That includes laboring patients, for whom EMTALA guarantees protection.                   After the Supreme Court overturned Roe in Dobbs v. Jacksons Womens Health Organization, the federal government reminded hospitals that emergency care of pregnant people sometimes requires abortion. Stabilizing treatment may call for dilation and curettage (D&C), a common abortion procedure, or methotrexate, a drug used for conditions like pain and inflammation thats also commonly used to end ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage.                   Doctors could rest easy, the US government said, knowing federal law would protect their clinical judgment: When a state law prohibits abortion and does not include an exception for the life and health of the pregnant person  or draws the exception more narrowly than EMTALAs emergency medical condition definition  that state law is preempted.                    But the Texas attorney general has asked a federal court to declare this guidance unlawful. Under the US Constitution, federal law is supreme over conflicting state laws. But here, the state argues, EMTALA doesnt require any specific kind of care, so there is no conflict. Abortion, it says, is left to state law.         Opinion: These are the gray areas for women's privacy now in a post-Roe world               Texass ban, set to go in effect at the end of August, prohibits all abortions unless a woman has a life-threatening physical condition arising from a pregnancy that places her at risk of death or poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function unless the abortion is performed. That means in some emergency situations, there wont be a conflict between the federal statute and near-total abortion bans. For example, it may be reasonably clear that a pregnant woman critically ill with heart failure has the sort of life-threatening condition that permits abortion under Texas law. Where a woman is at deaths door, then Texass life exception would apply.                    But Texas law prohibits abortion in any emergency that falls short of a life-threatening condition that seriously risks a major bodily function. This means that women miscarrying before fetal viability have to be turned away, unless and until their lives are immediately in danger. Patients with preterm premature rupture of membranes have been denied pregnancy termination, and been injured as a result. Hospitals will be stuck between the federal mandate to treat and the vagueness of state law that threatens criminal charges for abortion care. The Texas ban permits doctors to intervene in a narrow range of emergencies, but its language is unclear. When is a risk serious? Which bodily functions are major?                    In some cases, the federal mandate and the state ban will collide head-on. EMTALA tells doctors to act to avoid serious jeopardy to a pregnant persons health, or potentially face administrative fines or exclusion from Medicare. Texas law warns that doctors might go to prison if they go beyond the narrow exceptions of the criminal ban.         Opinion: The Kansas abortion vote should never have happened               These are not hypotheticals. Some pregnant people develop kidney inflammation or heart enlargement, serious health risks that may not rise to the level of death or substantial impairment of a major bodily function. Hospitals frequently see patients experiencing premature rupture of membranes or miscarriage. While EMTALA could require that doctors offer to terminate those pregnancies, even if fetal cardiac activity can still be detected, Texas law would demand that doctors wait until the pregnant patient risks death or loss of major bodily function.                   The conflict between Texas and the Biden administration over emergency care may be just the tip of the iceberg because anti-abortion leaders increasingly argue that there is no such thing as a medically necessary abortion. There had always been some suspicion of health-based exceptions: The more broadly a law protected patient health, the more anti-abortion leaders worried that exceptions would allow people to have abortions for any reason. Thats why exceptions from abortion restrictions for health, once commonplace, are not found in many recent bills.                   And consensus about life-saving exceptions has also collapsed within the anti-abortion movement. In the 1990s, anti-abortion groups developed a deep distrust of leading medical organizations after fighting for statutes warning that abortion increased the risk of breast cancer, infertility and post-traumatic stress disorder. When peer-review research debunked those arguments and mainstream medical groups rejected them, anti-abortion leaders responded that these organizations were simply biased.                   Battles over global public health led to anti-abortion hostility toward life-saving exceptions. The United Nations Millennium Development Goals, set in 2000, prioritized the reduction of maternal mortality. Seven years later, the World Health Organization established that at least 13% of maternal deaths worldwide were attributable to unsafe abortion, and supporters of reproductive justice argued that access to safe abortion was a crucial step in saving the lives of pregnant people.

CNNNews_51,"             A college student in New York with the dream of working in public health, Schurrs life came to a grinding halt when she discovered she became pregnant as a result of the assault in 2014.                   My pregnancy couldnt have been more unplanned or unwanted  it resulted from an encounter that I didnt want to have and asked to stop, Schurr told CNN.                   Abortion felt like her only option. But Schurr, raised in a conservative Catholic household, was terrified of what that meant.                   I was afraid to rely on just Planned Parenthoods information  because I had been told my whole life how biased they were, and how they only provided abortion services for profit, Schurr said, referring to the falsehoods pushed against the nonprofit sexual and reproductive health care provider that offers abortion services.        Abortion access under renewed threat in Oklahoma and Missouri                But scrolling through websites of crisis pregnancy centers, which sometimes rely on misinformation to dissuade women from having abortions, only scared her more. Ultimately, Schurrs doctor referred her to a Planned Parenthood clinic.                   I was free to make my choice without hesitation or barriers just because I was lucky enough to live in the NYC metro area, said Schurr, who now works as an administrative assistant for the reproductive rights think tank Guttmacher Institute.                   The freedom to make that choice is something many Americans dont have; one people like Schurr are fighting for.                   Republican-majority legislatures  including those in Oklahoma, Idaho and Arizona  have passed a flurry of new restrictions on abortion in recent weeks. They range from limiting access to abortion to making it a felony to perform or attempt to perform the procedure. In many of these cases, the legislation does not provide exceptions in cases of rape, incest or medical emergency.                   In December, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments on one of its most important cases in decades  one that is considered to carry the future of abortion rights in the United States in the balance. A final ruling is expected in June.                    A decision that overturns current Supreme Court precedent on abortion rights  and one that specifically reverses the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade opinion  could lead to new bans on abortions being implemented, and existing bans being upheld in states across the country.                    Proponents of such legislation often invoke religious doctrine and values, viewing abortion as tantamount to murder. But abortion rights activists say the decision whether or not to give birth is personal and enshrined in civil liberties. They also say abortion access can save lives.                   Abortion is a human right, Schurr said. The political attacks on our fundamental right to abortion  the right to bodily autonomy, the right to chart our own course in life, the right to protect our health and well-being  are grossly unconstitutional, immoral, disgraceful and pathetic.                    While protests for abortion rights often come in the form of rallies, donations and political action, theres another weapon some are wielding: their stories.                   In 2015, after Republicans in Congress attempted to defund Planned Parenthood, Amelia Bonow took to Facebook with her own abortion story. Inspired to tell the truth, she shared her experience with no sadness, shame or regret.                    Her Facebook post was shared by fellow feminist and social justice activist Lindy West, who added the hashtag #ShoutYourAbortion. Within days, the hashtag went viral, with thousands of women nationwide adding their own stories.                   The goal of the social media campaign, Bonow told CNN, was to create ways for people to share their abortion stories and normalizing abortion in culture at large.                   Now, Shout Your Abortion (SYA), a nonprofit abortion rights organization co-founded by Bonow and West, shares thousands of stories from people of all ages, races and gender identities.                    We are out here. We are having abortions, and we are talking about them, at whatever volume we choose,?? the Shout Your Abortion website says. ??It??s time for us to take back our own stories.??                   Despite the controversy surrounding abortion, it is a common health intervention in the United States, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Six out of 10 of all unexpected pregnancies end in abortion, WHO reported in 2021.                   About one in four American women will have an abortion by the age of 45, according to the Guttmacher Institute.                    But because ab",7,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CNNNews_52,"             Some 2,200 infants died in Texas in 2022  an increase of 227 deaths, or 11.5%, over the previous year, according to preliminary infant mortality data from the Texas Department of State Health Services that CNN obtained through a public records request. Infant deaths caused by severe genetic and birth defects rose by 21.6%. That spike reversed a nearly decade-long decline. Between 2014 and 2021, infant deaths had fallen by nearly 15%.                    In 2021, Texas banned abortions beyond six weeks of pregnancy. When the Supreme Court overturned federal abortion rights the following summer, a trigger law in the state banned all abortions other than those intended to protect the life of the mother.                    The increase in deaths could partly be explained by the fact that more babies are being born in Texas. One recent report found that in the final nine months of 2022, the state saw nearly 10,000 more births than expected prior to its abortion ban  an estimated 3% increase.                    But multiple obstetrician-gynecologists who focus on high-risk pregnancies told CNN that Texas strict abortion laws likely contributed to the uptick in infant deaths.          Texas sued by women who say state's abortion bans put their health at risk               We all knew the infant mortality rate would go up, because many of these terminations were for pregnancies that dont turn into healthy normal kids, said Dr. Erika Werner, the chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Tufts Medical Center. Its exactly what we all were concerned about.                     The issue of forcing women to carry out terminal and often high-risk pregnancies is at the core of a lawsuit filed by the Center for Reproductive Rights, with several women  who suffered difficult pregnancies or infant deaths shortly after giving birth  testifying in Travis County court this week.                    One witness became so emotional while testifying Wednesday that she began to vomit on the stand.                    After the court called a recess she explained that the reaction is a response to the emotional trauma she endured: I vomit when theres certain parts that happen that kind of just makes my body remember.                   Another sobbed as she described feeling afraid to visit a Texas doctor after receiving an abortion out of state. A third spoke tearfully about waiting for her babys heart to stop beating so her doctors could provide an abortion she desperately needed.                   Prior to the recent abortion restrictions, Texas banned the procedure after 20 weeks. This law gave parents more time to learn crucial information about a fetuss brain formation and organ development, which doctors begin to test for at around 15 weeks.                    Samantha Casiano, a plaintiff in the suit filed against Texas, wished shed had more time to make the decision.                   If I was able to get the abortion with that time, I think it would have meant a lot to me because my daughter wouldnt have suffered, Casiano told CNN after testifying Wednesday.                   When Casiano was 20 weeks pregnant, a routine scan came back with devastating news: Her baby would be stillborn or die shortly after birth.                   The fetus had anencephaly, a rare birth defect that keeps the brain and skull from developing during pregnancy. Babies with this condition are often stillborn, though they sometimes live a few hours or days. Many women around the country who face the prospect choose abortion,  two obstetrician-gynecologists told CNN.                    But Casiano lived in Texas, where state legislators had recently banned most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. She couldnt afford to travel out of the state for the procedure.                     You have no options. You will have to go through with your pregnancy, Casianos doctor told her, she claimed in the lawsuit.                    In March, Casiano gave birth to her daughter Halo. After gasping for air for four hours, the baby died, Casiano said during her testimony on Wednesday.                    All she could do was fight to try to get air. I had to watch my daughter go from being pink to red to purple. From being warm to cold, said Casiano. I just kept telling myself and my baby that Im so sorry that this had to happen to you.                     Casiano and 14 others  including two doctors  are plaintiffs in the lawsuit. They allege the abortion ban has denied them or their patients access to necessary obstetrical care. The plaintiffs are asking the courts to clarify when doctors can make medical exceptions to the states ban.                   Casiano and two other plaintiffs testified Wednesday about hoping to deliver healthy babies but instead learning their lives or pregnancies were in danger.                    ??This was just supposed to be a scan day,?? Casiano told the court. ??It escalated to me finding out my daughter was going to die.??                     Lawyers representing the state argued Wednesday that the plaintiffs?? doctors were to blame, saying they misinterpreted the law and failed to ",4,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CNNNews_53,"             The Supreme Court on Friday reversed Roe v. Wade, the 50-year-old court precedent enshrining a right to abortion.                   Doing so now gives state lawmakers the green light to aggressively limit or ban abortion.                   Since a draft for Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization was leaked last month, CNN readers have asked hundreds of questions about what a reversal of the Supreme Courts abortion rights precedents would mean and how it will affect access to the procedure. The final decision released Friday closely tracked the leaked draft.                   Were reading as many questions as we can and answering some of the most popular here.       Is the Supreme Court actually overturning the law or merely saying the decision belongs with each states law?               The Supreme Court overturned previous court precedent that preempted state laws banning abortion before the fetus is viable, a point around 23 weeks into the pregnancy. In overturning the Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood decisions, the Supreme Court allows states to pursue bans and other restrictions on pre-viability abortion.                   The ruling will not have the effect of banning abortion nationwide. According to the logic expressed in the draft decision (and with the caveat that it can still be changed before the final opinion comes out), the question of abortion policy would then go to state and local lawmakers  and potentially federal lawmakers as well.       Will women get arrested for having an abortion if the Supreme Court deems it illegal?               An abortion-seekers criminal liability will depend on the abortion policies that her state put into place.                    Leaders of the anti-abortion movement have said in the past that women shouldnt be prosecuted for obtaining abortion, and that criminal laws prohibiting it should be aimed at abortion providers or others who facilitate the procedure. Several states with abortion prohibitions that would go into effect with a Roe reversal have language exempting from prosecution the woman who obtained the abortion, but an abortion ban in Wyoming appears to muddle this question with its reference to the pregnant woman in the relevant code.                   Theres also nothing to stop lawmakers from passing laws calling for the prosecution of the people who sought the abortion. A state legislator in Louisiana recently proposed a bill that would charge women with murder for obtaining abortion, though that bill failed to advance. Critics of the anti-abortion movement also note that, even with Roe on the books, women have been prosecuted for pregnancies that ended in miscarriage or stillbirth.       What methods do lawmakers propose to enforce these laws? What can they legally do to find out if someone is pregnant?               The state abortion prohibitions that will go into effect with the Roe reversal dont spell out specific enforcement tactics. The lengths local prosecutors will go to enforce abortion restrictions is very much an unanswered question. Before Roe, the aggressiveness of the enforcement of abortion bans often depended on the political environment, including the local environment that prosecutors were navigating. Now, some prosecutors in Democratic-leaning jurisdictions are vowing to not bring criminal charges under abortion restrictions that go into effect with the new Supreme Court opinion.                   The information the prosecutors will seek from health care providers in order to enforce abortion bans IS very much a concern for reproductive rights advocates. HIPAA protections that typically shield an individuals medical information from disclosure have exemptions for certain law enforcement contexts that may come into play if Roe is overturned. Likewise, there are concerns that the data that can be obtained from an abortion-seekers digital devices may be used to determine if she obtained an abortion. That could include information about her menstrual cycle in a period-tracking application, some fear, or search terms she uses for internet searches.       Based on the legal arguments contained in the leaked draft opinion, are there any other legal precedents and SCOTUS opinions that this ruling would overturn beyond Roe v Wade? What further rights and privileges could be at risk of being scaled back if the draft becomes the law of the land?               The draft Dobbs opinion  if it became the courts formal ruling  wouldnt overturn other closely watched precedents in areas like same-sex marriage, contraception and interracial marriage. Those cases, like abortion, are grounded in a right to privacy that is not explicitly laid out in the Constitution, but that the court has said is implied. The Supreme Court, in handing down Roe and its successor Casey, tied the right to an abortion to the precedents in 1965s Griswold v. Connecticut and 1967s Loving v. Virginia, which struck down state restrictions on contraceptives and interracial marriage, respectively. The 2003 Lawrence v. Texas ruling invalidating Texas anti-sodomy law and the 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide relied on Loving and Griswold as well.                   In the Dobbs draft that leaked, Alito went out of his way in his draft to describe Roe as distinct from those other rulings grounded in a right to privacy because, he wrote, Abortion destroys&potential life.                   None of the other decisions cited by Roe and Casey involved the critical moral question posed by abortion. They are therefore inapposite, Alito wrote. They do not support the right to obtain an abortion, and by the same token, our conclusion that the Constitution does not confer such a right does not undermine them in any way.                   Still, skeptics see the Roe reversal as opening the door to challenges to those other precedents, with Obergefell being the most vulnerable. Alito himself wrote a dissent to the 2015 ruling that argued that The Constitution says nothing about a right to same-sex marriage, but the Court holds that the term liberty in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment encompasses this right.       Conservative lawmakers and legal advocates have also argued the courts Obergefell precedent makes the same errors the court made in enshrining abortion rights.       The Mississippi law at issue bans abortion starting from 15 weeks after the last menstrual period. If the Supreme Court allows this law to stand, will it then be legal to ban abortion at earlier points in pregnancy? Will it be possible for states to ban medication-induced first-trimester abortions, which are the most common type? Many states seem poised to do so.               If the draft opinion that was leaked was adopted, not only would the Mississippi 15-week ban be upheld, but states  and potentially the federal government  would be allowed to ban abortion earlier in the pregnancy, including medication-induced first trimester abortions. More than a dozen states have so-called trigger laws, under which bans on abortion would be implemented if the Supreme Court overturns Roe, and several more have other types of bans that could go into effect with the reversal of previous Supreme Court precedent.                    But until the court issues its final opinion, we wont know for sure how aggressively states will be allowed to restrict abortion under the courts new precedent.        In the event of rape or incest or even underage pregnancy of say 14 years old, where does the law lie for these individuals if Roe vs Wade is overturned?                If Roe is overturned, exemptions in abortion bans for rape, incest or health of the mother will vary state by state. In the wave of abortion limits that have been passed by state legislatures recently in anticipation of the Supreme Courts ruling, only a few of the proposals included exemptions for rape and incest.                     Its a question lawmakers will likely revisit once the Supreme Courts ruling, assuming it overturns Roe, is handed down. While previewing plans to call a special legislative session once the opinion is issued, Republican South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said he opposed rape or incest exemptions. The six-week ban he signed into law last year  which is currently blocked by court order  included those exemptions.                    On the flip side, Arkansas Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson told CNN this May that he supported adding rape and incest exemptions in the trigger law currently on the books in the state.        How are in vitro fertilizations defined? If a state defines the fertilized egg as a human with rights, then if a doctor fertilizes four eggs, but does [not] implant all four in a woman, is that homicide?                What a Roe reversal would mean for fertility treatments is a major uncertainty.                   Physicians and legal experts in the field are currently grappling with state abortion policies frame their laws around the moment of fertilization, when the egg has united with the sperm. Some of those state laws have language that would appear to exempt the disposal of unused embryos created for IVF, but that language doesn??t necessarily exempt the process of selective reduction, when a woman whose fertility treatments lead to a multiple pregnancy has one or more of those fetuses terminated to protect the viability of the other fetuses and/or the health of the mother. More broadly, fertility law experts raise concerns about how a Roe reversal will embolden lawmakers to regulate IVF procedures ?C which have been largely shielded from the abortion debate because of the protections of Roe.

The high court overturned the constitutional right to abortion in 2022,?leaving regulation of the procedure to individual states.                   For now, access to mifepristone, the drug at the center of the case and the first drug in the medication abortion process, remains unchanged.                   Data analyzed by CNN shows mifepristone is even safer than some common, low-risk prescription drugs, including penicillin and Viagra. There were five deaths associated with mifepristone use for every 1 million people in the US who have used the drug since its approval in 2000, according to the US Food and Drug Administration as of last summer. Thats a death rate of 0.0005%.                   Comparatively, the risk of death by penicillin  a common antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections like pneumonia  is four times greater than it is for mifepristone, according to a study on life-threatening allergic reactions. Risk of death by taking Viagra  used to treat erectile dysfunction  is nearly 10 times greater, according to a study cited in the amicus brief filed by the FDA.                   [Mifepristone] has been used for over 20 years by over five million people with the capacity to become pregnant, said Ushma Upadhyay, an associate professor in the department of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive science at the University of California, San Francisco. Its safety is very well established.                   The courts disregard for well-established scientific facts in favor of speculative allegations and ideological assertions will cause harm to our patients and undermines the health of the nation, said Dr. Jack Resneck, Jr., president of the American Medical Association, in a statement in April. By rejecting medical facts, the court has intruded into the exam room and has intervened in decisions that belong to patients and physicians.                   Medication abortion has become the most common method for abortion, accounting for more than half of all US abortions in 2021, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

CAHN: Increasingly, tech companies know every place we go, everything weve searched for online and almost every moment of how our lives are spent.                    It is an incredibly invasive and intimate way to reconstruct our lives, whether thats to figure out what advertisers want to sell us or increasingly for police to try to investigate us.       WHAT MATTERS: The fear is this information could be used in abortion prosecutions, if those start happening. How is it currently used in the justice system?    CAHN: In 2022, electronic surveillance and device searches are an everyday part of American policing. Officers submit warrants to Google by the tens of thousands. & Nearly every app on our phone is collecting information that can potentially be used.                    And even companies like Apple, which spend millions of dollars advertising privacy protections, oftentimes are completely unable to protect their users if they get a court order.                    With abortion prosecutions, were not afraid of something unprecedented. Were afraid of something that is already happening, simply accelerated, and we already see examples of pregnant people being targeted by police and prosecutors because of electronic information.       WHAT MATTERS: It seems to me like communications  text messages and phone calls  would be a bigger tool for prosecutors if they were going after somebody seeking an abortion or somebody helping facilitate one. Is that a separate issue, or is that wrapped up into this?   CAHN: Oh, thats all part of a threat modeling here. When we look at the constellation of risks, some of it comes from scraping massive amounts of data from Google, from social media companies and even from Apple. But a large part of it is simply looking at the text messages we send.                    We continue to see people being reported to police by family, by friends, for seeking abortion services. Its quite common in American courtrooms to see emails, text messages, even encrypted messages being read back into the transcript to be used against us.                    Encrypting your communications can help reduce the risk, but you know, using the most secure platforms like Signal and also setting up messages to automatically delete is an even more effective safeguard.       WHAT MATTERS: From your report, I learned about the importance of non-state actors. You talked about family members informing on people and activists tracking license plates. Its not my impression that in states that ban abortion there will be an abortion police out there actively searching for this. It takes these activist groups to tee it up. Is that right? Or is that a misread?   CAHN: I think that it is both. So I think thats correct today, but I fear that we will see designated abortion policing units in the future. Certainly during Roe, even in its waning days, we saw states relying extensively on private bounty hunters and activists to enforce abortion bans.                    Famously in the case of SB 8 in Texas, the state turned to private companies, because it was unconstitutional under Roe for them to engage in that sort of anti-abortion policing themselves.                    But its unclear in a world where the police can prosecute those seeking care directly whether well see less of a focus on those private bounty hunters and private activist groups.       WHAT MATTERS: Google has said it will soon begin to delete data for visits to abortion clinics and health care locations. Is that a step in the right direction? Is that something to be celebrated, or is it nothing at all?   CAHN: This is far too little, far too late. Google has been warned that the way they are storing data poses a threat to civil rights for years.                    And while we are all talking about the threat to abortion care right now, this also poses a threat to political protest, it poses a threat to freedom of religion, freedom of assembly  almost any right that we use.                    In fact, almost any right that we exercise by coming together in a single place can be forever chilled by these sorts of warrants. And its not hypothetical. We saw Minneapolis police using a geofence warrant during Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.                    Even by its own terms, Googles approach isnt enough. First off, for people who are providing abortion medication and services in states where its illegal, theyre not about to publicize to Google that they qualify as a health care facility. So Google wouldnt even know to redact the information from that location.                    And then second of all, even if they are redacting information from the clinic itself, you can still gain a lot of information by tracking someones movements in other areas, particularly if people are traveling out of state long distances.                    So rather than saying that we should only have our privacy in select locations, Google should say that every place should be a safe place.       WHAT MATTERS: President Joe Biden signed an executive order intended to protect abortion access, and the Federal Trade Commission has issued a warning to tech companies to protect data. Is that a step in the right direction?   CAHN: It is. Id like to see much more aggressive action by the Biden administration.                    We should be stripping federal law enforcement funds from police departments that abuse these tools to target abortion access  particularly right now, we see a lot of concern about how abortion laws are going to be enforced across state lines.         Biden signs executive order aimed at safeguarding abortion rights               With pregnant people going to states like New York and Illinois to find care, theres going to be a rush by anti-choice states to track those movements using geofence warrants, and to try to use truly unprecedented law to enforce their abortion bans across state lines.                    The President has a lot more power to disrupt this sort of activity, whether its adding conditions to DOJ grants under the Byrne Discretionary Grant Program, whether its an executive order that this interferes with the right to travel, whether its suspending membership in Joint Terrorism Task Forces and other federal-state information sharing agreements for any agency that does this.                    You know, there are huge pots of money at the federal level, funding state and local police, and none of that money should be funding attacks on abortion access.       WHAT MATTERS: The idea that there??s a need for a digital privacy law is not new. How will overturning Roe affect what should go into that law? And are you hopeful that there will be a new law in the near future?   CAHN: I think there will be many laws that go far further than would have seemed possible not long ago, but they won??t be federal. They??ll be state and local.                    We??ve seen this stalemate on privacy for years at the federal level, and layering on the impact that these protections have for abortion will only polarize it further.                    But we can see states like New York poised to enact really groundbreaking protections. We have the first bill pending in the country that will ban all geofence warrants, keyword warrants and police purchases of similar data. And that bill has been gaining moment",2,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CNNNews_56,"             Nearly one year after the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, a new rule has solidified in American politics: no abortion access in the American South. And until recently, that rule had three increasingly visible exceptions  states which, unsurprisingly, became destinations for abortion seekers from across the region.                   Florida saw the single greatest increase  reportedly 1,200 patients a month  after Dobbs. North Carolina, another receiving state, had seen a nearly 40% increase. After the South Carolina Supreme Court struck down that states abortion law in January, that state also saw a sharp increase in abortions, with roughly half of patients coming from out of state.                   It seems that there wont be exceptions to the rule for much longer. In North Carolina, Republicans recently overrode a veto by the states Democratic governor to pass a law that banned elective abortion at 12 weeks, prohibited medication abortion after 10 weeks and introduced a tough new waiting period that will make it harder for people traveling out of state to seek the procedure.                   The South Carolina House once again passed a ban on abortion at six weeks, before many know they are pregnant, setting up a clash in the state Senate, where five female lawmakers had previously mounted a successful filibuster (the state Supreme Court had struck down a virtually identical law last year, but since the courts composition changed, Republicans are betting that the new court will reverse course). And in Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis, one of the likely frontrunners for the 2024 GOP nomination, signed into law another six-week ban with narrow exceptions (the states ultraconservative Supreme Court is expected to overturn existing precedent and allow the law to go into effect).        Opinion: How this animal welfare victory could threaten abortion rights               For those seeking abortions, or women experiencing life-threatening conditions that may not fit narrow exceptions to abortion bans, the closest option in the South may be Virginia, where Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin is pushing for a ban at 15 weeks, or Washington, DC.                   With travel becoming prohibitively expensive and often complex, this region  known for the nations worst maternal mortality rates  will almost certainly be an even more dangerous place to be pregnant. For some, it comes as no surprise that the South would define itself as an anti-abortion region. But in reality its status as the center of anti-abortion America was not historically inevitable.                   In its early years, the anti-abortion movement had the most influence in Catholic strongholds on the East Coast and Midwest, places that often elected Democrats as well as Republicans. Anti-abortion organizers, then as now, argued that the fetus was an independent person with rights, and that liberal abortion laws were unconstitutional, but they disagreed about how personhood should be enforced, with some calling for harsh punishment of providers and those who helped them, and others equally focused on laws that would make it easier for the economically marginalized to afford to carry pregnancies to term.                   But when the anti-abortion movement aligned itself with the Republican Party in the late 1970s and early 1980s, it started moving south. White evangelical Protestants, who had once been uncomfortable with what they viewed as a Catholic movement, had spoken out about abortion before the late 1970s, but they became more publicly involved in the 1980s, heeding the advice of new organizations in the religious right like Concerned Women for America.        Opinion: The groundbreaking and complicated life of Mildred Fay Jefferson               By the 1990s, conservative Christian law firms, many with ties to Christian Right organizations in the South, opened their doors or expanded considerably. The Alliance Defending Freedom, for example, the group litigating the current challenge to the abortion pill mifepristone, became a sort of mega-funder for anti-abortion litigation.                   Jay Sekulow, an attorney who later represented former president Donald Trump in his impeachment hearings, led the American Center for Law and Justice, a well-funded group launched by televangelist Pat Robertson.                   With new partners and members, the new anti-abortion movement was more comfortable framing its cause as a matter of faith, and more focused on harsh punishment for those perceived to have wronged the unborn child.                   These messages reflected the new influence of Southern activists ?? the South, for example, has long had especially harsh criminal laws and high rates of incarceration, even in a nation with the highest rate of incarceration in the world. In turn, as different leaders took the helm, a focus on punishment resonated with the movement??s rank and file.                   The anti-abortion movement is still complex, with a large Catholic cohort and members from other faith communities or with no faith commitments at all. A growing number of activists seek to require the government to provide limited aid, at least during pregnancy (the group Americans United for Life has launched an initiative to ??make birth free,?? while other anti",2,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CNNNews_57,"             Several states moved to enshrine abortion protections in their constitutions and others rejected proposals to limit abortion access or criminalize doctors in some cases. Democratic lawmakers and organizers cast the midterm elections as a referendum on Republican efforts to limit womens choices, and the notable electoral reaction could serve as a warning sign for future GOP efforts to restrict the procedure at the state-level.                   About 27% of voters cited abortion as the issue most important to them, according to the preliminary results of the national and state exit polls conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research. The results also showed that when it comes to the issue, roughly half of voters said they trusted Democratic candidates, compared with more than 4 in 10 voters who said they trusted Republican candidates.                    This fall, Roe is on the ballot, President Joe Biden declared in a defiant speech from the White House just hours after the Supreme Courts ruling earlier this year.                     While CNN projected some anti-abortion Republicans will win their races, voters in five states moved to affirm abortion rights.                    Heres a running list of what voters decided on Election Day.                   Voters in Montana rejected on Tuesday proposed legislation that would have imposed criminal penalties on health care providers who do not act to preserve the life of infants born during the course of an abortion, CNN projects.                    LR-131, if adopted, would have provided that an infant born alive  defined as an infant at any stage of development who breathes, has a beating heart or definite movement of voluntary muscles after expulsion or extraction  be treated as a legal person entitled to medical treatment.                     A health care provider who violated the proposed law would have been guilty of a felony and could have faced up to 20 years in state prison and/or a fine of up to $50,000. It would have also mandated that health care providers and clinics report a failure to comply with the requirements to law enforcement.                      Montana currently prohibits abortions past viability  the ability of a fetus to live outside the mothers womb  except to save the life or health of the woman.                     Last year, the states Republican-led legislature passed the bill that put the referendum on the ballot.                   Backers of the measure said such a law was necessary to protect infants born during an abortion attempt, while opponents said the bill wasnt needed because there are laws in place that require care to be given.                     Hillary-Anne Crosby, the campaign coordinator and communications lead for Compassion for Montana Families, previously said LR-131 zeroes in on families that are having complications in the labor and delivery room, such as lethal fetal abnormalities.                     Its not uncommon for families to make the decision to induce labor so that they can hold their infant for a few minutes, maybe have family come in and be able to meet their new family member for the few moments that they are alive, and LR-131 throws a wrench in that being a viable option to them without the health care workers facing a felony, she previously told CNN.                       Kentucky voters on Tuesday rejected a proposal to amend the states constitution to say that it does not secure or protect a right to abortion or the funding of abortion, CNN projects.                    The ballot question voters faced read: Are you in favor of amending the Constitution of Kentucky by creating a new Section of the Constitution to be numbered Section 26A to state as follows: To protect human life, nothing in this Constitution shall be construed to secure or protect a right to abortion or require the funding of abortion?          Takeaways from the 2022 midterm elections: Battle for control of the House and Senate still up in the air               Kentuckys trigger law, which bans most abortions at all stages of pregnancy, and a law banning abortion after roughly six weeks of pregnancy have been allowed to be enforced temporarily while a lawsuit challenging the laws continues.                     Kentucky Right to Life executive director Addia Wuchner, who chairs the Yes for Life Alliance, which supported Amendment 2, previously said voting yes would ensure theres no false interpretation of the constitution.                     Without the amendment, instead of the lawmakers who duly reflect the peoples will, we would end up with the abortion industry taking each law back into court, Wuchner said.                     Tamarra Wieder, the Kentucky state director for Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates, had said passing the amendment would open the door to more attacks on abortion access, but rejecting it would allow abortion rights advocates to continue to fight back against the six-week ban and the trigger ban.                     If adopted, the measure would have gone into effect immediately once the results of the election are certified by the State Board of Elections.                    Michigan voters on Tuesday voted to enshrine abortion rights in the states constitution, a move that will help block a decades-old abortion ban from taking effect, CNN projects.                   The passage of ballot Proposal 3 amends the Michigan constitution to establish an individual right to reproductive freedom, including right to make and carry out all decisions about pregnancy.                   Michigan has a 1931 law that essentially bans abortion in the state, but that law is being blocked by the courts. The passage of the ballot proposal helps prevent the ban from taking effect.                   The amendment allows the state to regulate abortion after fetal viability, except if needed to protect a patients life or physical or mental health. It also bars the state from prosecuting an individual for having an abortion or miscarriage or from prosecuting someone who assists a pregnant person in ??exercising rights established by this amendment.??

CNNNews_58,"             Congress has the chance to enact groundbreaking legislation, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA), that would close a dangerous gap in protections for pregnant workers.                     Without this bill, employers can discriminate against pregnant workers who need common-sense help, denying them exemptions from heavy lifting, as well as bathroom or water breaks  sometimes at the cost of their jobs and health. The PWFA would solve this problem by requiring employers to make reasonable accommodations for pregnant workers that do not impose undue hardship on employers.                    With support from both the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) and the American Civil Liberties Union, the bipartisan PWFA is a legislative unicorn  a bill that Americans who disagree about abortion, like the four of us, can rally behind.         Opinion: The conflicts in a post-Roe America are just beginning               And were not alone. Bipartisan support on the issue reflects the widely shared belief that pregnant workers deserve the accommodations they need. The bill has the votes to pass, and it may be now or never.  But the bill has stalled in the Senate due to disagreements about how it relates to abortion, just as both chambers are set to recess in the coming week. Its not too late, however, for Congress to find a way through this impasse and help pregnant workers.                    Historically, it was commonplace for employers to fire pregnant women. A married womans sphere is in the home, if she has a family, an editorial explained in 1911. Employers assumed that any pregnant worker would (and should) leave the workforce upon becoming a parent. And assumptions about work during and after pregnancy gave workers a zero-sum choice: give up a badly-needed job or find a way to end a pregnancy.                     That is neither pro-life nor pro-choice. It is fundamentally unjust, and yet, the Supreme Court held in the 1970s that pregnancy discrimination was constitutional and did not violate federal civil rights law.                    But that was intolerable to the coalition of pro-choice and pro-life advocates who fought for the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA). Abortion-rights supporters stressed that real reproductive choice involves not just the right not to have a child but also the ability to bear and raise children without sacrificing the means to make a living. Activists opposed to abortion recognized that supporting pregnant workers would mean fewer abortions  and stronger families.     Opinion: It's time for Democrats to take a page from the GOP playbook               The coalition sought through the PDA to reduce economic pressures that might lead to an abortion. Thanks to this unlikely alliance, Congress passed the PDA in 1978, reasoning that the assumption that women will become pregnant and leave the labor market is at the core of the sex stereotyping.                     But in the years since, its become clear that the PDA is broken. As courts interpret the law today, it does not require employers to accommodate anyone  it only demands that employers extend the same protections to pregnant workers that are offered to employees similar in their ability to work. That means employers can avoid problems simply by denying everyone protections.                     Worse, judges commonly shut down claims because an employee cant find a precise enough comparator  an employee similar in ability or inability to work. As the House observed: Forcing pregnant workers to identify a comparator creates an oftentimes insurmountable hurdle.??                     The results for pregnant workers have been devastating. As the New York Times recently documented, pregnancy discrimination harms a range of workers across the pay scale, from Walmart to Wall Street.

CNNNews_59,"             Unborn human being is the term Associate Justice Samuel Alito adopted from the Mississippi statute, thereby replacing the key phrase in the landmark 1973 Roe ruling that spelled out a constitutional right to abortion: potential life.                    It may seem like a semantic argument. Experts say its anything but.                    Alito didnt write God or Christianity or Bible anywhere in the opinion, but his justification is a veiled religious narrative, said Rebecca Todd Peters, a religious studies professor at Elon University. By co-opting the language in Mississippis law in Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization, the majority opinion gives credence to the notion  embraced largely by the religious right  that life begins at fertilization, she said. The ruling has already emboldened several states to ban and criminalize the medical procedure in almost all circumstances.         The force of the Supreme Court's right turn has shaken the country               That is an enormous shift, Peters said. It erases whole groups of people who have different religious beliefs.                    Peters, who is ordained in the Presbyterian Church, isnt merely speaking about Christians. When a zygote, embryo or fetus becomes a human being is far from an objective determination within or across any religions. There is no scientific gauge: Doctors tend to focus on viability, which experts believe to be around 23 weeks, though health outcomes improve the longer the gestational period. Various religions have relied on a range of wayposts, including fertilization, quickening (when the mother feels the fetus moving), when the embryo develops a heartbeat, ensoulment and birth.                   Confounding matters is that, just like in Christian sects, there are chasms of disagreement among other religions  not only regarding personhood but also a womans bodily autonomy  making holy texts a troublesome barometer for whether abortion should be outlawed. Worse, said Peters, is that by co-opting the term, unborn human being, it signals which religious voices get authority and power in our country.                   Though opponents of legalized abortion often paint women who undergo abortions as heathens, a strong majority  more than 6 in 10  identified as women of faith in a 2014 poll, said Peters, who is on sabbatical for a research project titled, Abortion and Religion: Listening to Women.               There are a whole lot more who support bodily autonomy for mothers to make decisions about life and how many children they have and who they have them with and how to shape their future with or without partners, Peters said. Weve allowed a minority religious belief to curtail the rights of the majority of women in the country. I feel like Im in the middle of a dystopian novel.                   More than 50 religious groups sought to make this clear to the high court last year, filing a friend-of-the-court brief explaining religious traditions have various views of when life begins, affirm a womans moral right to decide when to terminate pregnancy and stand by the importance of ensuring reproductive choice for women in marginalized communities who are disproportionately harmed by the ban.                    By prohibiting abortions beyond 15 weeks gestation, the Ban precludes women from making that choice in accordance with their own moral, spiritual, and religious beliefs, which this Court has recognized as a constitutional right, the brief said.                    The attitude that a woman would have to justify her decision to others is rooted in religion, Peters said. It robs women of their autonomy and espouses a narrow, archaic view of Christianity that has long been malappropriated to dictate women are to be subservient and meant to be child bearers, she said.                   A Gallup poll in May  before Roes reversal  found 55% of Americans identified as pro-choice, while 39% said theyre pro-life. Only 13% of Americans said abortions should be prohibited across the board, and 53% said abortions should be legal in most or all circumstances, Gallup reported.                    Breaking the percentages down by dogma demonstrates only a handful of groups  Jehovahs Witnesses (68%), Mormons (66%) White evangelical Protestants (65%), Hispanic Protestants (58%) and Hispanic Catholics (52%)  count a majority of members as opposing abortion, the nonprofit Public Religion Research Institute found in 2018.                   Catholics have long driven the debate on abortion  and five Catholics and a justice who was raised Catholic upheld Mississippis 15-week ban  even as the institutes data suggests 52% of White Catholics are OK with legal abortion. (It is worth noting Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor broke with her fellow Catholics in Dobbs.)                   Here is a look at support for legal abortion in most or all cases among other religions, per the institute:                    Muslims  51%                   "" Orthodox Christian  54%                   "" Black Protestants  56%                   "" White mainline Protestants  59%                   "" Hindus  62%                   "" Buddhists  69%                   "" Jewish people  70%                   And 87% of agnostics and 97% of atheists expressed support for abortion in all or most cases",7,7,,so to cast attitudes as for or against disappears nuance from the equation. There are other factors to consider,experts say.                   Islamic scholars,for instance,took a more liberal stance in premodern times,said UCLA law professor Khaled Abou El Fadl,an Islamic jurist who holds a doctorate in Islamic law from Princeton University.                    There was a time when women so often miscarried in the first trimester that some jurists didnt regard the fetus as a full human being,while others debated when the soul enters the fetus  somewhere between 40 and 120 days,the professor said. Still,there were some conservative-minded jurists who felt the potentiality of life should always be protected,he said.                    The conversation began to shift during colonialism,with the influence of French law and the creation of state governments,Abou El Fadl said.                    Its interesting because the medieval debate in Islamic law was about when the soul enters the body. We dont have an Islamic text on that  nothing in the Quran,nothing in the inherited traditions of the Prophet Muhammad that answers the question, he said,explaining that once the state became much larger in everyones life and the whole idea (arises) that the state has the right to regulate and enforce morality, most if not all Muslim nations banned abortion except to save the mothers life.         Opinion: Brick by brick,the wall between religion and government is collapsing in America               Judaism takes a similar position on allowing abortion to save the mother. Judaism is a religion that is based on law, and there are no religious figures  no popes or imams  who can allow something Jewish law prohibits,said Dr. Daniel Eisenberg,an expert in Jewish medical ethics and a radiologist at Einstein Medical Center Philadelphia.                   The issue of when life begins is not a Jewish concept,he said. The question is: When does Jewish law protect life? The general consensus is when its necessary to protect a mothers life. Outside that,??the range of opinions is from a Biblically forbidden form of murder without being a capital offense to being a rabbinic prohibition that is very serious but not murder.?? Abortion is never a capital offense in Jewish law,he said.                    ??A fetus is going to become a full-fledged human being,but it is not considered to be a full-fledged human being until it is born. But not being a human being does not mean it??s nothing,?? said Eisenberg,who has spent years studying and lecturing on the Talmud and Jewish law. ??The concept is that the fetus is a person with slightly less protection than a full-fledged human being,than the mother. ?? When it is a threat to the mother," it is subordinate.??      """
CNNNews_60,"             Nancy Davis said she is planning to get an abortion in another state after a Louisiana hospital allegedly chose not to perform the procedure even though her baby was diagnosed with acrania, a rare congenital disorder in which a fetus skull does not form inside of the womb.                    Acrania is a lethal condition with death within the first week of life, according to the Fetal Medicine Foundation.    Abortion is banned or severely limited in a number of states. Here's where things stand               Davis case reflects the confusion and wrenching decisions faced by mothers and health care professionals after the June 24 US Supreme Court ruling to overturn the constitutional right to an abortion.                    Laws that ban abortion or severely restrict the procedure have subsequently gone into effect in about a dozen states  Louisiana among them.                    I want you to imagine what its been like to continue this pregnancy for another six weeks after this diagnosis, Davis said at a news conference on the steps of the Louisiana State Capitol in Baton Rouge. This is not fair to me and it should not happen to any other woman.                    Davis, who said she learned of the babys fatal condition 10 weeks into her pregnancy, was joined at the news conference by the babys father and her attorneys, including Ben Crump.                    The doctors told me that my baby would die shortly after birth, Davis said. They told me that I should terminate the pregnancy.  Because of the state of Louisianas abortion ban they cannot perform the procedure. Basically, they said I had to carry my baby to bury my baby. They seemed confused about the law and afraid of what would happen to them if they perform a criminal abortion, according to the law.                   In a statement last week, a spokesperson for Womans Hospital in Baton Rouge, Caroline Isemann, said the hospital cannot comment on a specific patient but said navigating an unviable pregnancy is extremely complex.        Abortion to be put further out of reach for millions of women as slate of 'trigger bans' take effect               We look at each patients individual circumstances and how to remain in compliance with all current state laws to the best of our ability, Isemann told CNN.                    Even if a specific diagnosis falls under medically futile exceptions provided by (the Louisiana Department of Health), the laws addressing treatment methods are much more complex and seemingly contradictory.??                   Crump called on the state to hold a special session of the Louisiana legislature to address the ??public health catastrophe?? created by ??vague and confusing?? abortion laws.                    The attorney said Louisiana lawmakers have ??inflicted unspeakable pain, emotional damage and physical risk?? by stepping between his client and her doctors. He said other women and healthcare providers will endure a similar plight because state law has ??created an environment of confusion and fear.??           ",,7,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CNNNews_61,"             Mifepristone  a pill used to medically induce abortion in combination with another drug, misoprostol  is approved for use by the US Food and Drug Administration, and some have argued that its federal approval could take precedence over state laws attempting to ban it.                Medication abortion has steadily grown in acceptance since it became an option about 20 years ago and is now used in more than half of abortions, outpacing the aspiration, or surgical, procedure for the first time in 2020, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.         Biden administration says pharmacies can't turn away people who have a prescription for a drug that may end a pregnancy               But medication abortion is not always an appropriate option  sometimes for medical reasons but more often in the context of the individual situation  and experts say its critical to protect access to abortion as broadly as possible.                    Medication abortion is the primary focus of all my research, but Im the first one to say that its not a panacea and cannot be the answer for everyone, said Ushma Upadhyay, an associate professor at the University of California, San Franciscos Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health.                    GenBioPro, the manufacturer of generic mifepristone, lists a few reasons for people to avoid using the abortion pill on their website. They include allergies to the drug, long-term use of steroids for things like autoimmune disorders, and history of a bleeding disorder. Its also not a viable option for the few people who do get pregnant while an IUD is in place.                    Overall, experts say that these clinical exceptions are uncommon.                    It is very rare that medication abortion would be absolutely contraindicated for someone, said Dr. Jen Villavicencio, lead for equity transformation at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.                    Dr. Alice Mark, an abortion provider in Massachusetts and interim medical adviser to the National Abortion Federation, estimates that she has a patient with these considerations only one or two times each year.         Doctors worry that online misinformation will push abortion-seekers toward ineffective, dangerous methods               More restrictive, perhaps, are timing limitations for the drug.                    The FDA has specifically approved mifepristone for use in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy, and the vast majority of abortions happen within this timeframe. Nearly 80% of abortions in the United States in 2019 were performed at nine weeks or earlier, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.                    But there are two main reasons why a person may seek an abortion after the first 10 weeks of pregnancy, Upadhyay said: There is new information learned or barriers to care that prevent earlier action.                    Many people do have delayed recognition of pregnancy, particularly younger people, adolescents, people whove never been pregnant before, she said.                    Otherwise, there might be new knowledge about their health or the health of the fetus, changes to their economic situation or partner relationship, or other new information.         Online abortion pill interest soars after the demise of Roe v. Wade                Even when patients have their minds made up, barriers to access can add delays to the timeline.                    Weve had participants in our research tell us that by the time theyve collected the funding needed to make the trip and to pay for the abortion, they will call the clinic and learn that the price has gone up [with the increased gestational age]. And then they have to spend more time gathering the funds, Upadhyay said.                    These barriers are generally the same that exist across health care more broadly for more disadvantaged populations.                   Although it might be easier to find an abortion provider than a general physician ?C at least before the Supreme Court ruling changed the provider landscape ?C most don??t have the economic resources to fund a ??time-sensitive health emergency,?? said Kirsten Moore, director of the Expanding Medication Abortion Access Project.                   ??There??s a real burden on the patient to put all this together,?? she said. ??I don??t think it??s finding the abortion provider, per se, that??s the challenge. It??s coming up with the resources to actually bring it all together.??        Myths about abortion and women's mental health are widespread, experts say               Clinical considerations aside, experts say that individual preferences and the nuances of each situation mean medication abortion is not right for everyone.

CNNNews_62,"             I started seeing things on social media, things like TikTok, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, people saying oh, if Roe v. Wade does get overturned, here are some secret, sneaky ways that you can drink some tea and have an abortion,  Trebach said.                   Now that Roe v. Wade has been overturned and some states are putting strict limits on abortions, theres widespread confusion about whether the procedures are available and to whom. Physicians and poison control officials say theyre worried that people seeking abortions will turn to ineffective and dangerous methods shared online, potentially delaying or preventing safe, proven abortion care.                    Social media companies told CNN theyre taking a range of actions, including reviewing some abortion-related posts, elevating content from verified sources, and labeling or removing certain posts.                   This type of abortion misinformation is scary, said Trebach, an emergency medicine physician and a medical toxicologist in New York City. Some herbs people described may not do anything at all. Others could have a range of medical effects or even be deadly.        Myths about abortion and women's mental health are widespread, experts say               Trebach said the online posts he saw came from unverified sources and described substances he learned about only in toxicology training. In the US, many herbs and supplements are regulated as food, not drugs, meaning there isnt safety or efficacy data to back their use. Negative effects from an herb cant always be treated easily, he said.                   At the end of the day, nothing  no plant, no herb, no tea, no tincture  is going to be safer or more effective than the current medical standard of abortion, the current medical therapies that we have, he said. Nothing is a fair substitute for that.                   Julie Weber, board chair of the American Association of Poison Control Centers, said centers have not seen an increase in exposure calls about people attempting abortions, but theyre preparing for it. People can call the association at 1-800-222-1222 or reach experts at poisonhelp.org if they have questions about a substance and its potential effects.                   When I hear or start seeing questions on social media, I hear of people talking about alternative medications or herbal products or supplements, I do get concerned, Weber said. And I am concerned with this, and we do want to get that message out there that this is not necessarily a safe alternative or one thats even going to be effective.                    Andrea Miller, president of the advocacy group National Institute for Reproductive Health, has seen abortion misinformation online and said some of it might be coming from well-intentioned people who are outraged and fearful and want to help right now, but they may inadvertently be sharing information that isnt accurate or directing people to nefarious resources without realizing it.                   Miller also worries that some posts may be designed to misinform and confuse.                     There has been a calculated, pernicious misinformation campaign that has been many decades in the making from those who are opposed to reproductive freedom, and we anticipate that that is going to be ratcheted up significantly now, she said.         What is medication abortion, and who has access to it?               One TikTok video  with hashtags such as #womenshealth and #womensrights  listed a range of fruits, herbs and other DIY methods that it claimed could induce abortions. It got more than 244,000 likes before CNN flagged it and it was removed by the platform last week.                   TikTok says its removing videos about abortion that violate its policy against medical misinformation, although it allows other content on the topics, such as videos discussing access to the procedure, according to a spokesperson. The short-form video platform is also redirecting searches for certain hashtags such as #herbalabortion and #naturalabortion to its Community Guidelines rather than showing results.                     Similar posts with misleading, potentially dangerous claims about inducing an abortion have also been shared on Twitter and Facebook, although most appeared to have less reach and engagement than on TikTok.                    A Facebook spokesperson said that posts about abortion may be reviewed by its third-party fact-checking partners, and content that is rated false, altered or partly false by fact checkers will have its distribution reduced. Facebook pages, groups or accounts that repeatedly share content debunked by fact checkers may also have their reach reduced or lose the ability to advertise or monetize, according to the company.                    Two posts listing potentially harmful claims about self-induced abortion that CNN flagged to Facebook had not been labeled by fact checkers, which choose which content to review, as of Wednesday.                   Twitter says it is working to pre-bunk misinformation by elevating reliable sources, including on its Trends and Twitter Moments features, according to a spokesperson. Twitters rules generally do not prohibit discussion of abortion, contraception or related topics; under the platforms misinformation policy, it takes action against misleading information related to Covid-19, civic integrity, synthetic and manipulated media, and crisis situations, but the policy does not mention abortion.                    As of Wednesday, the platform had not labeled or removed several posts flagged by CNN that contained advice on using herbs or large doses of medication that toxicologists said could be ineffective or harmful.                    Miller advises people seeking abortions or information about the procedure to approach the issue in the same way they would any other health concern: That is to make sure that they are seeking it out from reputable sources, or if they think hey, thats an intriguing post, thats an intriguing thing, I might want to check that out,?? make sure to do some additional research if you??re not confident of the source, even if it??s one of your closest friends and you??re not sure where they got it and they??re not sure where it came from.??                   Doctors CNN spoke with said they??re worried that videos containing abortion misinformation imply there are no paths to  legal abortion ?C which could distract from safe, available options and create more confusion.                   ??I feel like nowadays, we are lucky that we do have ve",,5,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CNNNews_63,"             A Chevy abortion would cost about $200, cash in hand, the voice explained. A Cadillac was around $500, and the Rolls Royce was $1,000.                   You cant afford more than the Chevy? Fine, the voice growled. Go to this address at this time. Dont be late and dont forget the cash. The voice disappeared.                    Dorie Barron told CNN she recalls staring blankly at the phone in her hand, startled by the sudden empty tone. Then it hit her: She had just arranged an illegal abortion with the Chicago Mafia.                   The motel Barron was sent to was in an unfamiliar part of Chicago, a scary middle of nowhere, she said. She was told to go to a specific room, sit on the bed and wait. Suddenly three men and a woman came in the door.                    I was petrified. They spoke all of three sentences to me the entire time: Wheres the money? Lie back and do as I tell you. And finally Get in the bathroom, when the abortion was over, Barron said. Then all of a sudden they were gone.                   Bleeding profusely, Barron managed to find a cab to take her home. When the bleeding didnt stop, her bed-ridden mother made her go to the hospital.                   At 24, Barron was taking care of her ailing mother and her 2-year-old daughter when she discovered she was pregnant. Her boyfriend, who had no job and lived with his parents, freaked, said Barron, who appears in a recent HBO documentary. The boyfriend suggested she get an abortion. She had never considered that option.                    But what was I to do? My mom was taking care of my daughter from her bed while I worked  they would read and play games until I got home, Barron said.How was either of us going to cope with a baby?                   Looking back, I realize I was taking my life in my hands, said Barron, now an 81-year-old grandmother. To this day it gives me chills. If I had died, what in Gods green earth would have happened to my mom and daughter?                   Women in the 1960s endured restrictions relatively unknown to women today. The so-called fairer sex could not serve on juries and often could not get an Ivy League education. Women earned about half as much as a man doing the same job and were seldom promoted.                    Women could not get a credit card unless they were married  and then only if their husband co-signed. The same applied to birth control  only the married need apply. More experienced women shared a workaround with the uninitiated: Go to Woolworth, buy a cheap wedding-type ring and wear it to your doctors appointment. And dont forget to smile.                   Marital rape wasnt legally considered rape. And, of course, women had no legal right to terminate a pregnancy until four states  Alaska, Hawaii, New York and Washington  legalized abortion in 1970, three years before Roe v. Wade became the law of the land.                    Illinois had no such protection, said Heather Booth, a lifelong feminist activist and political strategist: Three people discussing having an abortion in Chicago in 1965 was a conspiracy to commit felony murder.                   Despite that danger, a courageous band of young women  most in their 20s, some in college, some married with children  banded together in Chicago to create an underground abortion network. The group was officially created in 1969 as the Abortion Counseling Service of Womens Liberation.                    But after running ads in an underground newspaper: Pregnant? Dont want to be? Call Jane, each member of the group answered the phone as Jane.                    We were co-conspirators with the women who called us, said 75-year-old Laura Kaplan, who published a book about the service in 1997 entitled The Story of Jane: The Legendary Underground Feminist Abortion Service.                Well protect you; we hope youll protect us, Kaplan said.  Well take care of you; we hope youll take care of us.                   What started as referrals to legitimate abortion providers changed to personalized service when some members of Jane learned to safely do the abortions themselves. Between the late 1960s and 1973, the year that the Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade, Jane had arranged or performed over 11,000 abortions.                    Our culture is always searching for heroes, said Kaplan. But you dont have to be a hero to do extraordinary things. Jane was just ordinary people working together  and look what we could accomplish, which is amazing, right?                   Even after several members were caught and arrested, the group continued to provide abortions for women too poor to travel to states where abortion had been legalized.                    I prayed a lot. I didnt want to go to jail, said 80-year-old Marie Learner, who allowed the Janes to perform abortions at her apartment.                   Some of us had little children. Some were the sole breadwinners in their home, Learner said. It was fearlessness in the face of overwhelming odds.                   The story of Jane has been immortalized in Kaplans book, numerous print articles, a 2022 movie, Call Jane, starring Elizabeth Banks and Sigourney Weaver, and a documentary on HBO (which, like CNN, is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery).                    Today the historical tale of Jane has taken on a new significance. After the 2022 Supreme Court reversal of Roe v. Wade and the mid-term takeover of the US House of Representatives by Republicans, emboldened conservative lawmakers and judges have acted on their anti-abortion beliefs.                    Currently more than a dozen states have banned or imposed severe restrictions on abortion.  Georgia has banned abortions after six weeks, even though women are typically unaware they are pregnant at that stage. In mid-April, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed a bill that would ban most abortions after six weeks. It wont go into effect until the state Supreme Court overturns its previous precedent on abortion. Several other states are considering similar legislation. In other states, judicial battles are underway to protect abortion access.                     Its a horrific situation right now. People will be harmed, some may even die, said Booth, who helped birth the Jane movement while in college.                   Women without family support, without the information they need, may be isolated and either harm themselves looking to end an unwanted pregnancy or will be harmed because they went to an unscrupulous and illegal provider, said Booth, now 77.                    A key difference between the 60s and today is medication abortion, which 54% of people in the United States used to end a pregnancy in 2022. Available via prescription and through the mail, use of the drugs is two-fold: A person takes a first pill, mifepristone, to block the hormone needed for a pregnancy to continue. /A day or two later, the patient takes a second drug, misoprostol, which causes the uterus to contract, creating the cramping and bleeding of labor.                   In early April a Texas judge, US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk  a Trump appointee who has been vocal about his anti-abortion stance  suspended the US Food and Drug Administrations approval of mifepristone despite 23 years of data showing the drug is safe to use, safer even than penicillin or Viagra.               On Friday, the Supreme Court froze the ruling and a subsequent decision by the Fifth US Circuit Court of Appeals at the request of the Justice Department and the drug manufacturer. The action allows access to mifepristone in states where its legal until appeals play out over the months to come.                   However, 15 states currently restrict access to medication abortion, even by mail.                   The actions of anti-abortion activists, who have been accused of judge shopping to get the decisions they want, is an unprecedented attack on democracy meant to undermine the will of the vast majority of Americans who want this pill  mifepristone  to remain legal and available, Heather Booth told CNN.                    This is a further weaponization of the courts to brazenly advance the end goal of banning abortion entirely, she added.                    If women in her day could have had access to medications that could be used safely in their homes, they would not have been forced to risk their lives, said Dorie Barron, thinking back to her own terrifying abortion in a sketchy Chicago motel.                   Im depressed as hell, watching stupid, indifferent men control and destroy womens lives all over again, she said. I really fear getting an abortion could soon be like 1965.                   Chicago college student Heather Booth had just finished a summer working with civil rights activists in Mississippi when she was asked to help with a different kind of injustice.                   A girl in another dorm was considering suicide because she was pregnant. Booth, who excelled at both organization and chutzpah, found a local doctor and negotiated an abortion for the girl. Word spread quickly.                   There were about 100 women a week calling for help, much more than one person could handle, Booth said. I recruited about 12 other people and began training them how to do the counseling.                   Counseling was a key part of the new service. This was a time when people barely spoke about sex, how womens bodies functioned or even how people got pregnant, Booth said. To help each woman understand what was going to happen to them, Booth quizzed the abortion provider about every aspect of the procedure.                   What do you do in advance? Will it be painful? How painful? Can you walk afterwards? Do you need someone to be with you to take you home? The questions continued: What amount of bleeding is expected, and can a woman handle it on their own? If theres a problem is there an urgent number they can call?                   Armed with details few if any physicians provided,  the counselors at Jane could fully inform each caller about the abortion experience. The group even published a flyer describing the procedure, long before the groundbreaking 1970 book Our Bodies, Ourselves began to educate women about their sexuality and health.                   I dont particularly like doctors because I always feel dissatisfied with the experience, said Marie Learner, who spoke to many of the women who underwent an abortion at her home.                   But after their abortion at Jane, women told me, Wow, that was the best experience Ive ever had with people helping me with a medical issue.                   Eileen Smith, now 73, was one of those women. Jane made you feel like you were part of this bigger picture, like we were all in this together, she said. They helped me do this illegal thing and then theyre calling to make sure Im OK? Wow!                   For me, it helped battle the feeling that I was a bad person, that Whats wrong with me? Why did I get pregnant? I should know better voice in my head, said Smith. It was priceless.                   Many of the women who joined Jane had never experienced an abortion. Some viewed the work as political, a part of the burgeoning feminist movement. Others considered the service as simply humanitarian health care. All saw the work as an opportunity to respect each womans choice.                   I was a stay-at-home mom with four kids, said Martha Scott, who is now in her 80s. We knew the woman needed to feel as though she was in control of what was happening to her. We were making it happen for her, but it was not about us. It was about her.                   Some volunteers, like Dorie Barron, experienced the Jane difference firsthand when she found herself pregnant a few years after her abortion at the hands of the Mafia.                   It was a 100% total reversal  I had never experienced such kindness, Barron said. Not only did a Jane hold each womans hand and explain every step of the process, they gave each of us a giant supply of maternity sanitary pads, and a nice big handful of antibiotics, she said. And for the next week, I got a phone call every other day to see how I was.                   Barron soon began volunteering for Jane by providing pregnancy testing for women in the back of a church in Chicagos Hyde Park.                   It wasnt just abortion, Barron explained. We also said, You could consider adoption, and gave adoption referrals. And if the woman wanted to continue with her pregnancy, we said, Fine, please by all that is holy make sure you get prenatal care, take your vitamins, and eat as best you can. It was women helping women with whatever they needed.                   Most of the women who contacted Jane were unable to support themselves, in unhealthy relationships, or already had children at home, so the service was a way of helping them get back on track, said Smith, who, like Barron, had begun working for Jane after her abortion.                   We were telling them This isnt the end of the world. You can continue to leave your boyfriend or your husband or continue to just take care of those kids you have. We were there to help them get through this, said Smith, who later became a homecare nurse.                   Diane Stevens says she came to work for Jane after experiencing an abortion in 1968 at the age of 19. She was living in California at the time, which provided ??therapeutic abortions?? if approved in advance by physicians.                    ??I??d had a birth control failure, and I was coached by Planned Parenthood on how to do this,?? said Stevens, now 74. ??I had to see two psychiatrists and one doctor and tell them I was not able to go through with the pregnancy because it would a danger to both my physical and mental health.                   ??I was admitted to the psychiatric ward, although I didn??t really know that ??

CNNNews_64,"             District Judge Jessica Mangrum ruled the law is ambiguous enough to make it difficult for women to obtain abortions, even when facing serious medical complications.                    The law has created an imminent risk that Physician Plaintiffs and other physicians throughout Texas will have no choice but to bar or delay the provision of abortion care to pregnant persons in Texas for whom an abortion would prevent or alleviate a risk of death or risk to their health (including their fertility) for fear of liability under Texass abortion bans, the ruling reads.         Nearly two years after Texas' six-week abortion ban, more infants are dying                The order comes after the judge heard several days of testimony last month from women who say Texas law forced them to continue with high-risk pregnancies.                    One plaintiff, Samantha Casiano, said she was forced to give birth to her daughter despite a diagnosis of anencephaly, a rare birth defect where parts of a babys skull and brain are missing. Casianos child died four hours after birth.                   All she could do was fight to try to get air, Casiano testified in court. I had to watch my daughter go from being pink to red to purple.??                   Lawyers for the state argued in court there was already an adequate exception in the statute for life-threatening pregnancies and blamed doctors for misinterpreting the law.

CNNNews_65,"             Traveling out of state was the only abortion option for Victoria, who asked CNN to withhold her last name out of fear of backlash against her and her family. Louisiana is one of several states that have essentially banned all abortions.                   It was probably one of the hardest things Ive had to go through, from the moment of discovering that I was pregnant at age 45 to actually having to have to take time off work, travel across the country, do a meeting with a doctor, and then take the pills and then skedaddle back home and then go to work like nothing had happened, Victoria told CNN of her experience earlier this year.                    Victorias story about the distance she traveled and the hardships she endured to get an abortion reflects a wider American reality, where women seeking the procedure must navigate through a patchwork of states with varying levels of access.                    The average travel time to an abortion facility more than tripled, from less than 30 minutes to more than an hour and a half, after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, according to a November study in the Journal of the American Medical Association. And for women in Texas and Louisiana, average travel times to the nearest abortion facility were seven hours longer  almost a full workday in travel time to get an abortion.                    Victoria says she was grateful she could drop everything and afford to spend $1,000 for the procedure, including same-week airfare with connections both ways and appointment and medication fees.                   It was so hard for me wrap my head around the fact that I was able to do this, but Im one of the lucky ones and that there are so many women who are in much tighter positions, Victoria said. And, God, what are they going to do?                   Victoria says plans materialized quickly once she knew which states seemed more accessible.                   She researched the parameters for abortion in a state, how long she would have to take off work, travel options and how soon she could get an appointment. She found abortionfinder.org to be a helpful and reliable source, she says.                   Because the situation is so fluid, it changes from day to day, that was really of paramount importance for me to be able to have a reliable source of information, she said.                   Driving to a neighboring state was not an option, as every state adjoining Louisiana has a similarly restrictive law that bans virtually all abortions. Victoria says she considered close states, like Florida, but she ultimately dismissed them because available appointments were farther out.                   Once I saw that Oregon was so, so protective of reproductive rights, I said, Why would I think about going anywhere else? she said. The second I got the definitive pregnancy result, I was like, OK, lets book a flight to Oregon. When can we do this?                   She reached out to a friend from college and asked if she could stay with her, detailing the reason for her visit. She then made an appointment and booked a flight for that week, she says.                   The provider sent instructions, including that the patient must be in Oregon for the telehealth appointment, according to documents provided to CNN. They contacted her within an hour of making the appointment to make sure she had proof of travel documents because she had made it from Louisiana, where the procedure is illegal.                    Victoria planned to take a day off to fly across the country and work remotely for two days, which fits her hybrid work situation. She says she was grateful to have a supportive, female boss who showed understanding for why she had to take the unexpected time off.                    She was the only person I actually kind of broke down and cried for, Victoria said. I think its because I had been holding it back all week, and telling her was sort of the last thing that I needed to get in place before I could do everything.                   Victoria says the hardest part of her experience was telling her mother because she didnt know how her mom would feel about it. Victoria and her siblings were raised Catholic. Her father had a strong faith and her mother was a non-practicing Catholic, her mother says. Victorias mom asked not to be named for privacy reasons.                   Victorias mother says she wanted to support her daughter, even if she does not agree with what her daughter did. Victoria coming to her with tickets purchased and a full plan made it easy for her mother to support her, the mother says.                   I agreed to drive her to the airport and that that was the only thing I could do because this would be a real game-changing thing in her life, her mother said. ??I wanted to support what she wanted to do because she has supported me on several family crises. I just wanted to do it because I love her. ??                   Victoria said she appreciated her mom for being supportive in a way she didn??t expect. They talked about some of her mother??s friends who had abortions throughout the years, both say. Victoria??s mother even told her about when she tried to get her tubes tied, but her husband found out and she did not pursue it.                   ??I feel like, if anything, it??s made our relationship stronger,?? Victoria said. ??We already had a fantastically strong relationship, though. So, it??s another rock in the wall.??                   After boarding early on a Wednesday in March, Victoria traveled for eight hours on two flights and landed in Portland, Oregon.                   Victoria reunited with her friend, and they did the things tha",,3,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CNNNews_66,"             Abortion is really nothing new. The child sacrifice is a very satanic practice, and thats precisely what abortion is. And we need to see it as such, Karamo, a community college professor, said in an October 2020 episode of her podcast Its Solid Food, which CNNs KFile reviewed.                    When people in other cultures, when they engage in child sacrifice, they didnt just sacrifice the child for the sake of bloodshed, Karamo said later in the episode. They sacrificed the child cuz they were hoping to get prosperity and thats precisely why people have abortion now. Because Im not ready. I dont wanna have a baby. I dont feel like it. I dont have time. I wanna make more money. I want my freedom. So youre sacrificing that child hoping to get something out of their death, which is your freedom, your happiness, your prosperity.                    In another comment, Karamo called abortion the the greatest crime of our nations history.                    Karamo and her campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment by CNN.                   Karamo, a devout conservative Christian who has served on the board of Michigans Right to Life organization and on the board of an anti-abortion pregnancy crisis center affiliate in Detroit, reiterated that belief in another episode from July 2020, in which she said humans have sacrificed other humans, including their own children, for thousands of years, just packaged differently.                     [People] were sacrificing them to these deities, which were really demons, she said.                    Karamo went on to say in a later episode of her podcast reviewed by CNNs KFile that demonic possession is real and can be transmitted through intimate relationships.                    If a person has demonic possession  I know its gonna sound really crazy to me saying that for some people, thinking like what?! Karamo said in September 2020. But having intimate relationships with people who are demonically possessed or oppressed  I strongly believe that a person opens themselves up to possession. Demonic possession is real.                     Karamo has repeatedly touted to her followers that left-leaning elites are trying to push their own values, including pro-abortion views, on America. In a video she posted on her website in 2018 that CNN??s KFile accessed and reviewed, Karamo suggested a conspiracy in which left-leaning political operatives who now have business relationships with Netflix ?C including prominent philanthropist and Democratic donor George Soros, former national security adviser Susan Rice and former President Barack Obama ?? were taking over the streaming service to push pro-abortion content.                   ??Is abortion funny to you?

CNNNews_67,"             CNN has told the stories of several women  including one from Houston, one from central Texas and one from Cleveland  and what they had to do to obtain medically necessary abortions.                      Now, a woman from Austin, Texas, has come forward because she nearly died when she couldnt get a timely abortion.                   This is her story.                     Amanda Eid and Josh Zurawski, both now 35, met in 1991 at Aldersgate Academy preschool in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and dated in high school.                      Josh always tells me hes been in love with me since we were 4 years old, Amanda said.                     Three years ago, they married in Austin, Texas, where they both work in high-tech jobs.                    They tried to have a family but failed. Amanda had fertility treatments for a year and a half and finally became pregnant.                     Very excited to share that Baby Zurawski is expected in late January, Amanda shared on Instagram in July. The post included a picture of her and her husband in Mama and Dad hats, Amanda holding a strip of ultrasound photos of their baby girl.                     The fact that we were pregnant at all was a miracle, and we were beside ourselves with happiness, she said.                     But then, 18 weeks  just four months  into her pregnancy, Amandas water broke.                     The amniotic fluid that her baby depended upon was leaking out.  She says her doctor told her the baby would not survive.                     We found out that we were going to lose our baby, Amanda said. My cervix was dilating fully 22 weeks prematurely, and I was inevitably going to miscarry.                     She and Josh begged the doctor to see if there was any way to save the baby.                     I just kept asking, isnt there anything we can do? And the answer was no,  Amanda said.                     When a womans water breaks, shes at high risk for a life-threatening infection. While Amanda and Joshs baby  they named her Willow  was sure to die, she still had a heartbeat, and so doctors said that under Texas law, they were unable to terminate the pregnancy.          'Heartbreaking' stories go untold, doctors say, as employers 'muzzle' them in wake of abortion ruling               My doctor said, Well, right now we just have to wait, because we cant induce labor, even though youre 100% for sure going to lose your baby,  Amanda said. [The doctors] were unable to do their own jobs because of the way that the laws are written in Texas.                     Texas law allows for abortion if the mother has a life-threatening physical condition aggravated, caused by, or arising from a pregnancy that places the female at risk of death or poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function.                    But Texas lawmakers havent spelled out exactly what that means, and a doctor found to be in violation of the law can face loss of their medical license and a possible life sentence in prison.                     Theyre extremely vague, said Katie Keith, director of the Health Policy and Law Initiative at Georgetown University Law Center. They dont spell out exactly the situations when an abortion can be provided.                     In September, CNN reached out to 28 Texas legislators who sponsored anti-abortion legislation, asking them for their response to CNN stories about the woman in Houston and the woman in central Texas.                    Only one legislator responded.                     Like any other law, there are unintended consequences. We do not want to see any unintended consequences; if we do, it is our responsibility as legislators to fix those flaws, wrote state Sen. Eddie Lucio, who will be leaving the Senate at the end of the year.                     The Zurawskis participated in an ad for Beto ORourkes unsuccessful Texas gubernatorial campaign.                     After her water broke, Amandas doctors sent her home and told her to watch for signs of infection, and that only when she was considered sick enough that my life was at risk would they terminate the pregnancy, Amanda said.                     My doctor said it could take hours, it could take days, it could take weeks, she remembers.                      Once they heard hours, they decided there was no time to travel to another state for an abortion.

CNNNews_68,"             Anti-abortion advocates gathered in Washington, DC, on Friday for the annual March for Life  the second since the Supreme Court overturned federal abortion protections.                   Attendees who convened on the National Mall on a cold, snowy day said with Roe v. Wade overturned, theyre now looking to states to pass abortion bans. At least 14 Republican-majority states have banned the procedure with little to no exceptions, and seven others have limited access.                   Whats next is the state level, said Blake Miller, member of a pro-life group at North Carolina State University. We want to take it to the states, have pro-life marches at the states and hopefully get our state legislators to get a ban on abortion up to conception.                   Fridays national march  the theme of which was Pro-life: With Every Woman, For Every Child  precedes marches scheduled in the coming weeks in more than a dozen states, including in Arizona, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky and North Dakota, where abortion bans are already in effect.                   Jim Hogan, who traveled to Washington from Pennsylvania for the march, stressed that we have to continue to march and to help persuade people.                   Fifty years of making it okay to abort, I dont expect in a year everyones mind to change, said Hogan.                   This years march followed the new route set by the 2023 march, ending at the US Capitol instead of the Supreme Court to symbolize that the battle post-Roe has shifted to the legislature, one of the organizers then told CNN.

CNNNews_69,"             The?Alabama Supreme Courts?ruling on?Friday?will transform infertility care across the state, potentially setting the stage for a ruling that?a fetus or even an embryo?outside the womb?holds constitutional?rights.                   The ruling is a reminder of how important?fetal personhood?is becoming for both the antiabortion movement and the Republican Party  and of its potentially drastic consequences. In the United States today, recognizing the value of an embryo or fetus sets a precedent that no state can permit access to abortion  and that anyone who chooses abortion may be committing a crime.                   The irony in the Alabama courts decision is that more Americans who want to be parents will be unable to achieve that dream.?The ruling is extraordinary not only in declaring personhood before birth but also in applying the idea to embryos that havent been implanted in the uterus. But the ruling is not just bizarre; its consequences may be profound.                   If an embryo is a person, it can no longer be destroyed, donated for research or?potentially?even stored. Some abortion opponents argue that if embryos are persons, each one that is created must be implanted  and that would make even storing embryos for future use impermissible. If any of that comes to pass  and in Alabama, it likely will  that will transform how in vitro fertilization (IVF) works, and will mean a lower rate of success for Americans who already struggle to start a family.                   The courts ruling could?set a precedent for other conservative states that embrace the idea of?personhood?before birth,?making it harder to pursue IVF across large swaths of the country. The decision will also bolster a broader antiabortion effort to recognize a fetus in the womb or?even a frozen embryo?as a person under?federal?constitutional law, helping abortion opponents make the case that if states already sometimes treat?an embryo or fetus?as a rights-holder, constitutional law should do the same.       Related article Doctor: Why Im cheering about pharmacists in my state prescribing birth control pills               The Alabama case began when three couples visited a fertility clinic in Mobile to pursue IVF: a treatment in which multiple eggs are harvested, fertilized and implanted to create a pregnancy. Across the US annually, about?2% of births?involve IVF. The success rate of each IVF cycle can be low given the age and previous medical?condition of the patient.                   Since many patients who turn to fertility clinics experience trouble getting pregnant, physicians routinely create and store excess embryos so that patients can try again if a first attempt fails. IVF is also expensive  an average cycle can cost anywhere between $12,000 and $30,000, even when patients can use?embryos theyve already created. This means that patients have more embryos than they implant in a given cycle, which they can choose to store, give to other patients or donate for research.                   The three Alabama couples elected to store their excess embryos at the Mobile clinic from 2013 to 2016. In December 2020, however, a patient from an attached hospital entered the clinic, handled some of the embryos and?injured?their hand, given the subzero temperatures at which the embryos are stored. As a result, they dropped the embryos and accidentally?destroyed them.                   The plaintiffs sued, first alleging that the clinic was negligent in how it monitored the embryos, contending that the clinic breached the contract it?signed with the couples. The couples also had a much more controversial claim: that their embryos counted as children or persons under the states wrongful death of?a minor law.       Related article Opinion: French women got a wakeup call on abortion rights from their US sisters               The Alabama Supreme Court agreed that the?embryos were persons. The court pointed to a 2018 ballot measure that recognized fetuses?as persons under state law. The People of this State, the court explained, have adopted a Constitutional amendment directly aimed at stopping courts from excluding unborn life?from legal protection.?It did not matter to the court that the embryos were frozen and not yet implanted in the uterus.

CNNNews_70,"             Across the US, mainstream institutions such as the American Civil Liberties Union, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and CNN are increasingly opting for gender-neutral terms such as pregnant people, people who get abortions and birthing parent in favor of women when referencing pregnancy, fertility and abortion.                   These shifts in terminology signal an effort to be inclusive of transgender and nonbinary people who can also get pregnant. But the changes have also prompted pushback  not just from Republican politicians who are openly hostile to LGBTQ people but also from some cisgender women (women whose gender identity conforms with the sex they were assigned at birth) who consider themselves LGBTQ allies and who support abortion rights.                   Were not just talking about the same people that we were before. Were broadening the scope, said Kristen Syrett, an associate professor of linguistics at Rutgers University. And I think thats where people get more uncomfortable because its so different from the way weve been thinking of reproductive rights and pregnancy for a long time.                   Debates about language can seem arbitrary at a time when so many no longer have access to abortion services in their home state. But at the crux of these debates are questions about who is targeted by restrictive laws and policies, who is affected and who is included in the conversation.                   Using inclusive language to talk about abortion recognizes that not only cis women can get pregnant, said Gillian Branstetter, a communications strategist at the ACLUs Womens Rights Project and LGBTQ & HIV Project.                   Some trans men and nonbinary people can also get pregnant, as can cis girls and trans boys. This is also true in the opposite: Not all women are able to get pregnant. Some cis women struggle with fertility, while trans women lack uteruses. Opting for gender-neutral terms such as people or patients allows for these nuances in a way that just saying women does not.         'We're a part of this movement, too.' Transgender and nonbinary people say they feel excluded from the abortion fight                 Theres scant data on how many trans and nonbinary people get pregnant and receive abortions given that medical systems in the US track them as female. A 2019 study from Rutgers University suggests that up to 30% of trans men experience unplanned pregnancies, and a 2020 study from researchers at the Guttmacher Institute and Planned Parenthood estimated between 462 and 530 trans and nonbinary people received abortions in 2017 (the CDC reports that approximately 609,000 total abortions were performed that year). As more adults identify as trans or nonbinary, experts say that such estimates are likely undercounted.                   Still, those numbers pale in comparison to the numbers of cis women who access reproductive health care  a point often made by critics of more inclusive terms. Branstetter acknowledged this reality, noting that 99% of people who are going to become pregnant or are in need of birth control or an abortion are women.                   But its necessary to make room for trans and nonbinary people precisely because of the significant barriers they face in receiving reproductive care, she added. Its important to remember that transgender people do not have the privilege of pretending we do not exist.                   Others are concerned that forgoing the term women obscures what they see as the driving force behind attacks on abortion rights: Misogyny.                   Carrie Baker, professor of the study of women and gender at Smith College, considers gender-neutral terms such as pregnant people to be inaccurate and imprecise. In theory, she said, people also includes cisgender men, whose bodies are not affected by abortion restrictions.                   Baker said she recognizes the importance of being inclusive, and tries to reference in her writing when possible the various groups who are affected by abortion restrictions. But because she sees cisgender women as the primary targets of abortion bans, she said she makes it a point to emphasize women.                   Not doing so, Baker said, erases the sexism underlying laws that seek to exert control over womens bodies.                   Pregnant people doesnt say who were talking about. It makes (pregnancy) sound like its a gender-neutral phenomenon or a sex-neutral phenomenon, she added. I believe that bans on abortion are motivated by sex discrimination and by bias against women and cisgender women, or just femininity.                   As some abortion rights supporters now look to the Equal Rights Amendment to establish a constitutional right to abortion, Baker said being explicit about the role of sexism in abortion restrictions is necessary to challenge such laws. Doing that effectively, in her view, means naming women.                   I think we need to talk about that or we, in essence, do what the right does, which is trying to erase the significance of the discriminatory impact of abortion bans, Baker said.                   Some have gone as far as to suggest that women as a class are being erased. Earlier this year, The New York Times opinion columnist Pamela Paul decried the use of terms such as ??pregnant people?? in a piece, writing that ??This isn??t just a semantic issue; it??s also a question of moral harm, an affront to our very sense of ourselves.?? The Atlantic??s Helen Lewis accused the left of ??declaring a war on saying ??women.????                    ??By substituting people for women, we lose the ability to speak of women as a class. We dismantle them into pieces, into functions, into commodities,?? she argued.

CNNNews_71,"             When the Supreme Court last summer reversed Roe v. Wade and eliminated constitutional protections that guaranteed abortion rights nationwide, the conservative majority fashioned its ruling as returning the matter of abortion policy-making to elected officials, particularly in state legislatures.         Post-Roe, abortion access has dropped in the US, but support has not, survey finds               But the battle lines now being drawn around the Reconstruction-era federal law  the Comstock Act  are an example of how the picture after Roe v. Wade is far more complicated as abortion opponents are challenging the means of abortion, such as the drug mifepristone, in court.                   The most sweeping Comstock Act arguments from anti-abortion activists could at the very least end the availability of medication abortion, which make up the majority of abortions in the US today, and could have the effect of eliminating surgical abortions as well by restricting the shipment of medical instruments and supplies used in the procedure.                   Comstock is really the backdoor way to remove access to abortion across the whole country, said Greer Donley, a University of Pittsburgh Law School professor who specializes in abortion law.                   A fight over the reach of the law and how it can be deployed is beginning to brew in court. It has also been on the radar of state and local officials. But the end goal is a GOP-led federal government willing and empowered to wield the law in a way that could make it impossible for abortion providers to operate.                   If the current proxy legal battles over the statutes meaning unfold in the way abortion opponents hope, enforcement of the law could be a central issue in the 2024 White House race and congressional campaigns, given federal lawmakers power to repeal it.                   The Comstock Act, first passed in 1873, is named after Anthony Comstock, who was a special agent of the US Postal Service and an anti-vice crusader.                    The laws critics say its discriminatory against women, pointing out that at the time of its adoption, women could not vote and the Supreme Court had not yet interpreted the Constitutional Equal Protection Clause to prohibit sex discrimination.                    The statute bans the mailing of articles or things designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion, or for any indecent or immoral use, and in a separate section, describes its prohibition as being on any drug, medicine, article, or thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion.                    Prosecutions under the law were bought in the first few decades after its passage, but by the 1930s, courts began whittling down some of its provisions and enforcement of the law ceased. Congress meanwhile amended it in the 1970s to remove its ban on mailing birth control.                    Anti-abortion activists contend, however, that the part of the statute having to do with abortion-inducing drug remains good law, even if there was no appetite for enforcing it while the Supreme Courts 1973 Roe v. Wade precedent  which protected abortion rights nationwide  was on the books. That precedent was overturned by the high courts conservative majority last June.         Senate Democrat unveils bill aimed to end tactic of judge-shopping to block federal policies               Now that Roe is gone, the law springs back into life, said Roger Severino, the vice president of domestic policy at the conservative think tank, the Heritage Foundation, who also served as a top civil rights lawyer in the Department of Health and Human Services under the Trump administration.                    Severino argued that, at least when it comes to the Comstock Acts prohibitions on mailing abortion pills, Congress is well within its powers to regulate those shipments.                   While prominent anti-abortion lawyers are focused on how the law applies to the mailing of abortion drugs, the maximalist interpretations being put forward by some abortion foes would mean that tools and medical instruments that facilitate surgical abortions that are shipped in the mail to clinics and other facilities would be caught in the Comstock Acts net.                    If Comstock comes to life, it has power to ban abortion nationwide. & Its not just pills, Donley said. Any abortion provider in the country is going to use the mail to get the things that they need for the provision of abortion.                    Already, the Comstock Act has played a cameo role in the ongoing, high-stakes lawsuit over the US Food and Drugs Administration regulation of abortion pills, which made it up to the Supreme Court once and is likely to land with the justices again.                    The Supreme Court froze lower court orders that would have curtailed access to a medication abortion drug, but litigation over its use will continue, raising the possibility that the Comstock Act could play a more central role in that case. Depending on how the legal battle plays out, it could empower the Justice Department in a possible future Republican administration to bring prosecutions under the law, which could complicate  or perhaps even end  access to abortion.                    In the meantime, the anti-abortion movement appears to be looking for ways to tee up disputes over whether the law is enforceable and how far it reaches.                    The Supreme Court is going to have to address this issue, sooner rather than later, said Mark Lee Dickson, an anti-abortion activist who has been involved in local efforts to seize upon the US law. He sees the Comstock Act as a de facto federal abortion ban.                   Both sides of the abortion debate acknowledge that the clearest test of what the Comstock Act means likely wouldnt emerge until a Republican takes the White House and puts in place Justice Department leadership that would be willing to enforce the law.                    The Biden administration has adopted a legal posture that takes a narrow view of the laws applicability, arguing that it does not prohibit the mailing of abortion drugs if theyre not intended for an unlawful use.                    If the Supreme Court endorses the broad interpretation of the law put forward by anti-abortion activists, it would raise the stakes significantly for the 2024 election, said Mary Ziegler, a UC-Davis School of Law professor and author of Abortion and the Law in America: Roe v. Wade to the Present.                    You would have essentially on the ballot the question of both Comstock enforcement and also potentially Comstock repeal, Ziegler said.                    Do I think, under a Trump presidency, theyre going to confiscate surgical gloves because they could be adapted for use in abortion? No, I dont think thats probably going to happen, Ziegler added. But the language is so broad that it really would be the license to go after a lot of things beyond just abortion pills.                   The Biden administration, in an internal advisory opinion released by the Justice Departments Office of Legal Counsel, argues that the law does not apply to the mailing of abortion pills if theyre not being sent with the intent of unlawful use. The opinion pointed to how 20th century courts had interpreted it narrowly as excluding drugs mailed with legitimate intent.                    (OLC opinions dictate how executive branch agencies approach legal questions but do not have any binding effect in the court of law.)         The Supreme Court that overturned Roe v. Wade now takes it slow on abortion                The opinion was rolled out just before the FDA unveiled new rules around abortion pills that allow pharmacies to dispense the drug.                    The Comstock Act has been invoked in the challenge to the FDAs 2000 approval of the medication abortion drug mifepristone, where the plaintiffs  anti-abortion doctors and medical organizations  are arguing that the FDA broke the law by failing to take its criminal prohibitions into account when approving the drug.                     There are also questions about whether the law applies not just to medication abortion, but to the tools used for surgical abortions as well. A lawyer representing the anti-abortion doctors in the current FDA case told CNN theyre not focused on that question while their assertions about mailing abortion pills play out in court.                    The challenge to the FDAs 2000 approval of the drug used for medication abortion is not the only case where courts are being asked to expound upon the Comstock Acts reach.                    Several towns, some in New Mexico and elsewhere, have passed local ordinances that cite the Comstock Act and prohibit business within those jurisdictions from shipping or receiving items used for abortions in the mail,",,1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CNNNews_72,"             There were about 5,000 fewer legal abortions each month, on average, than there were in the months before the ruling  a drop of about 6%.        Clinics and doctors brace for more restrictions on women's health care after court ruling on abortion drug               In April and May, there were an average of about 82,000 abortions each month, according to the analysis. From July through December, that fell to an average of 77,000 abortions per month. The total number of abortions fluctuated month-to-month, but was always lower than it was in April.                    The Society of Family Planning, a nonprofit focused on abortion and contraception, sponsored a research effort that collected data from abortion providers nationwide  including clinics, private medical offices, hospitals and virtual clinics. More than 80% of known providers responded. Self-managed abortions that occur outside of the formal health care system were not included in the analysis.        Suspension of mifepristone approval wouldn't be the end of medication abortion               In the 13 states that enacted bans following the Supreme Court decision, abortions fell more than 95%, with just a few reported each month from July to December. But in the remaining set of states, the average number of abortions ticked up slightly. There were surges in some of those states, including Minnesota and Kansas, that suggest that individuals living in states with more restrictions may travel for care.                    ??Those unable to overcome travel barriers",,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CNNNews_73,"             The second time, Martin was a 26-year-old single mom making $12 an hour as a bank teller, could barely afford childcare or health insurance and was in a custody battle with her daughters father. Martin would later have four more abortions, each time knowing she did not want another child.                    Now Martin, who is Black, worries that other women, particularly women of color, wont have that choice if the Supreme Court affirms a leaked decision to overturn Roe v. Wade  the landmark ruling that legalized abortion in 1973.                    Im stressed, Im concerned, Im worried, said Martin, 46 of Richmond, Virginia. Kids dont deserve to be brought into a life of poverty.                    The threat to abortion access has underscored the economic hardships and maternal health crisis that Black and brown women face, with many advocates saying forced pregnancies would only worsen their outcomes. Black women are three times more likely than White women to die of pregnancy-related complications; encounter racism from health care providers at higher rates; face unequal pay; and are more likely than their White counterparts to lack health insurance. Abortion rights advocates say the pay disparity alone hampers Black womens ability to secure affordable childcare and housing. And there are no federal laws that mandate paid maternity leave. Activists also argue that there has been little movement on federal police reform that they say would create safer environments for Black women to raise their children.                   Abortion access has also gained the attention of lawmakers including Rep. Ayanna Pressley who made an impassioned plea for the Senate to pass the Womens Health Protection Act, a Democrat-led bill aimed at preserving access to abortion nationwide.                    Pressley said banning abortion is forced birth in a country that deprives families of universal health care, child care and paid medical and family leave.                   The anti-abortion movement in America is rooted in organized White supremacy, and overturning Roe v. Wade would only perpetuate cycles of poverty and trap our most vulnerable in systems of oppression, Pressley said on the House floor last week. None of this is abstract. There is a history of medical apartheid in this country against Black, brown, immigrant, indigenous and disabled folks.                   Still, the Womens Health Protection Act failed in the Senate last week, which was expected amid GOP resistance.                    President Joe Biden lashed out at Senate Republicans after the failed Senate vote.                    This failure to act comes at a time when womens constitutional rights are under unprecedented attack  and it runs counter to the will of the majority of American people, Biden said in a statement.                    Some activists say banning abortion will only exacerbate the economic struggles of Black and brown women.                    Monica Simpson, executive director of Sistersong, said she considers it racist that lawmakers want to ban abortion but not fix the systems that have oppressed and marginalized Black families.                    Simpson said many Black women are underpaid and living in communities without access to fresh food or health care facilities. U.S. Census data shows Black women are paid 63% of what White men make on average. And about 24% of the Black community faced food insecurity in 2020.                    Black Americans are also more likely than White Americans to suffer multigenerational poverty, according to a Brookings report. The report found that one in five Black Americans is living in poverty for the third generation in a row compared to one in 100 White Americans.                    Now some Black women who want abortions may be forced to have unwanted babies because they cant afford to travel to a state where its legal to get the procedure, Simpson said.                    We dont have to have statistics to know that when you remove access or limit access to any service in this country its going to disproportionately impact people of color, poor people, Simpson said. Its going to impact the folks that have been historically pushed to the margins.        Texas' abortion law is one of the most restrictive in the developed world               Cathy Torres, organizing manager for the McAllen, Texas-based Frontera Fund which provides financial support for women seeking abortion care, said the six-week abortion ban in Texas has already made it hard for women to access abortion.                    If the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, it will be even harder because Texas and other neighboring states have trigger laws that outlaw abortion in all or most cases if Roe is dropped, she said.                    Torres said she expects a significant uptick in calls given many of her clients are low income, Latina women who will need the money to travel farther to get an abortion.                   According to the Pew Research Center, 21% of Latinos age 18-64 in Texas are living in poverty and 31% of Latinos don??t have health insurance.                    ??If you are low income, how are you expected to fly to Virginia to get an abortion??? Torres said. ??How are you expected to pay for an abortion???                   Some activists and Democratic lawmakers point to abortion bans as a form of White supremacy, which is a term to used to describe White people having dominance over people of other races and ethnicities.                    An overwhelming number of White, male lawmakers have been at the forefront of the fight to ban abortion at the federal and state level.                   In many states, Black and Latino women receive abortions at higher rates than White women, according to the Centers for Disease Control ?C which collects data from state health agencies.

CNNNews_74,"             Would Jenny Slates Donna, a fledgling stand-up comedian with a penchant for potty humor, end up with Jake Lacys buttoned-up Max? And would Robespierre find investors whod trust her to make the movie she wanted as a first-time filmmaker?                    Over the several years it took to get Obvious Child to theaters, though, one pivotal point was never in doubt: The films protagonist was going to have an abortion, free of shame and regret.                    Obvious Child was one of the first films  and a comedy, at that  to depict an abortion in a way that wasnt traumatic or life-upending. Slates protagonist gets pregnant, decides to have an abortion and emerges a stronger comedian, fart jokes intact. The procedure doesnt destroy her life, and it isnt meaningless either. It just is.         A  movie about romance and ... abortion?               The challenge wasnt to make a funny movie about abortion, but it was to make a movie that was romantic and funny and dealt with an unplanned pregnancy with an abortion without shame, Robespierre told CNN.                    Since Obvious Child premiered in 2014, abortion storylines have grown more numerous and nuanced, reflective of the breadth of patients experiences. The decision to have an abortion sets the plot in motion in celebrated films like Eliza Hittmans Never Rarely Sometimes Always. Characters choose to end pregnancies in pivotal episodes of streaming series like Sex Education, Bojack Horseman and Dear White People and network TV staples like Station 19 and Jane the Virgin.                All of those series and films depict abortion differently. They vary in tone; characters motivations are unique. There is no one right way to tell an abortion story. But seeing them onscreen can humanize the issue thats become wildly divisive, said Steph Herold, a research analyst at Abortion Onscreen, a project at the University of California San Francisco that tracks and studies abortion storylines in media.                   Seeing characters have abortions on television [or in film] may be the first time someone sees abortion as a personal issue, not just a political issue, Herold said.                   As the future of Roe v. Wade dominates the news, Robespierre and Hittman have seen renewed interest in their films. They spoke with CNN about how they crafted the abortion plotlines in their films with care and respect  and what their films mean to viewers now.                   When Obvious Child was released eight years ago, it felt quietly revolutionary to depict a single woman in her late 20s deciding, without trepidation, to end a pregnancy. But its not that unique, Robespierre noted. About 18% of pregnancies in the US end in induced abortion, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in 2021. In 2019, the CDC recorded nearly 630,000 abortions.                   What became a relatable, groundbreaking rom-com started out as a personal story, Robespierre said.                   The blueprint was my life, she told CNN.                    Like Obvious Childs Donna, Robespierre had an abortion around Valentines Day. Her mother, like Donnas parent, also told Robespierre about an abortion shed had in the 1960s, before the Roe v. Wade decision made abortion legal nationwide. Both of their stories shaped what would become Robespierres feature debut.                    The women in Robespierres family made her feel comfortable to discuss abortion and supported her when she decided to have one. Its why she made the film, she said  to continue the history of what an abortion could look like with that support and love.                   Even with support, though, abortion isnt always easy to access, and Obvious Child spotlights those barriers, too. In one scene, Donna is discussing the procedure in a Planned Parenthood office in New York. After cracking a disarming joke to settle her nerves, she finally breaks down when she learns the procedure will cost her $500.                    Thats, like, my whole rent, almost, Donna tells a physician through tears.                   She held it together, and shes being strong and stoic, but then the price of the abortion is what kind of put her over the edge, and thats the take we used, Robespierre said. It just felt really authentic.                    Like Obvious Child, much of Eliza Hittmans heartbreakingly realistic film, Never Rarely Sometimes Always, takes place at Planned Parenthood offices in New York. But the protagonist of the 2020 film is almost entirely on her own.                   The award-winning Sundance stunner follows Autumn, played by first-time actor Sidney Flanagan, a small-town Pennsylvania teen who learns shes pregnant and heads to Manhattan on a days-long odyssey to access an abortion.                    I knew I wanted it to be about somebody traveling from out of state into New York City and all of the obstacles they encounter while trying to access safe reproductive care, Hittman said.         Some abortion clinics are preparing for more out-of-state patients if Roe v. Wade is overturned               Ever-committed to realism, Hittman said she spent years researching the processes her protagonist would eventually go through on camera. Hittman visited abortion clinics in New York as well as pregnancy care centers, which are often affiliated with anti-abortion groups, both of which make appearances in the film. Hittman took pregnancy tests and sat for counseling sessions with a social worker she ended up casting in the film, then filtered what she learned through the perspective of Autumn.                   The emotional centerpiece of the film comes before Autumn??s procedure, which Hittman doesn??t show in the film. In a particularly wrenching scene, during which a Planned Parenthood staffer is interviewing Autumn about her relationship history, we learn that our lead has been in unhealthy, even abusive relationships before she??s turned 18.         These are the states where abortion rights will still be protected if Roe v. Wade is overturned               Kelly Chapman, the real-life social worker who plays a Planned Parenthood counselor in the film, told Hittman that the ??crisis is never ",,6,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wade, corporate giants from a range of industries pledged to provide support and financial assistance for employees  and, in some cases, their dependents  seeking abortions in states that outlaw the procedure.                    The courts decision to roll back the nearly 50-year-old landmark ruling, which protected the federal, constitutional right to an abortion, is expected to transform the landscape of reproductive health in America, leaving abortion policy up to individual states and paving the way for numerous states to pass new abortion restrictions. As of Friday afternoon, state officials in at least seven states said that new abortion bans can now be enforced.                    Millions of people seeking abortions could soon be forced to travel across state lines to access the procedure, adding to the cost of an already often expensive healthcare service. For many, employers benefit packages may be the only way they can afford an abortion.        Search histories, location data, text messages: How personal data could be used to enforce anti-abortion laws               In response, corporations, some with headquarters or offices in Republican-controlled states, are taking action. Companies such as Citigroup                              (C), Salesforce                              (CRM) and Match Group                              (MTCH) first promised financial support to employees seeking abortions in affected states after a draft version of the opinion leaked in May. Many more followed suit on Friday. Some, including Bumble and Lyft, also previously said they would donate to organizations that support womens rights, such as Planned Parenthood and Fund Texas Choice.                    Corporate America is increasingly being drawn from the political sidelines on the abortion issue in response to pressure from investors, customers and employees. Companies are also struggling to attract and retain talent, and worry about the impact these states anti-abortion laws could have on their workers.                   Here are some of the prominent companies offering expanded assistance to staff in states curtailing abortion care.                   Microsoft                              (MSFT) extended its financial support for critical healthcare, including abortions and gender-affirming care, to include coverage for travel expenses for such services, after the draft opinion overturning Roe was first leaked.                   The companys existing benefits package allows employees to travel out of state for medical care if it is unavailable in their home state, according to an Apple                              (AAPL) spokesperson.                    The tech giant intends to offer travel expense reimbursement to the extent permitted by law for employees seeking out-of-state health care and reproductive services, according to a spokesperson. We are in the process of assessing how best to do so given the legal complexities involved, the Meta spokesperson said in a statement.                    Yelps existing healthcare plan for US employees pays for women, family members and partners to travel out of states with strict abortion laws, such as Texas and Oklahoma, which ban abortions after 6 weeks.         These are the states where abortion rights are still protected after Roe v. Wade                This ruling puts womens health in jeopardy, denies them their human rights, and threatens to dismantle the progress weve made toward gender equality in the workplaces since Roe, Jeremy Stoppelman, co-founder of Yelp                              (YELP), said in a statement Friday. Business leaders must step up to support the health and safety of their employees by speaking out against the wave of abortion bans that will be triggered as a result of this decision, and call on Congress to codify Roe into law.                   Disney                              (DIS) employees who are unable to access medical care in one location will be given affordable coverage to access the same care in another location, according to a company spokesperson. The benefit covers family planning and pregnancy-related decisions.                   Uber                              (UBER)s US insurance plans already cover reproductive health benefits, including abortion and travel expenses to access healthcare. The rideshare company will also reimburse any drivers sued under state law for providing transportation to a clinic through the app, according to an Uber                              (UBER) spokesperson.                    The streaming company offers travel reimbursement coverage for US full-time employees and their dependents who need to travel for healthcare treatments including abortions and gender-affirming care, a Netflix                              (NFLX) spokesperson told CNN. The company provides a lifetime allowance of $10,000 per employees (or their dependents) per service.                    Bumble                              (BMBL), a female-driven dating app, said Friday that it will support its employees ability to access the healthcare services they need, including abortion care. A Bumble                              (BMBL) spokesperson added that the company will donate to the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas and Planned Parenthood Federation of America.                   Abortion is healthcare, and healthcare is a human right. We are deeply troubled by the Supreme Court decision, the spokesperson said in a statement.                    Dating app company Match Group                              (MTCH) in October established a partnership with Planned Parenthood Los Angeles to provide abortion access for its Texas employees and their dependents. The company is currently considering expanding that benefit to all its US staff, including remote employees in states with trigger laws that may soon ban abortions, according to a Match spokesperson. Match healthcare plans also help to cover travel and lodging costs for employees who need to travel to receive care, the spokesperson said.                    Box.com will cover employee travel and medical expenses incurred by employees while seeking reproductive services.                   The denim company said through The Levi Strauss Foundation that it is providing grants to the Center for Reproductive Rights, Afiya Center and ARC-Southeast which provides direct assistance to women and communities in need of care. The company previously said that under its benefits plan, employees can be reimbursed for travel expenses for services not available in their home state, including abortion. Part-time staff and others who arent included in the companys benefits plan are also eligible for reimbursement, it said.                   Comcast                              (CCZ) has an existing healthcare travel benefit for all employees that covers up to $4,000 per trip, up to three trips per year, with a maximum coverage cap of $10,000 per year. The amount paid out depends on the type of health care procedure, but abortion care is covered, according to the company.                    Warner Brothers Discovery, which owns CNN, on Friday expanded healthcare benefits options to include expenses for employees and their covered family members who need to travel to access abortions and other reproductive care, according to a company spokesperson.                   The media company said Friday it will reimburse travel and lodging for employees who need abortion, infertility or gender-reaffirming services and cannot obtain them locally. CEO Roger Lynch said in an internal memo the Supreme Court decision was a crushing blow to reproductive rights?? and said the most powerful way the company can respond is through its content and journalism.                    JPMorgan                              (JPM) on Friday said that its health care benefits have long covered abortion care. And starting in July, abortion will be included in the company??s health care travel benefit that covers services that can only be obtained far f",,1,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CNNNews_76,"             After the US Supreme Court overturned the right to an abortion last year with the Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization decision, several states quickly passed laws that restricted such procedures. A report released Tuesday and described in the medical journal the Lancet finds that the laws in at least one state left workers at many hospitals confused about how to proceed.        These women ran an underground abortion network in the 1960s. Here's what they fear might happen today               When the court made its decision, the Oklahoma law that criminalized abortion in 1910 went back into effect, according to the states attorney general. Lawmakers then created multiple overlapping laws that further criminalized abortion and increased penalties for those who performed or assisted in an abortion procedure, according to the new report from Physicians for Human Rights, Oklahoma Call for Reproductive Justice and the Center for Reproductive Rights.                    The Oklahoma laws allow abortion in the case of a medical emergency, but one doesnt define a medical emergency. Another says it allows for the preservation of life in a medical emergency, defined as causing substantial and irreversible body of bodily impairment  which is not a medical term, experts say.                    To understand exactly how well Oklahoma hospitals understood the laws, the researchers used a secret shopper method, study co-author Dr. Michele Heisler said.                   Researchers posed as prospective patients and called 34 hospitals to ask about the emergency pregnancy care they offered.                   Heisler said that when the researchers designed the study, she expected the hospitals to tell the patients that they could get help in an emergency but that a second provider might have to sign off on an abortion or that a doctor would have to get the decision past an onerous hospital oversight committee.         What comes next after the Supreme Court blocked -- for now -- restrictions on abortion pills                What we werent expecting is that there would be so much confusion and contradictory information and really not clear information, said Heisler, who is medical director at Physicians for Human Rights and a professor of internal medicine and public health at the University of Michigan.                    The researchers said that none of the hospitals they contacted in Oklahoma was totally able to articulate clear, consistent policies for emergency obstetric care to potential patients.                   Specifically, 65%  22 of the 34 hospitals  were unable to provide information about policies, procedures or the support provided to doctors when it is clinically necessary to terminate a pregnancy to save the life of a pregnant patient.                   In 14 of the 22 cases, hospital representatives provided unclear and/or incomplete answers about whether doctors require approval to perform a medically necessary abortion.        Most adults value reproductive rights when deciding where to go to college, poll shows               Three of the hospitals said they do not provide abortions at all, even though it remains legal in the case of a medical emergency or to preserve the life of the pregnant person. Four others provided information that was factually wrong, the report says.                     Four hospitals said they had formal approval processes that clinicians must go through if they have a situation in which it is medically necessary to terminate a pregnancy; they cannot make that decision on their own.                   Three hospitals indicated that they have policies for these situations but refused to share any information about them.                   Unfortunately, it is being just left up to individual health systems and clinicians to try to make sense of these laws and provide guidance and support, Heisler said.                   The Oklahoma Hospital Association said it has been in conversations with Oklahomas medical licensure boards to seek clarity about the states conflicting abortion laws.        Florida Gov. DeSantis signs 6-week abortion ban               The association sent guidance to its members in September to explain what it interpreted as saving the life of a pregnant woman and what the laws would mean for a person made pregnant through rape or incest, among other issues. The guidance explains that the states criminal laws do not make an exception for these circumstances unless it is to save the life of someone who is pregnant in a medical emergency.                    The guidance also warns that a person convicted of administering, prescribing, advising, or procuring a woman to take any medicine drug or substance, or a person convicted of using or employing any instruction or other means whatever, with the intent to procure an abortion, shall be guilty of a felony punishable by two (2) to (5) years imprisonment. From August 27, 2022, forward, a person convicted of performing or attempting to perform an abortion shall be guilty of a felony punishable by a fine not to exceed One Hundred Thousand ($100,000.00) and/or imprisonment not to exceed ten (10) years.                   The guidance says the persons potentially liable are the provider, not the pregnant person.                   Study co-author Rabia Muqaddam, a senior staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights who is working on multiple cases challenging the abortion bans in Oklahoma, called the overlapping laws a ??bizarre?? situation.                    ??Aside from the fact that there are so many of them is that they all conflict,?? she said. ??All of the laws have inconsistent definitions, which is where a lot of the confusion comes from for health care providers. What??s most dangerous for patients is the fact that the definitions of medical emergency and life-preserving abortions is unclear and inconsistent.??     After fall of Roe, future doctors show less interest in training in states with abortion bans or as ob/gyns               ??If I was the hospital general counsel and I was looking at these laws, I have absolutely no idea what my physician could or could not do in any particular circumstance,?? she said.

CNNNews_77,"             In the year following the Supreme Court Dobbs decision, the abortion landscape in the United States became more fractured than ever.                   Abortions increased nationwide, according to a new report from #WeCount, a research project led by the Society of Family Planning  the average monthly change in the 12 months post-Dobbs compared to the two months pre-Dobbs adds up to about 2,200 more abortions over the course of a year.        See where abortions are banned and legal  and where its still in limbo               But the trends diverged sharply based on state policy, with abortions all but stopped in states with bans and significant increases in many states where abortion remained legal.                   There were about 115,000 fewer abortions in the 17 states with total or six-week bans in effect, plummeting 98% in banned states and dropping 40% in those with 6-week gestational limits, according to the new report. About a third of the overall decline can be attributed to Texas.                   The remaining 33 states where abortion remained legal, along with the District of Columbia, recorded nearly 117,000 more abortions  a 14% increase year-over-year.                   This is a sign of increasing inequality of access, said Caitlin Myers, a ?professor of economics at Middlebury College. Her research has focused on abortion trends, but she was not involved in the new analysis.                   Whether somebody who wants to access abortion can actually do so depends more than ever on where they live, she said.                   The #WeCount analysis tracks both procedural and medication abortions through data reported by providers, but it does not account for self-managed abortions such as those received through Aid Access that are not obtained within the formal US health care system.                   Much of the increase in states where abortion remains legal were among patients who traveled from states with bans or restrictions, experts say. The new report doesnt capture how widespread the need to travel for an abortion has become, but local data suggests a clear trend.                   There were 21,500 more abortions in Illinois in the year after the Dobbs decision, more than any other state, according to the new report. Nearly a quarter of patients that went to Planned Parenthood Illinois traveled from another state in that time, according to the organization  up from 7% before the Supreme Court decision. And Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains says that 90% of the increase theyve seen has been among out-of-state patients.                   Providers in Florida reported the third most abortions overall and the second largest increase, according to the new report. And more than 5,000 people have traveled from out-of-state to receive an abortion in Florida so far this year, according to data from the state health department  already more than in all of 2021.                   Abortion in the conservative state is currently legal but in limbo as the states Supreme Court weighs a challenge to restrict it. The situation there highlights the massive consequences that ongoing uncertainty threatens, experts say.                   Florida going dark would reverberate through the South and dramatically increase driving distances, Myers said. Displaced patients from within the state and others who relied on the clinics there would likely head north for care, and the flood of patients could create congestion in places like North Carolina or even Virginia, she said.                   Earlier research has shown that travel is a significant barrier. And even if additional resources help reduce the burden on patients, it shouldn??t be the gauge of success, experts say.        What is mifepristone, the drug at the heart of the Texas medication abortion lawsuit?               ??It??s really not a public health triumph that people have to mobilize the financial and social resources to travel, sometimes hundreds of miles away f",,4,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CNNNews_78,"             We didnt know if she was going to live or die, said Novaks husband, Stewart Day.                   Novak had a miscarriage in March and was prescribed only one of the pills in a two-pill combination approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for women in her situation.?Although the medication she took, called misoprostol, can help a woman have a complete and safe miscarriage, its not approved by the FDA to do so, and studies show that its less effective than when used in combination with the second drug, mifepristone.        How a medication abortion, also known as an abortion pill, works               Plaintiffs in the lawsuit are seeking to ban access nationwide to mifepristone. If they are successful, more women who need medication for miscarriage care will, like Novak, take only misoprostol.                   Obstetricians are very worried, said Dr. Erika Werner, a spokesperson for the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine. The concern is that if medication for miscarriage doesnt work, patients will end up having surgeries they hadnt anticipated.                   More women are going to have unnecessary surgeries. More women are going to have complications, said Werner, who is also chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Tufts Medical Center.                   At a hearing this month, a three-judge panel on the US 5th Circuit Court of Appeals showed sympathy for the arguments put forward by the plaintiffs, anti-abortion physicians and groups who?are challenging the FDAs approval of mifepristone 23 years ago.                   A decision from the circuit court is expected in the coming weeks, and the case will eventually head to the US Supreme Court.                   Dr. Christina Francis, chief executive officer of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, one of the plaintiffs in the case, told CNN that medical management of miscarriage with misoprostol has been standard of care for decades.                   It is vital that patients being treated with misoprostol for miscarriage management have a close follow-up scheduled to ensure that they have completely passed all pregnancy tissue and to determine whether additional treatment is needed. Women deserve the highest quality of reproductive healthcare, especially when faced with a situation as emotionally and physically traumatic as miscarriage, Francis added.       A New Years Eve kiss               Melissa Novak first spotted Stewart Day when he was standing at a beer cart at a New Years Eve festival in Fort Lauderdale in 2007.                   I saw him, and I was like, hes very attractive, and I tried to do a little dance to see if he would?check me out, and he did a little bit, Novak said.                   Three hours later, her friends asked her whom shed be kissing at midnight, and she remembered the cute guy at the beer cart and found him again.                   We kissed on New Years, and we havent been separate since, said Novak, now 39.                   We havent stopped talking, added Day, now 42.                   Novak, a social worker and sex therapist, and Day, an accountant, married on New Years Day three years later and, after a move to Chicago, settled in Atlanta.                   They were thrilled this year when they found out Novak was pregnant. Day, who always wanted a big family, ran to the store at all hours to get his wife soup, her only craving. They started to think about which room in their home theyd convert into a nursery and how they would decorate it.                   Their obstetrician scheduled an ultrasound at eight weeks.                   That was my first time in an ultrasound room, and the technician got it all set up and then just kind of looked at Melissa, and you could just kind of feel the mood in the room just sort of deflate, Day remembers.                   The ultrasound showed that the fetus had no heartbeat. Novak had had an early miscarriage.       Studies show advantages of drug combination               Early miscarriages are common, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which estimates that 10% of all clinically recognized pregnancies end in an early loss. After a fetus dies, its common for patients to need medical help to clear the tissue  sometimes referred to as terminating a pregnancy.                   Several studies have shown that the combination of mifepristone and misoprostol is more effective at terminating an early pregnancy than misoprostol alone.        The future of medication abortion in the US is uncertain. These women say theyre glad they got sterilized               One report looked at several studies and concluded that the combination of mifepristone and misoprostol was 95% to 98% effective. That report was published in 2006 in the journal Contraception.                   Another report detailed studies on a total of 12,829 people who received only misoprostol, and in 78% of the cases, the pregnancy was terminated completely without the use of surgery or additional medicine.?The authors of the study, published this year in Contraception, noted that this was a substantially lower proportion than the approximately 95% expected after the use of mifepristone and misoprostol together.                   Another study was a clinical trial in which doctors in the US randomly assigned 300 women with an early pregnancy loss to receive misoprostol either alone or in combination with mifepristone. Among those receiving the combination, 84% had a complete expulsion of the pregnancy, and among those receiving misoprostol only, 67% had a complete expulsion.                   The authors, writing in 2018 in the New England Journal of Medicine, concluded that the drug combination resulted in a higher likelihood of successful management of first-trimester pregnancy loss than treatment with misoprostol alone.                   Francis, the anti-abortion activist and plaintiff in the federal litigation, pointed to another study in NEJM, also a clinical trial, that found that of 491 women who received misoprostol alone after early pregnancy failure, 84% had complete expulsion within eight days.       How in 2023 can this happen to us?               When Novak had her miscarriage in March, she says, her obstetrician explained her options: have surgery, called a D&C, to remove the pregnancy or use medication to help the miscarriage along.                   Novak chose to have medication, and her doctor prescribed misoprostol  alone, not in combination with mifepristone.        How safe is the abortion pill compared with other common drugs               Nine days after taking the medicine, Novak spiked a fever.                   Thinking she had just caught a cold from her nephews, Novak took Advil, felt better, got in her car and went out on errands.                   Two hours later, while driving, she felt her fever go up and had intense back pain.                   ??I knew I was crashing,?? she said. ??I had neve",,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CNNNews_79,"             What they both wanted for their lives, what their boundaries were with contraception and what they would do if faced with an unintended pregnancy were all things the 21-year-old started talking about early and continues discussing with her partner.                   For many couples, those conversations are taking on a bigger importance, given the US Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade and the federal protection to abortion access that came with it. Some people may feel that talking about sex, protection and unplanned pregnancy is more important now than ever, said Kristen Mark, a sex and relationships researcher and professor in family medicine and community health at the University of Minnesota Medical Schools Institute for Sexual and Gender Health in Minneapolis.         Women share how access to abortion impacted their lives -- whether they chose one or not               People need to understand that in many states their options may be limited practically overnight or, if not overnight, then within weeks or months, said Debby Herbenick, director of Indiana University Bloomingtons Center for Sexual Health Promotion. She is also a professor at IUs School of Public Health.                   Depending on the state, the loss or potential loss of access to abortion may have some people rethinking what they need in a partner and under what circumstances they are comfortable having sex, said Julia Bennett, director of digital education and learning strategy for Planned Parenthood Federation of America.                   Fortunately, the teens and young adults Chicago-based therapist John Duffy works with are already more comfortable than the generations before them talking about sexual health and protection. Whether or not they are already in a sexual relationship, many of them are talking with partners, friends, groups and communities about both the politics and logistics of safe sex, he said.                    In the wake of the decision and some state laws against abortion that have already gone into effect, experts are urging people to have direct conversations early on about what it means for a couple in any kind of intimate relationship.                   A generation ago, when a person found out they were unintentionally pregnant, the question that followed was what is she going to do? said therapist Duffy. Today, more than ever, its becoming, what are we going to do? he said.                   While the conversation can feel taboo or scary, knowing what your partners concerns and requirements are in the event of an unintended pregnancy is important to ensure you are supporting one another in creating a safe environment for you both, he said.        In her 'SNL' skit, Cecily Strong opened a dialogue on abortion. Here is what experts say                Ideally, were prepared as opposed to reacting, Duffy said. If youre in a state where this is enacted and you might not have a lot of financial resources or the ability to get out of state, the best move is to have that discussion beforehand.                   Overturning Roe v. Wade may be adding stress and anxiety for some people that makes it difficult to have a safe, healthy and pleasurable sex life, Bennett said.                    Having these conversations can help those people decide if they feel comfortable moving forward sexually or if the partnership is not worth the risk of pregnancy, Duffy said.                    A super common issue that arises within relationships, casual or long-term, is lack of communication, Mark said in an email. Approaching conversations about sex can be really difficult due to the stigma our society places on sex and the lack of guidance provided through our incredibly limited access to medically accurate and comprehensive sex education. But it is totally necessary.       Sign up for CNNs Stress, But Less newsletter. Our six-part mindfulness guide will inform and inspire you to reduce stress while learning how to harness it.               Whether couples are thinking about having sex or already are and have a casual or intimate relationship, Duffy recommended having conversations about contraception and abortion  and having them early.                   When it comes to communication, being honest and direct about your boundaries and your feelings is a really good place to start off, Bennett said.         Amazon and Rite Aid limiting purchases of emergency contraception               You can talk about how the decision is affecting your mental health and how it might affect your decision-making around sex, she added.                    One way in could be to start by talking about what your access to reproductive health care looks like together, Marks said.                   ??Have a plan for if an unintended pregnancy does happen. Talk about where you would go or what you would do,?? she said.                   That plan can include cost, travel and time off work if you were to choose to seek an abortion, Herbenick said.                    It??s a good opportunity to feel out a partner, Duffy said.

CNNNews_80,"             Senate Democratic candidates immediately tried to link their Republican opponents to Grahams bill, but the South Carolina Republican defended his legislation as a bulwark against late-term abortions.                   I think the Democrats made a huge mistake in introducing legislation in Washington that would basically allow abortion up to the moment of birth, Graham told CNN. Now we have an alternative to that.                   The courts decision in June set off a nationwide scramble to define the legal rights to an abortion, after it found nearly 50 years ago a constitutional right to it.         Abortion is banned or severely limited in a number of states. Here's where things stand               In May, the Senate failed to advance a Democratic bill establishing a federal right to terminate a pregnancy until fetal viability, or later if theres a risk to the pregnant patients life or health. (Fetal viability occurs around 22 to 24 weeks into a pregnancy.) Grahams bill, which has no chance of passing in a Democratic-controlled Senate, provides exceptions for abortions required to protect the life of the mother, and if the woman becomes pregnant through rape or incest.                   Senate Republicans were slow on Tuesday to embrace Grahams plan.                   Ill look at it, said Florida Sen. Rick Scott, who chairs the Senate GOP campaign committee.                   Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, who is in a tough reelection race, would not directly answer when asked if he backs Grahams bill. Johnson said abortion laws should be decided by we the people in the 50 states. The Supreme Courts decision resurrected Wisconsins abortion ban, which was passed in 1849.        New Hampshire's GOP primary will complete the Senate battleground map               South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the GOP Whip, defended the new legislation, saying it will give GOP candidates a place to land as they get hammered by Democrats on the issue. He said most Republicans favor abortion restrictions, not an outright ban. Thune told CNN he supported the 15-week ban.                   I would expect there would be pretty good support for that among, you know, pro-life Republicans and maybe some pro-life Democrats, Thune said.                    I also think that because the Democrats have tried to convert this into a one-sided argument that represents their singular view of the world, which is all Republicans are for an outright ban, Thune added. I think this changes that narrative and gives candidates a place to be for something that reflects their views and doesnt fit the Democrats narrative.                   But Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a member of GOP leadership, had a different view of Grahams bill.                    I think there are going to be some differences of opinion, said Cornyn. My preference is to have each state handle those issues.                   Asked why he thought Graham put forward the legislation, Cornyn responded, Ask Sen. Graham.                   North Carolina Sen.

Under the states constitution, legislation proposed in Nebraska is required to be limited to a single topic.

CNNNews_82,"             After a night out, a coworker had brought her to her home and raped her, an experience that came to haunt  her when they would run into one another in the casino where they worked.                   Now  as a result of that attack  she was pregnant.                   Blakely had an abortion. She knew the decision was right for her at the time and, she felt, was reinforced as she went through trauma treatment for her attack  and as the man continued to stalk her, sending flowers and showing up at her house.                    If I didnt have access to an abortion in 2017, I would not be here right now. I was going through so much emotional turmoil, Blakely said. I couldnt imagine carrying my rapists child to term.        Why overturning Roe v. Wade would be a disaster for conservatives                She is one of many people who are intently watching the outcome of a United States Supreme Court hearing over access to abortion; oral arguments began Wednesday. The justices are being asked to uphold a Mississippi ban on abortions after 15 weeks. The courts decision could overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark decision legalizing abortion nationwide prior to viability, which can occur at around 24 weeks of pregnancy.                   Not every abortion comes out of a traumatic attack, but Blakely said it makes her angry to think about people not being able to make their own decisions about carrying a pregnancy.                    As lawyers go before the Supreme Court, women who have sat with the decision shared with CNN what access to abortion meant to them  both in times they chose to do it and times they did not.                    After Megan Jeyifo had an abortion, she remembers taking a taxi home by herself, putting on her gray sweats, lying down in her bed and feeling relief wash over her.                   At the time she was 16 years old, had just lost a parent and knew then she was not ready to have a child.                    My abortion was something I knew I wanted the minute I found out I was pregnant, Jeyifo said. It took me some time to figure out how to actually make it happen.       Planned Parenthood offers sexual health care across the US.My Choice Network can help locate a clinic near you.For pregnant people who are looking for health and financial help, the US Department of Health and Human Services has gathered resources.               She said she was raised in a family that was pro-choice, but the stigma around abortion and teenage pregnancy left her worried that she would not be supported. As a result, she navigated the process of getting an abortion on her own.                   There are young women who get pregnant unexpectedly and can raise children and want to do it, Jeyifo said. Now that she is a mother, though, she sees even more clearly what she saw then: how difficult lack of support resources makes choosing to be a teenage mother.                    I feel such relief now, when I look at my life and I look at my children, that I was able to get that abortion because my life would look really different now, Jeyifo said.                    Kenya Martin now calls her 21-year-old daughter her broke best friend and thinks she is perfect, but she is also transparent with her adult child that there was a time she heavily considered not going through with her pregnancy.                    Having access to abortion really enabled me to be a better parent, Martin said. When its time for her to be safe with making these important life decisions, she can do that without feeling like shes forced to.                   She knows that shes supported in whatever her choice is.        I almost died trying to get an abortion. I'm terrified my students could face a similar fate               Martin was in college and had just started seeing someone when she got pregnant with her daughter. She turned to her parents to discuss her options when it came to whether to go through with the pregnancy.                    Having children had been in her vision for her future, but she was worried that she did not know the man she would be raising a child with well enough and that, having to drop out of college to have the baby, it might not be the most financially stable time in her life to bring in a child.                   ??Motherhood was really dark in the beginning,??

The new legislation likely further burnishes the conservative credentials of DeSantis, a potential 2024 presidential candidate, and it was met with outrage by state Democrats, two of whom were arrested during a protest near the state Capitol Monday night.                   The current bill would impose restrictions on telehealth abortions and medication. It would include exemptions for women facing life-threatening harm while pregnant and victims of rape, incest and human trafficking.

They say their doctors told them she would either be stillborn or die very quickly after birth.                   The Maberrys wanted to terminate the pregnancy, but a near-complete abortion ban in their state doesnt have exceptions for birth defects  even severe ones like anencephaly.                   The Maberrys went out of state to end the pregnancy, but their insurance, Kentucky Medicaid, wouldnt pay for it. They wanted to induce birth so they could hold Willow, but that wouldve cost them tens of thousands of dollars. Instead, they had to settle for a much less expensive surgical procedure  but that procedure does not leave the fetus intact.                   Were grieving pictures, Heather said. Were grieving a blanket.                   Still distraught after his daughters death, Nick sleeps with Willows blanket and has not been able to return to his job as a factory worker.                   I was devastated, he said.

It just isnt right, she said.                   CNN reached out to three sponsors of Kentucky abortion laws to ask why fatal fetal anomalies arent an exception to the current laws. None of them responded.                   Nick and Heather knew each other in high school in Stanton, Kentucky, and then met again years later through mutual friends. They married in March 2022 and settled in their hometown.                   Nick, now 34, had four children of his own and Heather, now 32, had three. They wanted a baby together, and she became pregnant, only to miscarry in October.                   On December 23, they found out Heather was pregnant again.

CNNNews_85,"             Since the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade in June, promising strategies have emerged to protect abortion rights in individual states. Some have begun to pass ballot initiatives to preserve or create state constitutional protection. Others have looked to legislatures to shield doctors and those who help people seeking abortion from potential consequences in conservative states.                     These wins are hardly a silver bullet: not all states allow ballot initiatives and there are any number of states where majorities of voters seem to support abortion rights but are governed by legislators who want to ban the procedurea result of deep partisan divides, gerrymandering and limits on access to the vote.                     Just the same, supporters of abortion rights have made the most of the best strategies available to them, bolstered by the fact that most Americans support at least some access to legal abortion.                   This is, in part, why antiabortion groups have gotten creative and developed new strategies to cut off access to abortion, even in states where voting majorities have already chosen to guarantee it. An obvious target is abortion pills, which now account for more than half the procedures in the United States.          Opinion: What the FDA's moves on abortion pills mean for the future               But the latest approach by abortion opponents to disrupt access in blue states is an archaic law: the Comstock Act, passed in 1873 mainly to target what Anthony Comstock, an anti-vice crusader, viewed as dirty books. Comstock, who was made a special agent of the US Postal Service, was obsessed by what he saw as the decaying morals of a country preoccupied with sex.                     The law he inspired barred not just the mailing of obscene books but also birth control and abortion drugs and devices. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Comstock Act was used to prohibit the mailing of many literary classics, from Geoffrey Chaucers The Canterbury Tales to works by James Joyce and Walt Whitman.                    Comstock himself proudly carried a gun and scoured the mail for cases involving information about abortion or contraception, even if a doctor provided it. By Comstocks standard, the law was a great success: he claimed to have destroyed 15 tons of books, arrested more than 4,000 people and driven at least 15 people to suicide.                    But by the time Comstock died in 1915, Americans were having second thoughts about his crusade and courts started to limit the application of the law. Judges suggested that there were lawful uses of some drugs, like contraceptives, and that the Comstock Act applied only to those who intended to violate the law. That meant that doctors validly prescribing certain medications might be exempt from the Comstock Act, as would patients acting under a physicians advice.                    Some members of the antiabortion movement are pushing for a comeback for the Comstock Act, fighting for local ordinances that assert an obligation to follow federal law, including the Comstock Act.                    The Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), a socially conservative group, has filed a lawsuit in Texas that hinges on application of Comstocks law. These groups suggest that the Comstock Act applies far more broadlyto the mailing of any abortion pill, to anyone, anywhere. They question the interpretation of the law offered by courts  since the 1910sand stress that this interpretation only ever applied to birth control, not abortion drugs.         Opinion: On the 50th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, I can't stop thinking about how abortion changed my life               While the Department of Justice under the Biden administration has already rejected this argument, that seems unlikely to dissuade antiabortion groups. Their hope is surely to bring their arguments about the Comstock Act to conservative judges??and ultimately, to the conservative supermajority of the US Supreme Court.                   The goal for many leaders of the antiabortion movement in the US is a national ban on abortion??preferably, one that recognizes the personhood of the fetus and establishes that abortion itself is unconstitutional. Given the Supreme Court??s composition, this kind of personhood argument may eventually capture the support of the justices, but likely not anytime soon.

CNNNews_87,"             In one of the most high-profile abortion cases since the fall of Roe V. Wade, a Texas woman has been battling the state to terminate her high-risk pregnancy  a legal dispute that could have ripple effects for many as the Texas law, one of the strictest in the country, is tested.                   Kate Cox, a 31-year-old mother of two, filed a lawsuit last week to end a pregnancy she and her doctors say threatens her life and future fertility.  The case triggered a tense legal battle with the eyes of the country watching. The Texas Supreme Court ruled against her on Monday after she left the state to pursue the procedure.                   The lawsuit is believed to be one of the first attempts in the country by someone seeking a court-ordered abortion since the Supreme Court?last year overturned Roe v. Wade, according to?the New York Times. The 1973 US Supreme Court ruling established a constitutional right to abortion before fetal viability.                   Heres what we know so far about Cox  and what her case reveals about the state of abortion law in a post-Roe America.                   Coxs name came into the public sphere when she filed a lawsuit against the state of Texas on December 5, asking a court to declare she has the right to terminate her pregnancy.                   Cox was 20 weeks pregnant when she sued. Her fetus had been diagnosed with a rare and deadly genetic condition called trisomy 18.        Post-Roe, nearly 1 in 5 people seeking an abortion traveled out of state, analysis finds               Im trying to do what is best for my baby daughter and myself and my family, but we are suffering because of the laws in Texas, Cox wrote in an op-ed for the Dallas Morning News about her abortion fight. I do not want my baby to arrive in this world only to watch her suffer.                   I need to end my pregnancy now so that I have the best chance for my health, for parenting my children, and for a future pregnancy, she added.                   Trisomy 18, sometimes called Edwards syndrome, is a rare chromosomal condition that can cause heart defects and other organ abnormalities. Almost all pregnancies end in miscarriage or stillbirth, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Of the babies that do survive full-term, no more than 10% survive past their first birthday, says the clinic.                   The lawsuit states Cox had been to three different emergency rooms over the last month due to severe cramping and unidentifiable fluid leaks.                   Because Ms. Cox has had two prior cesarean surgeries (C-sections), continuing the pregnancy puts her at high risk for severe complications threatening her life and future fertility, including uterine rupture and hysterectomy, the lawsuit states.        See where abortions are banned and legal  and where its still in limbo               In 2021, Texas?banned abortions?after fetal cardiac activity is detected, usually around six weeks of pregnancy - before many people know they are pregnant. When the?Supreme Court overturned?federal abortion rights the following summer, a trigger law came into effect, essentially blocking all abortions other than those when the mother is at risk of death or poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function unless the abortion is performed or induced.                   In addition to criminalizing abortions, Texas also allows private citizens to file a civil lawsuit against anyone who knowingly aids or abets an abortion.                   What exactly is necessary to protect the life of the mother is the key area of contention. Cox has said despite her pain and medical problems during her pregnancy, the law is too vague to determine whether an abortion under her circumstances would be legal.                   Ms. Coxs physicians have informed her that their hands are tied and she will have to wait until her baby dies inside her or carry the pregnancy to term, at which point she will be forced to have a third C-section, only to watch her baby suffer until death, the lawsuit states.                   On December 7, a district court judge ruled Cox could legally terminate her pregnancy. In an emergency ruling, the judge granted a temporary restraining order against the state that would allow Cox to immediately have an abortion.                   The idea that Mrs. Cox wants desperately to be a parent, and this law might actually cause her to lose that ability is shocking and would be a genuine miscarriage of justice, Judge Maya Guerra Gamble said in her ruling.                   After the ruling, Texas Attorney General Ken?Paxton?warned Coxs physician she could still face civil and criminal penalties at some point should Cox undergo the procedure, which could include first-degree felony prosecutions and civil penalties of at least $100,000 for each violation. Paxton petitioned for immediate intervention from the state??s supreme court, arguing Cox did not demonstrate her pregnancy was threatening her life.

Last year, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen made a similar argument to the Financial Oversight Council.                     I believe that eliminating the right of women to make decisions about when and whether to have children would have very damaging effects on the economy and would set women back decades, Yellen told lawmakers in May.                    The lack of abortion access has the greatest economic impact on women of color, especially those already in dire financial conditions, according to Banerjee.                    In many of these states, especially the states which have banned abortion, many of the women who are facing economic challenges already are also women of color, she said.                   Raising the minimum wage is a powerful tool that has been known to have significant impact on closing racial income gaps. But nearly two-thirds of abortion restrictive states have a $7.25 minimum wage, the lowest legal hourly wage for most workers in the United States.                   The average minimum wage across the 26 states is $8.17, lower than the average $11.92 for states with no restrictions. (Many of those states also have a higher cost of living, however.)                    If the person denied an abortion is also working a minimum wage job, the negative economic effect is compounded, the report states.                   Many of those low-wage jobs also do not offer benefits like health care, which is why access to Medicaid is critical.                   Medicaid is a lifeline for low-income families and low-income women when jobs might not offer adequate healthcare. Medicaid in the immediate postpartum period is especially important,?? said Banerjee.                   Just 12 states have not expanded Medicaid benefits since the 2010 Obamacare law, and all of them have restrictive abortion policies.                    However, some states with total abortion bans, with few exceptions, have expanded Medicaid, including Missouri. And in five other abortion restrictive states (Idaho, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma and South Dakota later this year) residents voted to expand the benefit.                    Access to unemployment insurance is another key indicator of a state??s commitment to economic support for residents. Forty-two percent of residents have access to unemployment benefits in states that have abortion protections. Compare that to 30% in states with abortion restrictions.                    Even if unemployment is accessible, the amount differs from state to state. For example, in Mississippi, a state with a total abortion ban with limited exceptions, weekly un",,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CNNNews_90," One lawsuit was filed by GenBioPro, a major manufacturer of mifepristone, which is the first drug used in the medication abortion process, in West Virginia challenging the states laws limiting access to the drug, including the outright ban on abortion lawmakers passed last year.        The second lawsuit was filed by an OB-GYN in North Carolina and targets the requirements that state places on obtaining abortion pills that go beyond the federal standards for provision of medication abortion.        Activists preparing for 'an absolutely crazy year' in first full statehouse sessions since Supreme Court overturned Roe                 The lawsuits represent one of several new legal battlefronts that have emerged since the Supreme Courts June ruling that reversed the decades-old Roe v. Wade precedent protecting abortion rights nationwide, allowing states to implement restrictions and bans on the procedure.                    Medication abortion, which now makes up a majority of abortions obtained in the United States, has become a particularly acute flashpoint in the fallout from the Supreme Courts decision. In November, anti-abortion advocates sued the US Food and Drug Administration, seeking to block its 20-year-old approval of mifepristone; the Texas federal court where that lawsuit was filed could rule as early as next month whether the FDA??s abortion pill policies should be halted.                   While many states already have laws that prohibit medication abortion, legislators have signaled they??ll be exploring new ways to clamp down on the avenues abortion-seekers hav",,4,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
