### Research Question ###

* Are media outlets regarding abortion-related news often framed according to their political or ideological perspectives?

### Data ###

* The sample design involves a stratified selection, ensuring representation from left-leaning, right-leaning, and centrist media. This design virtue allows for nuanced comparisons across the political spectrum. For mredia political habits, please refer to https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2014/10/21/political-polarization-media-habits/. Currently I only have coupora for BBC and FOX, but I will add more in the following weeks.

### Method ###

* Using word embeddings analyze whether outlets from different media share similar attitudes regarding abortion.
* Using topic modeling to discover whether they have preference in outleting abortion related news, for example real life abortion story vs. legislation.
* Will add the third one soon.
